Ricker Basin, Vermont
Picking the site between two small rivers, they named Cotton and Stevenson Brooks; Ricker Basin was finished in 1783. They built three gristmills using the power of the rivers to grind the grain. Things worked well enough until a flood destroyed most of their homes and all the mills in 1827. That level of destruction sent them away, and it was good they’d emigrated out. A second storm generated another biblical flood nine years later, washing almost everything else away. There wasn’t much of the town left in the wild woods of Vermont: a ghost town hard to find.
The Waterbury Reservoir was in Little River State Park. Ricker Basin was four miles away from the reservoir. When the state absorbed the land around the reservoir, it obtained the town through eminent domain. Workers dismantled most of the Basin in 1960, with only one exception. Residents in Waterbury remembered Ricker Basin, and they petitioned the local government to let Calvin Goodall’s house stand. The ancient dwelling sat on the highest elevation between the rivers, weathering through the floods. Their proposal was accepted, certifying the house as a historical monument. No one would see Goodall’s house after the demolition workers left the area, so it really was a pointless endeavor. At least they got the rest of the work done faster and cheaper.
Years yawned into decades. No one heard the old house creak and sigh. No one went out there. No one remembered the place anymore. The bricks from the gristmills had fallen to the bottom of the rivers, just shattered bones as the living fingers of the forest weaved into was left of Ricker Basin to divide and conquer. The Goodall home guarded over emptiness…until coincidence rang a silent alarm, awakening a force that had been hibernating there for decades.
Spraying paint on the walls of his church heated him up. Billy took his shirt off, tossing it on a broken fence post, happy to finally work in a T-shirt. It’s been too cold to do that for months. After three years of work, his town was almost done—well, the façade of it anyway. He’d built five houses, a general store, and a church on an unpaved track he called ‘main street.’
He put the paint gun down and limped over to the bed of his truck to find his cigarettes. They were wedged under his toolbox. He lit one and leaned against the side of his F350, puffing out smoke rings. At forty-two, his body had responded valiantly to his obsession, and his hair and goatee only had a few streaks of grey to acknowledge those years.
Locked in a federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut, from 1972 to 1978, Billy Leiden had been set free right after his thirtieth birthday. He’d returned to construction, falling twenty-eight feet off a ladder on a job in upstate New York in 1981, breaking his hip and skull. He was in a coma for over a month. The insurance company was dismayed when he woke up. The ambulance-chasing lawyers quickly found something wrong with the ladder. The company and the developer both settled out of court, paying him nine million dollars in reparations a year after the accident. Billy ended up with four million dollars in his bank account. The Montano Company, who had been using the Light-Brite Ladders at their construction sites, took them out of circulation and started their own suit against the company. But that had nothing to do with Billy.
His rehab ended in 1983, and his balance problems were resolved. With capital in the bank, he set off in his brand new F350 north on Interstate 95. His friend Butch Dawes lives in a ramshackle farmhouse in Waterbury, Vermont, and he’d decided to stop by.
When Billy arrived, they drank beer and watched sports games on TV. The next day, they tramped into the woods to hunt. They went off on their own for a while. Billy followed hoof prints into some dense foliage that opened into a sunny clearing, and that was when he saw the Goodall house. It burned into him. It could have been the classic carpentry or the aura linked to the shadowy building, but whatever it was, he was drawn towards that house. He hobbled around the site. He found the old foundations where other buildings had been, and he understood a small town had once been there. Something clicked in Billy’s mind. Walking into the cemetery, he sat on a gravestone, transfixed by his revelation.
He’d raise the dead! He would build a stairway to heaven, a passage to allow the lost souls to haunt the world again… perhaps directing them, even controlling them.
Meeting his friend back on the trail a few hours later, he didn’t tell him what he’d found, yet he did act like he’d won the lotto or so. Butch thought he’d hit his head on a rock.
Billy bought the town. The state employees in Montpelier accepted his generous bid, installing a clause in the transfer papers releasing them from any liability for anything that went wrong on that land. He returned to Montpelier three weeks later with a bank check of one hundred thousand dollars printed out to the state of Vermont. Mr. Leiden now owned thirty-seven acres of land, including Ricker Basin. It was hard to get there, and the place had no electricity or running water, but he stayed ecstatic. He believed his revelation would come true.
Billy started his dream with a chainsaw, cutting away the overgrowth on the back trail from Riker Basin to Little River Road, and it took him three days. After that, he was able to haul two generators plus a John Deere tractor with a backhoe up that bumpy track to the Basin.
For him to stay in the Goodall house involved replacing weight-bearing beams, floors, and interior walls, and he hadn’t had enough time to get that done before winter. Besides, the godforsaken trail was still not flat enough to plow yet. He stayed in a rooming house in Montpelier and poured over blueprints for the spring construction. He’d drive over to Butch’s house twice a week and hang out, but in April, he went to work. He intended to stay at Ricker Basin next winter. The dirt road would be set up for plowing by the end of the summer.
Using a wellpoint, he found water near the house. He installed a well, number one on his list. Upgrading the conditions in and around the house, Billy changed the swaybacked ruin into a livable home: two bathrooms, a full kitchen, electric lights, and a fireplace. Even propane heat.
Since he was not an architect nor an engineer. Ricker Basin's resurrection had not come out quite right, but to Billy, it was magnificent. No one told him that one of the roof lines might be slightly tilted or that a windowsill could be a smidgeon off true.
He’d painted one house light blue and another yellow. The rest were white, and all the roof shingles were grey. The windows had blinds and curtains, and a sign outside the front entrance of the general store announced there was a sale on millet seed and fertilizer. The church's windows were colorful with stained glass, and all the doorknobs were brass, gleaming like gold in the sun.
If a backpacker walked into the lost village, she might think things were fine at first. Billy had screwed numbers on the doors of his houses, oddly beginning with twenty-nine.
Dealing with the project alone, he was losing control over the property. A vine had grown across the porch of a house, creeping under the front door. He hadn’t fixed that yet, and across the dirt road, a tree had rebirthed itself out of a stump he’d left in the foundations of another building. The branches of that tree had broken a side window from the inside out. Besides Goodall’s place, the only other building in Ricker Basin with a second floor was the first house he’d built, and he’d that rough. The remaining houses, the church, and the store had no interior walls.
The forest was creeping back into the town, and Billy was fighting it haphazardly. A white birch stood at the entrance of his church while roots busted into sections of Main Street. The boundaries of his twilight town were unraveling, but he was too preoccupied to control it. It was almost ready. His town would be the bridge for the departed to be set free. What would a few weeds matter?
3:27 PM Saturday, May 17, 1986
Waterbury, Vermont
Route 100 crossed the Winooski River in the center of Waterbury, and there was a hairpin curve right after the bridge. It was tricky if the road iced up. Half a mile away, the hardware store’s owner had just rung up Billy Leiden’s items. Holding a bag of hinges, Billy pushed through the door that slammed behind him. Clarence was stocking shelves in the back, and he heard it. He untied his work apron and slipped it over his head. Tossing the apron over a large cardboard display for windshield washer fluid, he sprinted through the front door. His father was still at the register, and he was boring holes in his son’s back with a baleful stare. Clarence trotted up behind Billy.
“I know you’re building something out there in the woods. I need to know what it is...hello...HELLO!” 
Billy ignored him and kept on walking to his truck parked on the other side of the street. The maroon paint on his vehicle was coated in dirt, and in his mind, he was mulling over buying another. That irritating voice punched into his head a second time.
“I’ve seen you at the store before, but you never hang out in town. You’re never anywhere. I watched you haul a John Deere around that crazy corner near the river. I don’t know how you managed it! I followed you on my dirt bike, but you were long gone.”
Billy got in his truck and snapped, “Go away.” He started the engine.
“Hunters were in the store yesterday, telling my dad they saw a lot of construction where Ricker Basin used to be.”
The driver’s window closed, and the truck began rolling down the street. That didn’t stop Clarence. He jogged along with the truck, talking louder so Billy could still hear him.
“You might not know it, but there are ghosts in the Goodall house…and all around the Basin, too. I’ve heard stories. Be careful if that’s where you’re going!” 
The word ‘ghosts’ had triggered Billy. He stopped the truck and lowered the window. “What are you talking about? You don’t know shit about that place. I know what’s up there!”
Clarence was happy. His guess had worked…but there was no time to congratulate himself. Stepping closer to the truck, he brushed his brown bangs out of his eyes.
“You are working in Ricker Basin.” Clarence was using an easy northern drawl in his voice. Billy stared at him. Leiden pushed everybody away, but this time, he found himself stuck between curiosity and disdain. The kid was almost six feet tall, fingernails painted black, and his jeans were ripped to shreds. He didn’t look like a country boy, more like a version of Alice Cooper.
“Why do you want to tell me ghost stories about Ricker Basin?” Billy asked.
“I know the legends connected to the Basin are mostly crap. I don’t really want to tell you anything at all. Listen, man, I’m bored shitless. I know you’re doing something up there, and it might be a starting point for my own project…and I could give you free labor for the opportunity.”
Curiosity won the battle, and Billy laughed. This wild child did have charisma. He might be a kindred spirit. Maybe give him some ideas to populate his ghost town.
“What’s your name?”  
“Clarence Hanson. What’s yours?”
“Billy.” Opening the truck door, he shook Clarence's hand. “There are no ghosts in Ricker Basin. The only thing I hear or see at night are bears going through my garbage. I’ve lived in the Goodall house for two years, so I know. Oh, by the way, it’s my town. I own Ricker Basin. Could have changed the name to Leiden Basin if I’d wanted to. Right now, I’m almost done with the first part of my plan, so if you’re interested, I wouldn’t mind advice on my next step.”
12:14 PM Sunday, May 18, 1986
Ricker Basin, Vermont
Migrating birds had returned to Ricker Basin. The melody of their songs blended above the boisterous rush of the brooks swelling in the spring thaw. Out of hibernation, everything sprouted. A patina of green fairy dust covered the forest floor, and oak branches that had looked dead now had verdant buds.
If Billy Leiden hadn’t found Ricker Basin, if he hadn’t rebuilt these ruins with his manic devotion, the town and anything connected to it would have disappeared...or possibly fallen asleep. Nailing boards on those old rotten bones, he had not known what he’d done.
Inviting him to have lunch with him, Billy gave Clarence directions to reach the playground. An hour later, the teenager parked his motorcycle next to the swing set. Billy was relaxing on the low wall of the sandbox.
“Your town wasn’t too hard to find.”
“Hello, Clarence.”
“Before eating, can I look at those buildings of yours?” 
“Sure. Go ahead. I give you permission to look at whatever you want.”
Hanging his helmet on the mirror of his bike, he turned on his heel to check the town out.
Billy had built the playground for a reason, believing it would attract children’s spirits. He bought a swing set, a slide, a jungle gym, and extra hardwood for the sandbox. Clearing an acre near the cemetery a year ago, he set the equipment up. But there was no response from any ghost from any age group and no supernatural event of any kind. No floating orbs of light. No twig sculptures are left under the jungle gym. Nothing at all happened.
He never forgot the conversation he’d had with a spirit he’d created after a bloody transformation he’d initiated with a switchblade in 1971. That disjointed talk had given him the evidence he needed, and the new physicality of Ricker Basin was going to be a clarion call Billy needed. The lost souls would hear this invitation and come out of their graves and haunt in extravagance. But. It. Was. Not. Happening.
Stymied, their return was something he badly craved…and there had to be a way to get them here one way or another!
Returning from his trip through the Basin, Clarence sat on the swings next to Billy. They ate the ham and cheese sandwiches Billy had bought at the luncheonette in Waterbury. They jawed over the history of the town. They’d heard the story of a trapper’s disappearance in 1940, camping next to Stevenson Brook. He’d fallen into the water and drowned. Supposedly, a manifestation of one of the first settlers was responsible for tossing him into the creek. Clarence told Billy another muddled tale about a jealous husband, a dead hound dog, and a drunken hunter. The stories went on until Billy finally decided to invite the boy into his own dementia, explaining his plan and the current dilemma. He needed advice to get the final result accomplished.
Clarence looked over at him. “You built this ghost town in the woods with no ghosts? Not even a nibble, and you haven’t come up with other ideas to fix that?”
“I don’t know how to bring them here or even wake them up. No clue...well, I know of an easy way, but that’s not something I can tell you about right now.”
Clarence knew Billy Leiden was psychotic, and he wanted to use this knowledge to manipulate the man’s insanity for his own devices. Ricker Basin was perfect. It was a malleable environment. He could create his own devilish plans, and together, they really could fill this town with spirits and wraiths fresh off the highway of butchery. Of course, for Clarence, murder was the point since he didn’t think ghosts really existed.
“Exasperation is dripping out of you like sweat, Bill. You’re worried. At least you found the gumption to ask me for guidance.” The easy rhythm in his words went on, “And I’ll give it to you. You have a travesty here, an empty vessel. We can’t leave it empty! The atmosphere here will soon be heavenly, haunted with young female spirits.”
Billy’s eyebrows rose. Did Clarence have the same desire to bring his dream to life using murder as the tool to make it work?
“Finding a way to create new spirits would be great!” Billy said. “Right now, I don’t know how to invite anything into the ethereal world without...”
Clarence interrupted him, “When I go to school tomorrow, I’ll put my plan into play. The local stories will make this place appealing to other students. I’ll print out invitations about a haunted weekend…selecting certain candidates. If they’re interested, I’ll tell them the ‘history’ of Ricker Basin and get them revved up about meeting ghosts out here. We can help them with that. Don’t worry, Billy. I’ll invite the right guests you need very soon, be here in a few weeks. We’ll fill this empty jug to the top. The Basin will soon be haunted.” 
As they hashed out the scheme, Billy really thought it would work, bringing ghosts to the town by hook or by crook. In the following days, he looked around at different tools on the property and in his house that might be used in that process…
11:48AM Monday, May 19, 1986
Harwood High School, South Duxbury, Vermont 
Kevin Fielding was eighteen. Tall and skinny, he’d pack on some muscle in a year. He had not made up his mind about his career, but his gifts were already making that decision for him. Prophecy, one of his abilities, was now sending him in a dangerous direction.
Padlocking his books in his locker, he walked to the cafeteria. Passing an empty classroom, Kevin saw Clarence talking to some girls, and he got a feeling in his belly. Months ago, he’d ‘felt’ menace swirling around that guy, but those feelings didn’t fit now. He now smelled smoke, a psychic fire erupting into an inferno. People might get hurt very soon. He must check these warning signs. His conscience would pester him if he didn’t.
Putting lunch on a tray, he sat down and swallowed his fish sticks and carrots like a robot. He was miles away. As other students at the table compared notes, laughed, or gossiped, he stayed quiet. Kevin watched Clarence enter the cafeteria, and the two girls he’d seen him talking to in the classroom were with him. They sat four tables away. Kevin stood up and moved past them. They were still whispering. His concern grew. Noticing some of his acquaintances at a table right next to Clarence, he sat down with them. That allowed him to be physically and psychically close enough to tune in to their murmurings...
“A haunted weekend at Ricker Basin set up just for you,” Clarence said, breathing those words out with hypnotic power. “It will include a confrontation with a spirit! You’ll know the real truth behind why the town was abandoned. I can escort you through one of the houses. If you don’t run away, the International Ghost Hunters Association will give you certificates of courage.” The two girls were goggle-eyed with interest.
“Remember, it’s hush-hush,” he continued. “No one knows about this place but you. If the world knew about it, it would weaken the aura. Nobody realizes the power behind the secrets we’ll learn next weekend. Whatever you do, don’t tell your family or your friends. Make something up feasible enough about where you’re going Saturday. Make it sound real. We have to make sure they won’t call you, interrupt our investigations, or break the invisible connections.” 
“That won’t be a problem,” Rebecca said. “We always go to Daryl’s house on Saturday and work on our science project in the garage. We’ll just tell her we aren’t coming and tell everybody else we are. It’s worth a lie like this. We’ve tried to communicate with the dead with the Ouija Board, and we got no answers. Our séances went nowhere either.”
Nancy and Rebecca had fallen for Clarence’s spiel, hook, line, and sinker. He’d reeled them in, fat and juicy, ready for the frying pan for Billy and Clarence’s dinner.
On his way to science class, Kevin had a problem on his hands. He needed more information. The precog he’d gotten about the event was not enough. There was no other way. He had to go to Ricker Basin.
6:55 PM  Wednesday, May 21st, 1986
Waitsfield, Vermont
Lying on his bed in his grandparents’ house in Waitsfield, Kevin gazed up at the ceiling, hands under his head. He’d asked his grandfather about Ricker Basin and how he could get there. Harold Fielding used to help the fire department and the police with electrical problems, and it hadn’t been hard for him to answer his questions. He used to chat about local history with volunteers at the firehouse years ago. He’d found an ancient map in one of the back offices, and the firemen gave it to him as a present. It certainly delineated where the old town used to be, marking out Little River Road as a road to get back there. Harry gave the map to Kevin.
Thanking his grandfather, he scoured over the old designations. He needed to find another way into Ricker Basin but announcing himself to anyone when he got there. He needed a back door. A dotted line with ‘Harrier’s Loop’ printed under it looked promising. It petered out into the woods on the back side of the town. Harry told him it was an old hunting trail used by trappers. They still used it occasionally. Kevin realized he could get to it from the Interstate.
Kevin power-walked to the garage and started to tune up his quad; it was time to get into gear. Those wild woods were going to be rough and tumble, so his ride must be in shape to handle it.
Skipping out of school early on the day Kevin was going to Ricker Basin, he knew he had to get there and back before dark. Loading the ATV onto the bed of his pick-up truck, he drove to Interstate 89. Glancing at the map on the passenger seat, he began checking the mile markers on the edge of the highway, guessing the correct place to stop. When the numbers on the markers seemed right, he also saw a break in the line of trees. He parked on the shoulder; it had to be the start of Harrier’s Loop! He dropped the tailgate and attached the ramps to the edge of the truck bed. rolling the quad onto the road. He locked the ramps in the truck bed and put his helmet on.
Letting the ATV warm-up, Kevin hit the gas. He jolted between two oak trees and into the woods, squeezing his four-wheeler down an unstable trail like he was threading a needle. Branches snapped off, whipping into his face as he rode through tangles of vines and shrubbery. Slow going. After six miles, the track abruptly ended, and he hid the vehicle under a pile of brush. Still, two miles away from the abandoned town, the forest remained an obstacle. Kevin had been careful, wearing leather pants and a corduroy shirt as armor against the thorns. So far, he’d gotten just one gouge on the back of his hand. Checking his compass, he started moving northwest.
Seeing the Goodall house, he moved quietly towards the building, and his perception of a tragedy to come sharpened with every step he took. Kevin could tell the owner of the house would be in Waterbury for a while, a helpful intuition. He could investigate without interruption.
The front door was unlocked. Kevin stepped into the living room to see a huge oval table on an oriental rug in the center of the room, and six high-back chairs surrounded it. A stone fireplace was on the opposite wall, and there were tall lamps standing in the corners of the room. Heavy olive drapes with gold tassels adorned the windows funereally. The room was obviously ‘staged’ for a séance.
Blood-drenching visions slammed into him with a punch, and Kevin cramped over with the power of this horror. He shook his head and stood up. He had to stop the tragedy, so he had to ignore those images and get back to work.
Scouting out the rest of the house, he ended the tour by taking the wooden stairs to the basement. He stood on the dirt floor and looked at the rickety steps forming a plan. He looked at his wristwatch. It was getting late. Climbing the stairs, he left the building, trotting into the woods to gather logs and branches. He hid them under the back steps and retraced his path back home.
Right after school on Thursday and Friday, Kevin went straight to his grandfather’s workshop in the garage, building devices he’d use to save the girls. There wasn’t a lot of time left.
10:15AM Saturday, May 24, 1986
Ricker Basin, Vermont
Sitting on a bench in front of the shell of a church, Billy and Clarence were excited.
“What time are you meeting them?” Billy asked.
“6:30. I told them the séance will start at eight.”
“We have to go to Montpelier to get the incense and the candles…and the white wine. And we can’t forget the tablecloth either. We’ll escort them into their new world with the necessary atmosphere.”
A chuckle, sounding like a bean fart, erupted out of Clarence. “Escorting them, my ass. We’ll amuse ourselves like cats tossing mice around in the field.” He hadn’t been using his sugar-sweet platitudes to support Leiden’s psychosis as much as he used to.
Billy frowned and hobbled over to his F350, shoulders wrenched tight. He started the engine, and the truck rolled away. Clarence had to run, barely making it, as he opened the passenger door and jumped in. They drove to Montpelier in silence.
11:11AM  Saturday, May 24, 1986
Waitsfield, Vermont  
Kevin’s grandparents had stopped asking about his ‘projects’ a while ago. They watched him pack his truck that morning, fervently praying he’d make it back in one piece. Before he rolled the four-wheeler onto the truck bed, he’d bungee-corded a metal suitcase on an aluminum rack previously installed on the back of the ATV. Then he tossed his backpack into the cab, filled with two sandwiches, four bottles of water, a fleece jacket…and a loaded 45.
Riding through the gnarly trip again, the following two-mile walk was even more difficult. He was hauling the suitcase behind him this time. The case was cumbersome, and the backpack didn’t help, but he knew those tools would let him win the day...or the night. With his gift of the forecast, he knew that Clarence and Billy would not be around when he got there. He needed time to prepare his diversions.
The door was still unlocked. He dragged the suitcase into the center of the living room. Kevin then went outside to get his cache of wood under the back stairs, positioning the pieces on the grate in the fireplace. Taking a minor charge of buffered magnesium out of the suitcase, he inserted it in the center of the logs with the transmitter attached. He drenched the twigs and logs with starter fluid he had in his backpack. Most would evaporate, but a minuscule amount would soak into the kindling. He’d trigger the fire at the perfect moment during the evening. Kevin didn’t think they’d notice the wood, caught up in their plans. Even if they did, he was almost positive they’d think the other one had been responsible. They would ignore it.
Another thing he’d done in his grandfather’s garage was to pour condensed flash powder into flattened bulbs. He took them out of the suitcase and put a few under the standing lamps and another under the reading lamp on the table near the front windows. A three under the brass clock.
Kevin then turned his attention to his small army of speakers with transducers and transmitters. He had brought the creaky old stepladder up from the cellar to install one of those speakers on a ceiling beam above the stairs, another on the mantle behind the clock, and two more behind the lamps. The high moldings around the windows were perfect, and he hid three more behind those thick curtains.
In his finale, he would use a microphone to send his voice out through all those small speakers. Distorting his voice, he would blanket the room with eerie screams and pronouncements to eclipse their own show. If his plan worked, the girls would be so badly frightened they’d run out of the building like lightning, get in their vehicle, and drive away. The murderers would be confused. Too confused to get in their way fast enough to stop them.
Balancing on the backrest of the antique sofa, he installed a video camera in one of the carved wooden scrolls above the living room window. That camera would transmit a picture of the entire room and most of the stairs leading to the second floor to the black and white monitor he’d be watching in the cellar. Jumping off the sofa, Kevin went over everything in his mind. He smiled. Everything was copasetic. Backpack hanging off his shoulder, he grabbed the suitcase handle and bounced down the stairs.
Forty-five minutes later, Clarence and Billy returned from their trip. They didn’t notice the wood in the fireplace, and the living room looked fine.
6:43PM Saturday, May 24, 1986
Ricker Basin, Vermont
Clarence had been waiting on Little River Road. Rebecca and Nancy drove up in Becca’s jeep, and they saw his motorcycle headlight at the intersection.
“Is that you, Clarence?” Rebecca said. He was wearing a helmet. “Should I follow you?”
“Hello, Becky. Yeah, just stay on my taillight. I won’t go too fast.”
He bumped off down the dirt road. Bouncing in their seats, neither of the girls wanted to slow down, too excited to reach the ghost town and have that séance.
The girls thought they were spiritualists. They’d wrapped themselves in a thin gauze printed with multi-colored flowers, wearing eye shadow that sparkled and red lipstick on their lips. The fabric and make-up were supposed to elevate their psychic powers, but in reality, they looked like extras in a cheap X-rated film. At least they’d had the wherewithal to leave their blue jeans and sneakers on under those yards of fabric, knowing they were going into the woods.
They parked in front of Goodall’s house. Nancy and Rebecca looked through the jeep windows to behold Ricker Basin. Lamps glimmered below them on Main Street while electric candles flickered in the windows of the church at the end of that short road. The two young seekers of spiritual truth didn’t think about what the sound of the generators running in a shed two hundred feet away from them meant. There was no power in that group of buildings besides the generators. They did not understand how far from civilization they really were.
Clarence got off the bike and helped them out of the jeep. Escorting them through the front door, the living room glowed in candlelight. A candelabra hung over the oval table, and more candles burned on the mantelpiece and the tables. The embroidered tablecloth Billy had found in a thrift store in Montpelier covered the table, and it had been the perfect choice. The young girls stepped into the living room. Billy was waiting for them. Wearing a dark grey suit, he’d trimmed his goatee and mustache. Limping towards them, he looked devilish but still engaging… for the moment, anyway.
“Good evening, ladies. My name is Mr. Leiden.” He softly shook their hands. It wouldn’t be right to squeeze their virgin hands too hard. “I’m the new owner of Ricker Basin. It’s a delight to meet you. Clarence tells me you want to learn more about the other side…well, I can open a channel for us to communicate with them easily enough.”
The girls looked at him with nervous smiles.
“It’s nice to meet you, Mr. Leiden. I’m Rebecca Lewis.”
Nancy chimed in, “We’re grateful you’ve opened your house up for a séance…oh, my name is Nancy Poole.”
Billy nodded at them. He glanced over at the fireplace, impressed that Clarence had set it up with firewood. Thinking about starting a fire, he changed his mind. Things were rolling along perfectly, and he didn’t want to interrupt that flow.
Clarence took the girls off for a tour of the house. When they were out of sight, Billy hobbled over to the bureau in the corner of the room. He opened the top drawer to reveal a crystal ball on some sheepskin. He took it out and placed the plastic cradle next to it, arranging the ball on the cradle in the center of the table.
Girls in tow, Clarence climbed the stairs to the second floor, rambling over the sordid history of the Goodall family and the calamitous end of the town. He created most of those stories right out of his head as a gifted conversationalist and deceiver, but Rebecca and Nancy listened with concentration. At the end of their tour, they followed him down the back stairs, stopping in front of the cellar door. Clarence’s hand was on the knob, but he actually didn’t turn it. Nancy bumped into him. His thoughts were scrambled for a moment, and he kept on standing there silently. The girls were getting worried. However, things quickly straightened out. He’d intended on taking them down to the cellar, but that intention changed. A statement, ‘I am not going to the basement after all,’ had popped into his head. It seemed to have acted like an order.
Clarence finally opened his mouth, mumbling, “Um…I think…I think it’s getting late. We will get to the living room and start the séance.”
He turned away from the door. He took the short hallway leading into the living room, even has he went back to engaging them with his homilies and forecasts. In his mind, nothing had happened at the cellar door. He hadn’t really changed his mind at all. In a way, he hadn’t. Kevin had.
Getting closer to his captivated audience, he went on, “Spirits are gathering; I can feel them, and they know we’re here. The departed are breathlessly waiting for us to build this bridge. They’ve been forgotten and ignored in the wild woods for way too long. We are finally sending a living handout to them. I know they’ll hold it. I know they’ll connect to us.”
“Is there anything we can do to help open the pathway?” Nancy said.
“Yes. Empty your mind from material thoughts. Allow yourselves to guide your souls to your third eye.” Clarence just kept on going with his flimflam, trying to make it sound like a source from heaven. The girls were still engrossed, following him into the living room as if he were the Pied Piper.
The crystal ball took center stage. Those glassy depths were dragging Rebecca and Nancy in, disappearing in that globe. Billy had covered the cheap plastic holder with a piece of purple velvet as it elevated the orb over five inches above the table. He’d bought the ball and the holder in a yard sale for fifteen dollars. It had turned out to be a steal. A piece of polished glass was a doorway to the afterlife, supporting their careful deceit with flashy ostentation. Billy genteelly pulled two chairs out for them at the table. The teenagers kept on staring at the crystal ball.
Bowing to them, Billy went on. “Powerful waves shall run through in the air tonight,” he said. “We’ll have an exceptional connection. You ladies will be a yin to my yang,” and he, too, sat down.
The night before, alone in his room on the second floor, Billy had been sharpening his knife for hours. It couldn’t get any sharper. He’d kept on with that repeating stroke, skimming the steel edge of the blade up and down the strap, a comfortable counterpoint against his growing anticipation. The final violent solution he and Clarence had been working towards would soon be realized.
Physically close to their host for the first time, Nancy and Rebecca’s anxiety ramped up. Not knowing he had a long knife in his jacket pocket, a primal intuition began ringing a warning bell in their heads …that they ignored. Too jazzed up over their upcoming ‘enlightenment,’ they’d fallen for the commercialization of the unknown, apparently sealing their fate.
Billy pronounced they’d all hold hands. Clarence had found a book in the library in Waterbury loaded with spells and invocations. He’d memorized a plausible gem he’d found in those pages as a plausible incantation to awaken the spirits and supposedly bring them to the séance.
When Clarence was on the other side of the basement door with the girls, Kevin dissuaded him from taking those stairs with a mental barricade. It had worked like a charm. He was still perched on a milk crate, staring at the monitor he had put on a three-legged stool he’d found in the corner of the cellar. His remote control and microphone were on a stair tread, easy to get to. Installing his deceptions in the living room, he’d noticed some fishing line tied to the legs of two of the six chairs and a gavel under the table itself. Kevin chuckled. Nothing but cheap slapstick. His displays were about to overwhelm that silliness. He kept on watching what was happening upstairs. It was important to know when to begin his show.
There’s always a chance his plans would derailed. That was why he had a handgun. He always tried to avoid that dangerous outcome, and it would be unfortunate for Billy and Clarence to face this particular gift of his. Be that as it may, Kevin has used this last-ditch insurance before. And he would do it again if there was no way out.
Billy was impressed by Clarence’s invitation to the lost and, in his mind, spirits he wanted. He thought it might work until his fleeting confidence failed. His many attempts at contacting the departed had been for nought. In reality, they would use blood offerings to reach this goal.
When Clarence’s singsong supplication ended, Billy took full control. “Everyone, unclasp your hands,” putting force in his voice, “Fall into the bottomless sphere…that’s right…look deep, deep inside… yes. Ethan Goodall, are you here with us? Olivia, where are you? Evelyn, Johnny…stop playing and come down here and talk to us.” 
Weeks ago, Clarence told him the first names of everyone in the Goodall family. He had found them in a registry in an office in Waterbury, and Billy had been happy about that. He had more veracity in his séance. Of course, Clarence had not really found a thing. He’d made those monikers up in his head. He didn’t think real or fake names would make any difference in the upcoming blood bath.
“Put your fingertips on the globe…that’s right… leave them there,” Billy went on. “This is our conduit. It’s magnetized. The space between their world and ours is shrinking. We’re getting closer to each other, and soon, we will become one. Aah! I can feel it! They’re connecting.” His voice was already loud, but it suddenly hit an ear-grinding pitch. “You must appear, you must speak to us, tell us what you want. How can we appease you?”
Still no response. Nothing but the wind sighing in the tree branches outside. Billy hadn’t given up yet, no matter what he assumed was going to happen. “We honor your memory and what you lived and died for. We wait for your presence to be revealed.” 
Billy’s eyes were closed. As he swayed back and forth in his chair, two loud knocks rocked the table, and he answered those sounds. “One knock tells us you are Ethan, two Olivia, three Evelyn, and four, Johnny.”
Two knocks. A clear answer. The girls were even more anxious…but they wanted those certificates and the secrets the spirits were about to impart to them. They stayed at the table, fingertips shaking on the crystal ball.
“Ah. It’s good lady of the house,” Billy said. “Get closer to us if you can.”
An empty chair next to Nancy jumped backwards and fell over. Another skittered away from the table.
Billy glanced over at the girls. “Don’t worry. Olivia will tell us what happened to her children. We wait for her answer.”
Clarence began whispering to Rebecca, but he stopped. A distorted hum began throbbing so low it shook the cavities in his teeth. The monotone hum did not affect Billy. He assumed Clarence was responsible for that sound, and his eyes stayed closed as he communicated with the other world.
With a pop, the wood in the fireplace burst into flames. Rebecca and Nancy looked over at the growing fire, eyes wide and mouths agape. The low vibrating sound stopped. Billy opened his eyes. A lamp in the corner of the room fell over with a crash, and the young girls’ nervousness swelled into something more intense.
Billy glared at Clarence, still thinking he was responsible for these new additions. A wail, high in volume, seemed to be coming from the second floor before it screeched down the stairs.
“AAAAAGH….OOOUUUEE.”
The voice bounced against the fireplace before circling the living room. It sounded like a woman was being tortured. The heavy brass clock flew off the mantel and dropped to the floor with a thud, and another standing lamp near the front door fell over. One of its bulbs burst like a firecracker. The howling, now localized in the middle of the room, coalesced into words.
“No…ah…noooooo…aagh.....IT’S TOO LAAATE FOR ME. THEY WON’T p...p...PUUULLLLL MEEE OUT OF THE WELL...AAAAGH!” With the power of a screech owl, the touch of pathos was woven into those garbled words; horror with heartbreak. The out-of-worldly entreaty went on, finally faded away in a soft, shivering wheeze, an adieu from a brutalized soul.
Dread settled in the bellies of the girls like lead, and they pushed away from the table and jumped to their feet. Their sneakers gave them all the traction they needed, and terror boosted adrenaline into their blood. They sprinted across the room like Olympians. Clarence tried to grab Rebecca’s ponytail, but he snatched nothing but thin air. Nancy pulled the front door open, and they ran for the jeep.
Billy was incensed, believing that Clarence was responsible for the over-the-top theatrics. “Bring them back before they drive away, you lunkhead! Go on! Go right now!”
Clarence never heard Billy’s yell. He wasn’t even at the table. He had gone after them as soon as they got and ran. Billy’s attention was suddenly diverting when the back door of the house violently slammed. He heard someone trudging up those rear stairs. A stranger! They must be confronted. His eyes swelled with inhuman savagery. His hip didn’t bother him as he began the short trip to face the interloper …with lethal intent in his heart. He grumbled to himself over what he’d do to anyone interfering with his plans. Moving through the entrance hall, he saw Clarence lying unconscious near the front door. Billy was not interested, believing his partner would deal with his own problems on his own for now.
Nancy had opened the front door with the strength of the damned. It swung into the wall so hard the knob punched into the sheetrock. As they sailed into the night, Nancy hadn’t known she’d anchored the door into the wall, unintentionally leaving it wide open…however, an unknown force had fixed that problem, lifting the doorknob out of the wall. The heavy door closed a second before Clarence got there.
He had opened the door easily enough, but the opening process sped up. The door moved so fast it knocked him off his feet. He lay on his back, arms and legs akimbo. Clarence opened his eyes after a few moments. Getting his bearings, he watched the door sedately close with a conclusive click.
Clarence was livid. He thought Billy had frightened the girls off. Why hadn’t he told him about the extra stuff he had added to the seance? He was now supposed to hunt the bitches down, only to toss him on the floor in his attempt to do so! That was the last straw! Billy can deal with the rest of this himself!
He stood up and shook himself, about to walk out of the house, get on his bike and ride off. But the door was stuck. Clarence’s attempts to open it got more forceful. With both hands on the doorknob, he put a foot on the wall for support. Wrenching even harder, he seemed obsessed with a puzzle that might have been resolved by using a window to leave or perhaps taking the back entrance instead.
Billy reached the backstairs and stared up. He climbed the stairs as fast as he could, speedily enough to see a giant of a man enter his bedroom and close the door behind him. On a warpath, he hobbled and hopped there and opened the door. The stranger was wearing a camouflage jacket and cap, and he held a rifle. He stared down at Billy without expression.
“Who are you, and why are you in my house?” Billy screeched. Ignoring the switchblade in his pocket, he grabbed the handgun in the waistband of his pants and aimed at the behemoth’s left eye. He wasn’t really interested in answers this prowler might give him for his angry questions.
“I have a housewarming present for you,” Billy snarled. “Guess we’ll figure out where you came from after you’re gone.”        
The towering man’s face was the color of raw fish, and his eyes got blacker. Billy Leiden’s threat had triggered a breakneck reaction in his opponent. Dropping the rifle, the trespasser offhandedly slapped Billy’s gun out of his hand, sandwiching him against the wall using his own weight. Billy was a pancake, and the pancake could barely breathe. Short wheezes came out of him while the intruder kept leaning into him like a ton of bricks. Deciding not to suffocate Billy to death, he stood straight, picked up his rifle, and walked out of the bedroom, closing the door behind him.
Billy fell to the floor, suddenly heaving in the air, trying to get his strength back. His gun was inches away. He picked it up. Using all the energy he had left, he got on his knees and shot through the door…twice. He knew he’d been fast enough…the trespasser could not have gotten out of range yet. He waited to hear and even feel the heavy thump when his body hit the floor, but nothing happened. No way he could have missed!
Gage Irving
Toxic Turkey","Toxic Turkey by Gage Irving is a captivating murder mystery blended with paranormal fiction. The story starts with a brief historical account of paranormal manifestations in Ricker Basin, Vermont. We then meet the family of Latham Donnelly, the CEO of a pharmaceutical company. As the story unfolds, we learn that the dignified and affluent façade of the Donnelly household hides secrets and conflicts out of which murder and betrayal plots start emerging. Will the Donnellys survive? For me, a fan of paranormal and cozy murder mysteries, Gage Irving's Toxic Turkey was a thoroughly entertaining, educational, and thought-provoking treat. Entertainment-wise, I liked the atmospheric Thanksgiving setting, the time travel, the suspense, and the psychological portraits of the characters. It was one of those rare stories where evildoers gave good reasons to sympathize with them as the skeletons in their cupboards were unraveling—not that, as a lawyer, I would be able to defend them successfully in a court of law! And the plot twist at the Las Vegas Casino was wonderful! Education-wise, the sinister features of newts and yew tree berries gave me goosebumps—I will always keep my dogs away from them! On the deeper level, I liked how the story portrayed the retribution for avarice and evil. But most of all, I liked the thought-provoking ending with its paranormal aura. I enjoyed every moment of reading Gage Irving’s Toxic Turkey. The only aspect that I felt could be improved was the connection of the Ricker Basin’s history and paranormal manifestations with the Donnelly estate and its residents—the connection that manifested in the story’s climax left me wishing for more. But this is my personal preference and does not justify a rating reduction of this thoroughly enjoyable novel. So, I happily rate it five out of five stars. If you like fast-moving, twisty, and thought-provoking murder mysteries with a touch of paranormal, you will enjoy Gage Irving’s Toxic Turkey!"

PART ONE — HER STYLE
Chapter 1—September 6th, 1972
The night breeze was a welcome sensation after spending six hours working up a sweat cleaning one of the NYU buildings off Washington Square. This seedy side of town always put Melanie on edge. The drenched bandana covering her hair would stay in place until she was safely back in her room. Reaching into her purple bag, she found her keys. Before putting one foot on the sidewalk, she made sure the keys were spread apart and protruding between her fingers.
The walk to the Village Plaza Hotel took as long as smoking one cigarette, three quarters if she was nervous. Three drags in, she heard a low, angry voice. A lighter voice responded as if confused. In the darkness of a doorway off to the left, Melanie could make out a large man hanging over a smaller person.
“Faggot, yer gonna get yer fuckin’ ass kicked,” he growled while raising his massive fist back over his shoulder. It was then that Mel realized the smaller person was a man trying to cover his head with his hands.
Quickly, she stepped toward them. “Honey, where have you been?” she asked, pulling the bandana off her head. The growler, still clenching his fist, turned to look at her. For just a few seconds, he stared at her. Her dirty bell-bottoms and loosely fitting t-shirt covering her slender body did not distract him from the long, curly-cue, strawberry blonde hair that framed her beautiful face and fell to her elbows. With one hand on her hip, she flicked the cigarette to the side. For a fleeting moment, the only sounds were a few crickets communicating with each other. She took that time to smile and step toward him. When she was close enough to see him begin to smile back, her right arm swung around, connecting with his left cheek and eye. The punch itself was not remarkable, but the keys split his face and it had begun to bleed. He lost his balance just enough to allow her to finish the job by kneeing him in the groin. He yelped in pain as he fell over, clutching his crotch. Placing her arm under the light voiced man’s arm, she brought him to his feet.
All he could do was stare at her. Not for her hair and sweet face, but because he was dumbstruck. He’d seen only one other woman fight like that.
Grabbing his hand, they ran down Washington Place. Twice, she looked back to see if the beast was behind them. Tugging him to the right, they ran into the hotel. The man behind the desk in the lobby yelled, “Where are you going?”
“It’s me, Melanie, Mr. Jones.” The three flights of stairs took the last of her energy. Looking back over her shoulder, she felt a little safer. She had not let go of his hand. At times, he’d run right beside her, others ahead of her. They stopped on the third floor. She let go of him and bent over, hands on her knees, trying to catch her breath. With a sweeping motion, she tossed her hair back and stood upright. In front of her darkened doorway, she finally looked over at him. Once her eyes adjusted to the light, she saw his face. In the shadows of a dimly lit bare bulb screwed into the ceiling, she could see his smile. He leaned against the wall with his hand shaking against his chest.
“You’ll be OK,” she tried to say in a calm voice.
His long, dark brown, shiny hair fell in layers just below his shoulders. A pair of Aviator prescription glasses rested on his significant and masculine nose. Eyeliner enhanced his almond-shaped brown eyes and long lashes. Her eyes fell to his mouth, and she couldn’t help but stare at his lips. They were the kind that made women jealous. Both the top and bottom were full. The deep dimples were like perpetual parentheses on the edges of that extraordinary mouth. Once he stood up straight, Melanie guessed he was only a few inches taller than her, putting him at about 5’11”. A bead of blood rolled down over his eyelid.
“Looks like he got a punch in.” She handed him a tissue from her bag, put her blood-covered door key in the worn lock and opened it. He followed her inside.
The kitchen was no more than an area in the otherwise Lilliputian room. She pulled the only chair from the tiny table and motioned for him to sit.
“What’s your name?” she asked as she rinsed off her keys.
“Allen. Shandi.”
She smiled. “Like the beer?”
“No,” he smiled, “as in boisterous.” He looked around the room. It was shabby but clean. Not like anything he’d ever experienced. “And what is your name? I heard you say, ‘Melanie.’”
“Yeah. Melanie. Mel. Foster.”
“As in cultivate?”
“Nah. Like the Grant’s.”
His laugh was light and feminine. Mel pulled a small container from under the twin bed and put it on the threadbare rug next to him. Inside was an assortment of necessities. It contained a sewing needle stuck in a spool of white thread, a hammer, a box of band-aids, a roll of tape, and a small glass container of hydrogen peroxide. She retrieved a band-aid and the bottle.
“Would you take off your glasses, please?”
“Truth be told, my vision is horrible. I can only see about a foot in front of me without them,” he told her.
“I’d like to clean out that cut. That bastard was filthy. It wouldn’t surprise me if you caught something just by breathing in the same space as that creep did. Your glasses could use a wipe, too.” He removed them and tilted his head towards her. “This might sting a bit,” Mel warned. She lifted his thick hair away from his forehead. The aroma of pot and sandalwood floated up to her and it made her smile. She lightly patted his head with a paper towel with the tiniest bit of hydrogen peroxide.
“Jesus!” He winced.
“I’m sorry,” she said, and blew on the cut.
“I haven’t thanked you for saving me from that Neanderthal. What would ever make you go after something that size?”
She paused. “The ‘f’ word.”
“Fuck?”
“Faggot.” The very word made her purse her lips. “May I have your glasses?” She took them, gave them a quick cleaning on her shirt, and held them out to him.
He reached for her hand holding the paper towel, but she quickly pulled away. He was startled by her reaction. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean anything by it,” he said. “I should go. Thank you for your care and time.” He put his glasses back on, then got up and walked to the door.
She was still holding the bloodied paper towel as he closed the door behind him. Her head fell back. “Oh, good Christ,” she said, disappointed in herself. “Let it go!” she whispered.
Once she’d quickly washed the dirty coffee cup from that morning and rinsed herself off in front of the sink, she fell onto the bed. The sounds of New York City outside her window had finally become familiar to her. That was not what kept her from relaxing. The image of his face kept returning to her. Allen was beautiful. He’s gay. She punched her pillow in hopes of making it more comfortable and closed her eyes. Tomorrow is Saturday. She began a mental list of things to do. Things like laundry and groceries and such needed to be done. But then, she heard his laugh in her head. Her eyes opened, and she sighed. There will not be much in the way of sleep tonight. “Happy birthday to me,” she whispered.
Chapter 2
It was nearly noon when she opened her eyes. A light knock on the door startled her. She jumped out of bed and put on her robe.
“Who’s there?”
“I have a delivery for Miss Grant,” a deep voice said.
“Miss Grant?” she whispered, and then it clicked. “Hold on.” Grabbing her bag off the floor, she searched inside until she found a quarter at the bottom. Pulling the door open just a crack, she could see an enormous assortment of purple and white flowers. She opened it wide enough to take them. Slowly, the bouquet lowered, and Allen’s eyes came into view. He playfully batted them at her.
She laughed. “What’s this?”
“It’s just a modest gift in appreciation of your bravery. Also…” He handed her a large, beautifully wrapped box. She took it from him.
“Come on in, please. You didn’t have to do this.”
He placed the flowers on the tiny table, then turned to her. After adjusting his glasses against his nose, Allen stood with his hands behind his back. His skin-tight, shiny black jeans flared out into a modest bell. The shoes looked like women’s leather square-toed chunky-heeled pumps, but he made them look great. The tan tank top was sheer enough that the hair on his chest and the outline of his nipples were evident. Around his neck he wore a slender black leather tie that was loosened and hung low on his chest. The knot itself was strange. A black silk scarf was wrapped several times around his left wrist and tied, leaving the ends hanging about six inches.
She sat on the bed, pulled off the wrapping, and lifted the lid. Inside was a proper first aid kit, a sewing kit complete with scissors, and a few smaller tools complete with two kinds of screwdrivers, a tape measure, pliers and an adjustable wrench.
“This is too much!”
He sat near her and took out an ‘L’ shaped piece of metal and examined it. “What is this?”
“It’s an Allen wrench,” she laughed. His smile disappeared, and he placed it back in the box. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to….” Tentatively, she patted his shoulder and rose from the bed. “Would you like a cup of coffee? All I have is instant.” She clutched her robe at the neck and started to open one of the two cabinets.
“I was hoping I could take you out for a bite. It’s a lovely day. We could walk a bit if you’d like.” Mel did not answer. “We could take a cab if you prefer.”
“I…I don’t have any clean clothes. Today is laundry day for me. Can I take a raincheck?” she finally asked, not meeting his eye as her face reddened.
“Well, this is all too perfect! How long will it take for you to put on whatever you would have worn to the laundromat? In 15 minutes, I’ll have a cab out front, alright?”
“I don’t…”
“Please?” He held out his hand. She looked down, smiled and swatted her fingertips with his.
“Alright, then. Meet me outside in fifteen minutes,” Allen said with a smile. Just before he closed the door, he looked back at her, flashed that incredible smile again, and gave a quick nod in a way that somehow relaxed any of her suspicious feelings.
She lifted a pair of hip huggers from the top of a pile of clothes in her closet and shook them out. Her only clean shirt was a lilac sleeveless turtleneck her brother made for her. She brushed her teeth with one hand and ran her fingers through her thick hair with the other. Laying out two pieces of bread on the counter, she assembled a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. She rinsed out the paper coffee cup she’d saved from the day before and filled it with milk. The lid still fit. There were far too many beautiful flowers in her bouquet not to share. She chose three cosmoses, cut the stems, and set them in a little water-filled jelly jar. Splashing water on her face, she looked at her reflection in the aged mirror on the wall. As ready as I’ll ever be. Taking a deep breath, Melanie slung her bag over her shoulder. She tried to walk calmly down the three flights of stairs.
Through the dirty front door window, she could see Allen leaning on a cab, chatting with the driver. Just then, a tall blonde man walked by them. Both heads swiveled, taking a long look at his ass. She had to chuckle.
“I’d check that out myself,” she whispered.
The day was quite a bit cooler than the day before. Allen took a cigarette from his pocket, along with a gold lighter. As he lit up, he saw Melanie walking toward him. She turned to the homeless man sitting up against the building. “Fred, here’s a little something to eat. Would you save me the glass?” He reached out for the paper bag and cup. With his free hand, he took hers and kissed it. Mumbling something unintelligible to her, she smiled and gave him the flowers.
He placed them up against his leg, cupped his hand around the glass and admired his gift.
A breeze drifted down the street. Melanie’s nipples shriveled from the cold air. Her knee-jerk reaction was to draw her arms up to her chest. Allen noticed and immediately felt embarrassed for her.
A policeman walked by them and stopped to observe Allen. He grabbed Mel’s hand, opened the door to the cab, and helped her in. Walking to the other side, Allen kept an eye on him. He tipped an imaginary cap to the officer and climbed inside. “Broome and Mercer,” he directed and turned to her. “You are adorable!” he said, smiling at Mel. The cabbie stared at him through the rearview mirror.
“Where were you coming from last night?” he asked her.
“My job. I didn’t ask you how your head is.”
He smiled. “It’s fine. Where do you work?”
“In the evenings, I clean some of the buildings at NYU.” She lifted his hair away from the cut. Clicking her tongue at the sight of the half dollar sized bruise developing, she asked, “Did you ice this?”
“No. How old are you?”
“20. And you?”
“24. Where are you from originally?”
“Upstate New York. A tiny town no one’s ever heard of.”
“Is that where you learned to fight?” he asked with a smile.
The color seemed to drain from her face. A silence hung between them until the cab hit a pothole that sent them both leaning hard to the right. She caught Allen as he fell against her.
Her loud, nervous laugh made its debut, and it certainly could draw attention.
“Oh my! Well, I love that sound!” he said.
The cab pulled over and made a hard stop. “Broome and Mercer, Mr. Shandi.” Allen’s tight pants forced him to lean to the left awkwardly. Jamming his right hand in his front pocket, he retrieved a bundle of bills. Mel glanced down at his hands. The bulge to the left of the bottom of his zipper caught her off guard. She very quickly looked away. He gave the cabbie a $5 tip.
“Thank you, Mr. Shandi!” His hand began to tremble as he put his money away. She took notice, and he caught that. He exited, went to her side of the cab and opened the door. Offering her his left hand, he helped her climb out.
“Are you hungry? I’m hungry. Let’s get lunch. My treat,” he said, looking across the street. He grabbed her hand and they sprinted through the traffic. Horns began honking, and a few cars stopped short. He held his hand up in a thanks gesture. She loved the way his hair bounced as he trotted. They entered a narrow eatery. A decidedly gay man welcomed Allen.
“Mr. Shandi, it’s so good to see you again. Your table is ready.” Other couples that had been waiting were not regulars or did not carry the same weight as Allen. She did not know what to make of this.
They were seated across from one another in a dark and quiet corner. Paper menus were brought to the table by a pretty young lady. “What can I get you to drink, Mr. Shandi?” she asked in a coquettish manner. She reached past Melanie’s face to light the candle and replaced the dirty ashtray with a clean one.
“What would you like, Mel?”
No one had called her that in at least five years.
“Coffee please, with milk?” she asked, looking at the waitress.
“I’ll have the same.”
The waitress placed her hand on his shoulder and said, “You’ve got it, Honey.” She walked away with quite a sway in her hips. Mel grinned and looked over to see Allen reaching for her over the table. He took a lock of her curly hair and rolled it between his fingers.
“If mermaids were real, this is the kind of hair they would have.”
She laughed as her face turned red. “Wow. I’ve never heard that before.” The art that was curiously placed up against the wall caught her eye. One piece in particular stood out. “Take a peek at that one! It’s a kaleidoscope!” She turned her attention back to his face. He’d been staring at her. Feeling embarrassed, she pretended to go over the menu. “Where are you from?” Mel asked.
“I’m not an interesting person,” he said while lighting a cigarette. “Would you like one?” he offered.
“No, thanks. I don’t want to hear your deepest, darkest secrets. How about, what do you do for a living? I feel like I’m the only one not in on it. Everybody knows you. I’ve lived here for five months, and I have no idea what you do or why you are so,” she paused, “beloved.”
“Beloved. That’s interesting.” He propped up his elbow on the table, and he rested his chin in his hand. The smoke from his cigarette curled up around his face. She sat back in the chair and crossed her ankle over her knee. Lacing her fingers together, she rested her hands in her lap. Giving him an “I’ve got all day” look, she took a deep breath.
Tapping his cigarette on the ashtray, he asked, “Have you ever heard of a clothing line called ‘Cleo’?”
“Yes. Do you work for her?”
“Well, I am her, so to speak. I named it after a knot I created for a necktie.” He pointed to the one that hung from his neck. It almost appeared to be a braid, and yet it was not. “The business has been open for three and a half years. It was perfect timing for my vision of what young women wanted. And the rest as they say…” he laughed, waving his cigarette in the air.
The waitress returned with the coffee. “Have you decided what you’d like to eat?” she asked, staring directly at Allen.
“Not really. Can we have a few more minutes?”
“Sure, Honey,” she answered and sashayed away, stopping once to look over her shoulder at Allen. But his thoughts were elsewhere.
“Have you always known you were…a visionary?” Mel asked as she stirred her coffee.
Allen glanced around to see if anyone was within earshot. He whispered, “What exactly are you asking?”
“My brother made this top for me. Not really my style, but he made it with love.” She gently touched the gauzy fabric around her neck. “Ben knew he was gay from the time he was a little boy,” Mel said softly. Her eyes welled up. “My mother simply ignored that fact. My father had an altogether different take on Ben. The things he would punish him for, well, it would just break your heart. That bastard took off in 1965. Good riddance.”
“Where is Ben now?”
“Buried in the Oswegatchie Cemetery outside of Fine, NY. Fine, NY! Funny, huh?” she laughed to cover the sadness.
More customers had begun to fill the place. The waitress returned once more. “What will it be?” she asked.
“Mel?” he asked.
She kept her head down and asked, “May I have a burger?” A tear rolled down her nose and fell on the menu.
“I’ll have the same,” he said. The waitress jotted it down as she walked away.
He gave Mel his napkin. “Dry your eyes, Sweetness,” then moved to a chair next to her and put his arm around her shoulders. “There are souls that are just too beautiful for this world,” he whispered in her ear. She had thought the very same thing a thousand times.
Two gay teens cautiously approached the table. Mel looked up. “Your fans, Mr. S! If you’ll excuse me…” The young men nearly levitated over a chance to chat with Allen. He watched her walk through a narrow doorway and into the restroom.
Splashing a little water on her face, she looked at her reflection. Her hands gripped the sides of the sink. “Pull it together,” she whispered to herself. Once she’d collected herself with a few deep breaths, she headed back to the table. She stopped and watched Allen as he spoke to them. He listened carefully as they replied and talked about their dreams.
Allen was leaning forward, elbows on his knees and speaking softly. He was incredibly patient as he explained what it took to get where he was. His enormous smile was evidence that he seemed to enjoy this part of his celebrity.
She leaned against the door frame, legs crossed at the ankles, her arms crossed just below her chest.
The two teens stood close to each other. For a second, their pinkies hooked together. Allen grinned. Removing the scarf from his wrist, he tied it around the wrist of the young man on the left, then lifted the tie from his neck and put it on the other fan. He held out his hand to shake theirs.
An older couple seated at a nearby table shook their heads in disapproval. Mel stood and stared at them for a moment, then turned her back and obstructed their view. The boys practically pogoed over to her.
“Johnny, isn’t he amazing?” the shorter of the two asked his boyfriend.
He grinned at Mel and said, “He’s amazing!”
“He certainly is,” she replied. The boys left overwhelmed with joy about what had just happened.
The burgers arrived at the table as Mel sat back down. “Thank you,” she said to the waitress and tried to make eye contact.
Finally, she looked at Mel and said, “You’re welcome.”
“Those kids will be living on that for a long time. That’s just about the sweetest thing I have ever seen,” she told him.
“I could say that about what you did for the guy sitting in front of your building earlier, but I won’t. Mine was sweeter.”
Her laugh reached the customers near the front door. “Sorry,” she said, covering her mouth, trying to muffle the sound. “You are a brat!”
“The boys’ names are Jon and Johnny. Isn’t that sweet? They’re hoping to open a clothing store in the village.” As he set his coffee cup on the saucer, his hand trembled again, rattling both. “Don’t ever apologize for your laugh. I like people that let their emotions out. I’d hate to think what would happen if you tried to hold that inside. It could be catastrophic! Your eyes and brain would be scattered everywhere!” he nearly shrilled, while his hand swiped through the air as if he were carrying a tray of filled coffee cups.
She was about to ask him about his hand, but he stood, excused himself, and headed toward the restroom. His hand, his life. It was quite simply none of her business.
When he returned, they continued to talk for another hour or so. Allen had participated in the Stonewall riots and Mel wanted to learn about every scrap of it.
“I witnessed the woman, Storme DeLarverie, fighting the cops. Some aren’t sure it was her, but I’m convinced it was. When she yelled out to us, ‘Why don’t you guys do something?’ we all went crazy. I guess we all have a boiling point.”
“Truer words, my friend. Ben wanted so much to be a part of it. He never hid who he was. All he ever wanted was to work for, well, someone exactly like you. Damn, you would have loved him,” she said, leaning back in her chair.
“The mob and the cops were involved in the whole thing. Talk about an uphill battle. At that time, the lesbians, queens and gays were not exactly a team.”
“Really? You’d think people treating all of you like dirt would be enough to pull everyone together,” she said.
“Well, to be fair, I’ve seen the same sort of division in the women’s movement.”
“You’re right.” She paused and said, “Things are going to change. They’ve got to. We have no control over who we fall in love with.” She lit one of the two cigarettes she had left. “Would you like one?” she offered. He waved it off. “Do you have somebody special in your life?” she asked.
“Yes, I do. A man named Christopher.” Allen’s eyes lit up.
“How did you meet?”
“Everyone thinks we met at a fashion show. We met while waiting for a cab. Long story short, we ended up sharing one and kept on sharing.”
“How long are the two of you together?”
“Almost a year,” he answered with a smile.
“How did you know it was love?”
“Oh, good Lord. How does anyone ever truly know? I wish I could say that it was love at first sight. Like a bolt of lightning jabbing me in the heart and I would never be the same. I think that’s bull. It never happens that way. How about you? Is there someone special?”
“No,” she said, stood and tossed her bag over her shoulder. She sighed as she thought about the bill. “I don’t even have enough money for a decent tip. I promise I will pay you back.” As she passed the kaleidoscope painting, she stopped to take a closer look but gasped when she saw the price.
He stood and tossed a few bills on the table. As he passed the waitress, he shoved a few additional bills into her pocket. “Thank you, dear.” She smiled at him, then continued to pour coffee into another young man’s cup, flirting away with her latest customer.
It felt good to have something substantial in her stomach for a change. As they left the eatery and headed north, a sophisticated man walked toward them. His Dobermann ignored the noises around him. “Geeze. Check out this beautiful beast,” she gushed. “Excuse me. May I pet him?” she asked the gentleman.
“He can be skittish,” he replied.
Mel held her hand out palm down. She let the dog take its time sniffing, and then she turned her hand over. He began to lick her fingers.
“Well, I’ll be,” said the man.
“My trick is to let them smell me when I just finished eating,” she joked. The gentleman chuckled as he and his pet went on with their walk.
“You like dogs?” Allen asked.
“To be honest, I love them. Dogs are such wonderful creatures. They love you no matter what. That’s hard to find.”
“Let me get a cab.” There were none in sight. While they waited at the curb, a policeman began to cross the street and headed toward them. Allen shoved his hand into his pockets and quietly asked, “Would you take my arm?”
Mel did not realize what was happening but did what he had asked. It was then that she noticed the officer. Mel laid her head on his shoulder and focused her gaze on a couple window shopping across the street. Once he had passed, she removed her arm from his. “I hate that fucking shit,” she hissed. Allen looked down at her face. Her eyes were blazing. He waved down an approaching cab, and they piled in.
“You can’t let it get to you,” he said in a matter-of fact kind of way. He turned his attention to the cabbie and said, “West Central Park and 69th.” This time, she accepted when he offered a cigarette.
Pulling her hair back, she leaned into the lighter’s flame. She sighed. “I’m not able to pay for anything, and it’s driving me nuts. I’m embarrassed,” and sighed again. “As soon as I…”
“Later, OK?” he asked and patted her hand.
She could not help but look up at all the high-reaching buildings that stood in Manhattan. “I can never get over just how immense this place is.” Her head was just about upside down, trying to get the best possible view.
“Yes. You are adorable.” She didn’t hear him. The city and all its energy had her full attention. Allen turned to the gorgeous driver. When they arrived at his address, the cabbie thanked Allen for the tip. He also handed him a slip of paper with his name and number on it.
Allen just smiled and put it in his pocket.
A uniformed doorman held open the heavy glass door. “Good afternoon, Mr. Shandi.”
“Hey there, George. How are Christina and the baby?”
“They are wonderful, thanks for asking.”
“Come on. You must have a picture, yes?”
With that, George pulled his wallet out of his pocket and opened it to a photo.
“Oh,” Allen said with a sigh. “Oh my gosh. They are lovely. Is Penelope about four months old now? Look at these beautiful women, Mel.”
She took the wallet. The woman in the photo looked thrilled to be a mom. Little Penelope’s toothless grin was precious. “You are a very lucky man,” she said placing her hand on her abdomen. Still smiling, she handed it back to him.
“Yes, I am.” George took a few seconds to look at the picture before putting it away.
“By the way, Christopher has taken Daphne for a walk.”
Allen gave him a wink. “Thanks, George.”
The elevator required a unique key to go to the penthouse. Mel and Allen rode it nine floors up. When the elevator doors opened, they stepped into a small area with a large door across the way. He opened it and they entered an extravagant vestibule. Mel had never seen or could even imagine such wealth. An older gentleman greeted Allen with his mail and messages.
He looked inquisitively at Melanie.
Allen said, “This is my sweet friend, Melanie. Mel, this is Quinten. If you need or want anything, this is your man.”
Mel extended her hand out to Quinten and said, “Nice to meet you.” He hesitated and looked at Allen. Allen grinned.
He took her hand and said, “It’s very nice to meet you. Would you prefer Mel or Melanie?”
“Either is fine. May I use the bathroom?”
“Of course, follow me, please.”
The bathroom was straight ahead and to the right. It was below a winding staircase with full bookshelves. Quinten lightly pressed the spine of a red and black book, and a door opened outward. Orange-yellow light spilled out onto the tiled floor.
“I’ve never actually seen a secret door. Very cool! Thank you,” she said and went inside. The dominant color was red, and the accent colors were black, gold and purple. Tiles of red with gold swirls outlined in black covered the bottom half of the walls. The upper half was crimson. She was sure the entire room was larger than her apartment. There were several black and red velvet ottomans and a purple and gold chaise lounge in a sitting area. On the other side of a half wall was the toilet and a bidet alongside it. Over the double sinks hung an enormous mirror with an ornate frame. She set her bag on the black marble counter between the sinks. As she sat on the toilet, she tried to take all of it in. “And this is just the bathroom,” she whispered. Once she’d finished, she washed her hands and raked her fingers through her hair.
Allen was waiting for her. “I’d like to show you something.” They went up the stairs and off to the left. After passing several rooms, Allen held open the door to a bedroom. She flashed him a confused expression.
“Oh! No. This isn’t one of those ‘I’d like to show you my etchings’ snares. I wanted to show you a few things from my collection. It’s through the doorway on the left.”
She did not budge. “Wait here,” he said and disappeared into that room. As he came back, he draped pieces of clothing on hangers across the bed. Spreading them out, he chose a backless sequin-covered halter top jumpsuit in champagne gold. “Isn’t this scrumptious?”
“It’s dazzling. But it’s not my style.”
He looked at the remainder of what was on the bed. “That’s the second time you’ve mentioned your style. What is your style, exactly?”
“I like a less feminine look, you know? I’ve always been a tomboy,” she said timidly. “Do you design things for men?”
The sound of quickly clicking toenails on the wood floor grew louder. With that, a magnificent Rottweiler burst into the room. “Daphne-love!” gushed Allen.
Catching his breath, Christopher followed. He stood over six feet tall, blonde hair parted on the right and trimmed with precision. Although he was slender, he was muscular the way 20-year-old men often are. “I’m back from our daily tug. She is going to pull my arm out one of these days,” he said.
Daphne’s interest shifted to the new scent in the room. Her full tail swished back and forth as she sniffed Mel’s feet and legs.
“Who is this?” Christopher asked, inspecting Mel.
She stuck out her hand, “I’m Mel Foster.” He hesitated for a moment, then took her hand. “It’s very nice to meet you,” she said. Still looking at Christopher, she asked, “Daphne’s tail is intact? I don’t think I’ve ever seen that. She’s a beauty.”
“We got her when she was a pup, and we specifically told them not to do that. It’s unthinkable,” Allen huffed.
Mel was on her knees, along with Christopher, cuddling and scratching her belly. “We had a large dog when I was little. Just a mutt, but at least 100 pounds. My father found a harness for her and it helped when we had to walk her.” Daphne jumped onto Mel knocking her back with her legs folded under her and began licking her face. Mel laughed and hugged her around the neck.
“Daphne!” Allen laughed. “Come! Come here, my girl.” She obediently went to his side.
“May I have a washcloth or something?” Mel asked once Allen had lured Daphne away.
Christopher answered, “Sure.” Mel followed him out of the bedroom and down the hall.
“Second door on the left,” he said with a forced smile.
She pushed the door, but it did not close all the way. Splashing her face with warm soap and water removed the drool from her face. Two black velvet ottomans placed side by side with a tiny table between were in the corner. She sat and took advantage of the small, crystal ashtray. Digging through her bag, she retrieved her last cigarette, matches and a hair clip. Taking a deep drag, she grabbed everything and went to the mirror. With the cigarette hanging from her mouth, she pulled her thick hair and piled it on the crown of her head. The extra-large leather slide barely fit over her mop of curls. She pushed the stick through the holes to secure everything in place. Invariably, five or six tendrils hung down around her neck, dripping down over her back and shoulders. She could hear a discussion growing louder coming from the bedroom. “She will end up becoming just another fag-hag for you. What is this, the fifth? I do not need yet another person hanging around watching us as if you and I were a freakshow,” Christopher said firmly.
“You are wrong about her. She’s one of us. Her ideas about women’s clothing are perfect for what’s down the road,” said Allen.
“Is that how you met her?” There was a pause.
Trying to make her presence known, Mel tugged the door open and stomped heavily onto the floor. Daphne flounced toward her. “I’m going to have to get going, little girl.” Holding either side of her enormous head, she kissed her loudly.
“Your hair. I love it!” declared Allen. “I have a proposal for you, Mel. You brought up a more masculine feel for women’s clothing. Would you help me bring that idea to life?” Allen asked.
“I don’t know the first thing about fashion.”
Christopher laughed, “You’ve got that right.”
“Now, now. Let’s not be bitchy,” said Allen.
Mel motioned toward Christopher while looking at Allen and said, “He understands that I do not…”
“Sometimes, all you need to know is what you like and what you don’t like,” said Allen. “Like art.” He grabbed her hand and led her to the back of the bedroom. After opening the double-door walk-in closet, he began to look through his clothes. He chose a white button-down shirt from his closet. “What would you do with this?” He held it out to her. His right arm was across his chest and was clutching his left bicep. His forearm extended outward with the palm of his hand facing the ceiling, and the shirt dangled from his fingertip. She would come to know this as his “What say you?” pose.
“Seriously?” She exhaled. Taking the shirt from him, she hung it from an indentation on one of the columns of the four-poster bed. Christopher gasped at the thought of damage done to the tiger maple column. “I would make it sleeveless and shorten the front to waist length.” She turned it around. Christopher stepped in and held it for her. “Thanks, Christopher. It could be darted a bit to fit my form, then lengthened the shirttail to fall just passed the…” she patted her rear.
“Ass?” Christopher asked. Allen gave him a look.
“Well, I was gonna say cheeks, but either fit. Split it up the middle to about two inches below the waistline. It would end up kind of like tails on a tux. If you could give it lapels rather than a collar, I think that would be something I’d like.”
“What would you wear with it?” asked Allen.
Taking a moment to think, she finally said, “I would wear straight leg jeans and man boots up to my knees. You know, the kind that you tie up in the front without the spiky heels.”
Allen looked over at Christopher and said, “Do you see what I mean?”
“Do you design clothes also, Christopher?”
He seemed insulted by the question. “I am a model,” he answered in a sharp tone.
“I’m sorry. I don’t read many magazines.” Pointing out her appearance with gesturing hands, she laughed, “Just look at me for crying out loud!”
“I have to give you that,” Christopher said.
“Honey, that’s not…” Allen started to say.
“But it’s funny and appropriate,” answered Mel. “Allen, thanks for all of this. I’ve got to get going.”
A nearly palpable look went from Allen to Christopher. Christopher shrugged his shoulders and said, “OK,” and he left the room.
“This might be forward, but I…we wondered if you would consider staying with us while we take Cleo in this new direction? This place has several empty rooms. But I think you’d truly love the one on the far end.”
“But I haven’t agreed to the clothing thing.”
He ignored her. She followed him to an enormous room down the hallway. Daphne’s toenails let them know she was right behind them. Everything was covered with sheets except the king-size bed. Sliding glass doors on the far side of the room led to a balcony complete with greenery and furniture. The walls were white, and the furniture was in varying shades of red. As the sun fell low in the sky, it cast a fantastic orangey-pink over everything around her, including Allen.
“Isn’t it gorgeous?”
“Yes, but I have a job,” she said.
He came toward her and held her by the shoulders. “This is an opportunity to grow. It will be your job. Name your price.” She was only aware of his hands on her. Everything else was a blur. “Please?” he asked, batting his eyes again. Allen bent down a bit to meet her eye and was inches from her face. “I need you.”
She paused, then finally said, “Yes. Thank you. Allen, I am so grateful…” but the lump in her throat and tears squelched her ability to speak.
Allen threw his arms around her and she pulled away just a bit. He laughed and said, “I’m sorry. I excite easily!”
“Good to know,” she said, patting him on the back. He laughed into her ear. The sensation of his breath on her neck was incredible and alarming at once. “I have one request.”
“Name it.”
She pulled back and placed her hands on his chest. “I am not a huggee, cuddly, touchy-feely person. Please, don’t take it the wrong way. You are such a great guy, a real gentleman. You would never deliberately hurt anyone. It just makes me uncomfortable.”
He looked into her eyes. “Of course, I can respect that.” He backed away. “I understand, you know. Maybe better than most. I was different, too.” She felt light-headed.
“Are you alright?” he asked.
“Yes. I think I need a shower and a good night’s sleep.”
“Can I have Quinten bring you a bite to eat?”
“No, not right now. If I get hungry, I’ll poke around the kitchen, if that’s OK.”
“It’s fine with me, but Quinten gets a bit touchy when his domain is disturbed.”
“I promise I’ll clean up after myself,” she offered.
“Good Lord, woman, I was joking! Feel free to have anything you’d like.” He left her room and closed the door behind him.
Chapter 3
By the next morning, all of Mel’s belongings had been picked up and delivered to the penthouse. That afternoon, Allen purchased a month’s worth of clothing for her right down to her panties, along with a carton of her favorite cigarettes plus several joints. She sat on the edge of the bed surrounded by all of it, including the jelly jar she’d given to Fred and her prized possession. It was an old lockbox. Taking the key out of her bag, she placed the box on her lap and opened it slowly. Lifting the three photographs of her brother, Benjamin, from inside, she traced his face with her finger. It also contained a spool of fishing line. She looked up to see Allen standing in the doorway. She closed the box and set it aside.
“Would you like a hand putting things away?” he asked.
“I can’t accept all of this.”
“Consider it an advance,” he said. “Anything you dislike will be returned, exchanged, whatever.” He walked toward her.
Mel stood and moved toward the middle of the room. “You could have let my friend keep the glass,” she remarked.
“I did something a little better, I think. I hope you agree. Fred now occupies your old apartment, and I’ve paid up for two years. He has several new outfits, a bit of cash, and will be filling in at your old job until you decide what you want to do. I will find another place for you to live if you think this isn’t working out, but I want you to share your ideas with me,” he said in a serious tone.
She turned away from him. “I’m going to do my very best for you. Thank you for giving me this chance.”
He moved toward her, then thought better of it. Quinten knocked on the door frame.
“Excuse me, Sir. How many for dinner tonight?”
“Six, I think. Very casual, OK?” Allen asked.
“Time?”
“Six-thirty.”
“Is there anything, in particular, you would like tonight, Sir?”
“Mel, if you sat down in a restaurant and could have anything you wanted, what would it be?” Allen asked her.
She chuckled. “I feel as if I’m in a dream, or I’m high. Maybe I’ve died and gone to Heaven.” She asked timidly, “Do you like spaghetti and meatballs and maybe a salad?”
“Perfect. Is that doable, Quinten?”
“Of course, Sir. Can I get you anything in the meantime, Miss Melanie?”
“No thanks, and for God’s sake, drop the Miss. You make me feel as if I’m the character in ‘Gone with the Wind’! Or worse, my mother.”
“Quinten, could you give us a minute?”
“Of course,” he said and went downstairs.
Allen sat on the bench at the foot of the bed. His legs crossed at the knee and leaning back on his hands. “Did I tell you how I ended up living here?” he asked Mel. She shook her head, no. He gestured with his hand for her to sit next to him. She sat beside him with her legs apart, her elbows resting on her thighs and hands folded. He brushed her hair over her shoulder.
“I just want to see your face, OK?”
“Yes,” she answered and looked at him.
“My father owned an oil conglomerate. It doesn’t matter which one. They are all greed-factories. He could buy and sell God, or so he said. The best part is that God got the last laugh. One morning he told his secretary that there were to be no phone calls, no interruptions. He had a massive heart attack at his desk while she typed away just outside his door. Side note, she was also his mistress. An hour and a half later, she poked her head in to ask a question. She found him sweat-soaked and face down in a pool of his vomit. The Man upstairs is a funny guy, don’t you agree?”
“I gather you were not close to him?”
“No one was. My father loved money and fucking women. If he could have figured out a way to bang them with a roll of hundreds on his cock, it would have been his ejaculation of a lifetime.”
“Wow,” she chuckled. “How did your mom take it?”
“Poor thing, she loved him and not for his money. She would tell me about the 19-year-old boy she’d met all those years ago. Generous, kind, hardworking and very gentle with her. Somewhere along the line, he soured. He began drinking to excess and worse, hitting her. He became ruthless.”
“Did he know you are gay?”
“I think if he’d spent just a bit of time with me, he would have. But you must be in the same room with a person, look into their eyes, listen to what they say to learn anything. My wonderful mother died two years after my father. Countless homes, cars, all kinds of ‘things’ had become the property of my brother and me. Did I tell you I have a brother? Keith. Funny guy. A good man. Anyway. He and I sold most of it and gave the money to charities for the homeless, hospitals, but the best was handing out money to anyone that looked like they could use it. We knew this would make the old bastard roll in his grave. Even better, we made the donations in his name.”
“Ooooh, you scoundrels. I love it,” she laughed.
“Quinten has been with our family since before I was born. He is an old-fashioned gentleman’s gentleman. He just can’t help himself. I know for certain there were times that he would intercept when that bastard was after my mom. He’d lie and say there was a phone call or news on TV about my father’s company. My father was so drunk he probably could have distracted him with a ring of keys, …like an infant. All that being said, Quinten is who he is, and we accept him that way. Alright?”
Her face was beet red. “Yes. Understood. I’ll make it right.” She looked back on the bed and asked, “I hate to sound like such a girl, but what are you wearing tonight?”
Allen laughed. “How do jeans and a shirt sound? Shoes are optional.”
“Comfortable, thank you.”
Allen’s chef, Wyatt Edmonds, had taken the time to ask Mel about her selection for dinner, right down to the amount of garlic or basil. He stood at six foot four and two hundred forty pounds of muscle. He looked extremely intimidating, but that turned out to be completely wrong. He was a gentle and soft-spoken man. It was moving to see his interest in what would make her happy.
That evening, softly playing jazz hung in the background. Allen and Christopher were in one of two black loveseats in a cozy area of the living room. The other loveseat was directly across from them, with two red high-back chairs between them facing the fireplace. A black lacquered coffee table sat between it all.
The first to arrive were two women that worked in the garment district. Eric had red cropped hair and was wearing a man’s blue button-down shirt tucked into her black jeans with a matching blue belt and sneakers.
Mel asked Eric, “May I ask, do you consider yourself a ‘he’ or ‘she’?”
“He, and thank you for asking.” His girlfriend, Meghan also had red hair, but shoulder length. She wore a short denim skirt, a red sweater and black high heels. After the introductions, Allen offered drinks. Eric would have his usual Pabst Blue Ribbon beer in a pint glass while Meghan preferred white wine. Rather than help, Christopher called out for a vodka and tonic. As Allen gave Eric and Meghan their drinks, he heard the elevator door open and excused himself. Mel went to the bar to make Christopher’s drink. She brought it to him and asked, “What do you think Allen will have?”
“I have no idea,” he answered, not meeting her eyes.
“Mel, meet Zora Preston. She is a buyer for one of the high-end stores on 5th Avenue. Zora, Mel Foster.”
She was a tall, curvy African American woman with a beautiful, giant Afro. She wore a tight-fitting, sleeveless black turtleneck sweater, large gold hoop earrings and a floor-length striped skirt in all the colors of the rainbow. Mel smiled and shook her hand. “Do you prefer Mel or Melanie?” Zora asked in a soft and sexy voice.
“Either is fine.”
“Then, Melanie, it is.”
“Your hair is gorgeous!” Mel gushed.
“As is yours,” she responded, taking a handful and twirling it between her fingers.
“I told her just how beautiful you are, Mel. And did I lie?” Allen asked, holding his hands to her like the statuesque women on game shows would when displaying a new car.
Mel became an entirely new shade of red. “Allen, please.” She laughed and turned to Zora. “If you know Allen at all, then you know how generous he is with his compliments. Zora, what can I get you to drink?”
“I’ll have whatever you’re having,” she smiled, putting her hand on top of Mel’s. The sound of ice cubes clinking together came from Christopher. He’d raised his glass and shook it. Allen snatched it from his hand, then he and Mel went to the bar.
“What’s going on, Allen?”
“I’m sorry for Christopher’s behavior.”
“That’s not what I meant. Why is Zora here?”
“I thought the two of you might hit it off,” he said innocently.
“Oh, good Christ,” she said, leaning on the marble surface. She closed her eyes and said, “Are you under the impression that I am a lesbian?”
“Well, yes.”
“Oh, my God,” she whispered, then laughed. “I can’t be upset with you. A tomboy is a stone’s throw from that. No, I’m not a lesbian. This beautiful woman was brought here as my date?”
“I am so sorry,” he said, thoroughly embarrassed. “Let me talk to Zora.”
“No. That’s OK. Let me,” Mel said. After handing Christopher his drink, she asked, “Zora, would you mind checking out the wine selections?”
“Not at all.”
Allen watched out of the corner of his eye as Mel placed her hand on Zora’s back. Mel smiled at her and spoke softly. A look of confusion came across Zora’s face as Mel spoke but quickly changed to a warm smile. Zora placed her hand on Mel’s. She kissed her on the forehead and, with her thumb, wiped the lipstick it left behind. Their attention turned to the wine. Mel laughed loudly at something Zora said. Christopher smirked at Mel. “Idiot,” he said under his breath. Allen shot him a look.
The evening continued as if nothing had happened. The dining room table was set, complete with two flower arrangements. Allen and Christopher sat at opposite ends of the table. Eric and Meghan sat on one side and Mel and Zora on the other.
Mel asked Eric, “How long have you two been together?”
Eric lifted Meghan’s hand from under the table and kissed it. “Two years. The first time I saw Meghan, I was hooked. I couldn’t take my eyes off her. Then she turned and looked at me and smiled. I couldn’t believe it. Everything came into focus. People say things like the sky is bluer, the birds sing more sweetly, and that is the truth. She was just what I needed in my life,” Eric said and leaned in for a kiss.

PART ONE — HER STYLE
Chapter 1—September 6th, 1972
The night breeze was a welcome sensation after spending six hours working up a sweat cleaning one of the NYU buildings off Washington Square. This seedy side of town always put Melanie on edge. The drenched bandana covering her hair would stay in place until she was safely back in her room. Reaching into her purple bag, she found her keys. Before putting one foot on the sidewalk, she made sure the keys were spread apart and protruding between her fingers.
The walk to the Village Plaza Hotel took as long as smoking one cigarette, three quarters if she was nervous. Three drags in, she heard a low, angry voice. A lighter voice responded as if confused. In the darkness of a doorway off to the left, Melanie could make out a large man hanging over a smaller person.
“Faggot, yer gonna get yer fuckin’ ass kicked,” he growled while raising his massive fist back over his shoulder. It was then that Mel realized the smaller person was a man trying to cover his head with his hands.
Quickly, she stepped toward them. “Honey, where have you been?” she asked, pulling the bandana off her head. The growler, still clenching his fist, turned to look at her. For just a few seconds, he stared at her. Her dirty bell-bottoms and loosely fitting t-shirt covering her slender body did not distract him from the long, curly-cue, strawberry blonde hair that framed her beautiful face and fell to her elbows. With one hand on her hip, she flicked the cigarette to the side. For a fleeting moment, the only sounds were a few crickets communicating with each other. She took that time to smile and step toward him. When she was close enough to see him begin to smile back, her right arm swung around, connecting with his left cheek and eye. The punch itself was not remarkable, but the keys split his face and it had begun to bleed. He lost his balance just enough to allow her to finish the job by kneeing him in the groin. He yelped in pain as he fell over, clutching his crotch. Placing her arm under the light voiced man’s arm, she brought him to his feet.
All he could do was stare at her. Not for her hair and sweet face, but because he was dumbstruck. He’d seen only one other woman fight like that.
Grabbing his hand, they ran down Washington Place. Twice, she looked back to see if the beast was behind them. Tugging him to the right, they ran into the hotel. The man behind the desk in the lobby yelled, “Where are you going?”
“It’s me, Melanie, Mr. Jones.” The three flights of stairs took the last of her energy. Looking back over her shoulder, she felt a little safer. She had not let go of his hand. At times, he’d run right beside her, others ahead of her. They stopped on the third floor. She let go of him and bent over, hands on her knees, trying to catch her breath. With a sweeping motion, she tossed her hair back and stood upright. In front of her darkened doorway, she finally looked over at him. Once her eyes adjusted to the light, she saw his face. In the shadows of a dimly lit bare bulb screwed into the ceiling, she could see his smile. He leaned against the wall with his hand shaking against his chest.
“You’ll be OK,” she tried to say in a calm voice.
His long, dark brown, shiny hair fell in layers just below his shoulders. A pair of Aviator prescription glasses rested on his significant and masculine nose. Eyeliner enhanced his almond-shaped brown eyes and long lashes. Her eyes fell to his mouth, and she couldn’t help but stare at his lips. They were the kind that made women jealous. Both the top and bottom were full. The deep dimples were like perpetual parentheses on the edges of that extraordinary mouth. Once he stood up straight, Melanie guessed he was only a few inches taller than her, putting him at about 5’11”. A bead of blood rolled down over his eyelid.
“Looks like he got a punch in.” She handed him a tissue from her bag, put her blood-covered door key in the worn lock and opened it. He followed her inside.
The kitchen was no more than an area in the otherwise Lilliputian room. She pulled the only chair from the tiny table and motioned for him to sit.
“What’s your name?” she asked as she rinsed off her keys.
“Allen. Shandi.”
She smiled. “Like the beer?”
“No,” he smiled, “as in boisterous.” He looked around the room. It was shabby but clean. Not like anything he’d ever experienced. “And what is your name? I heard you say, ‘Melanie.’”
“Yeah. Melanie. Mel. Foster.”
“As in cultivate?”
“Nah. Like the Grant’s.”
His laugh was light and feminine. Mel pulled a small container from under the twin bed and put it on the threadbare rug next to him. Inside was an assortment of necessities. It contained a sewing needle stuck in a spool of white thread, a hammer, a box of band-aids, a roll of tape, and a small glass container of hydrogen peroxide. She retrieved a band-aid and the bottle.
“Would you take off your glasses, please?”
“Truth be told, my vision is horrible. I can only see about a foot in front of me without them,” he told her.
“I’d like to clean out that cut. That bastard was filthy. It wouldn’t surprise me if you caught something just by breathing in the same space as that creep did. Your glasses could use a wipe, too.” He removed them and tilted his head towards her. “This might sting a bit,” Mel warned. She lifted his thick hair away from his forehead. The aroma of pot and sandalwood floated up to her and it made her smile. She lightly patted his head with a paper towel with the tiniest bit of hydrogen peroxide.
“Jesus!” He winced.
“I’m sorry,” she said, and blew on the cut.
“I haven’t thanked you for saving me from that Neanderthal. What would ever make you go after something that size?”
She paused. “The ‘f’ word.”
“Fuck?”
“Faggot.” The very word made her purse her lips. “May I have your glasses?” She took them, gave them a quick cleaning on her shirt, and held them out to him.
He reached for her hand holding the paper towel, but she quickly pulled away. He was startled by her reaction. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean anything by it,” he said. “I should go. Thank you for your care and time.” He put his glasses back on, then got up and walked to the door.
She was still holding the bloodied paper towel as he closed the door behind him. Her head fell back. “Oh, good Christ,” she said, disappointed in herself. “Let it go!” she whispered.
Once she’d quickly washed the dirty coffee cup from that morning and rinsed herself off in front of the sink, she fell onto the bed. The sounds of New York City outside her window had finally become familiar to her. That was not what kept her from relaxing. The image of his face kept returning to her. Allen was beautiful. He’s gay. She punched her pillow in hopes of making it more comfortable and closed her eyes. Tomorrow is Saturday. She began a mental list of things to do. Things like laundry and groceries and such needed to be done. But then, she heard his laugh in her head. Her eyes opened, and she sighed. There will not be much in the way of sleep tonight. “Happy birthday to me,” she whispered.
Chapter 2
It was nearly noon when she opened her eyes. A light knock on the door startled her. She jumped out of bed and put on her robe.
“Who’s there?”
“I have a delivery for Miss Grant,” a deep voice said.
“Miss Grant?” she whispered, and then it clicked. “Hold on.” Grabbing her bag off the floor, she searched inside until she found a quarter at the bottom. Pulling the door open just a crack, she could see an enormous assortment of purple and white flowers. She opened it wide enough to take them. Slowly, the bouquet lowered, and Allen’s eyes came into view. He playfully batted them at her.
She laughed. “What’s this?”
“It’s just a modest gift in appreciation of your bravery. Also…” He handed her a large, beautifully wrapped box. She took it from him.
“Come on in, please. You didn’t have to do this.”
He placed the flowers on the tiny table, then turned to her. After adjusting his glasses against his nose, Allen stood with his hands behind his back. His skin-tight, shiny black jeans flared out into a modest bell. The shoes looked like women’s leather square-toed chunky-heeled pumps, but he made them look great. The tan tank top was sheer enough that the hair on his chest and the outline of his nipples were evident. Around his neck he wore a slender black leather tie that was loosened and hung low on his chest. The knot itself was strange. A black silk scarf was wrapped several times around his left wrist and tied, leaving the ends hanging about six inches.
She sat on the bed, pulled off the wrapping, and lifted the lid. Inside was a proper first aid kit, a sewing kit complete with scissors, and a few smaller tools complete with two kinds of screwdrivers, a tape measure, pliers and an adjustable wrench.
“This is too much!”
He sat near her and took out an ‘L’ shaped piece of metal and examined it. “What is this?”
“It’s an Allen wrench,” she laughed. His smile disappeared, and he placed it back in the box. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to….” Tentatively, she patted his shoulder and rose from the bed. “Would you like a cup of coffee? All I have is instant.” She clutched her robe at the neck and started to open one of the two cabinets.
“I was hoping I could take you out for a bite. It’s a lovely day. We could walk a bit if you’d like.” Mel did not answer. “We could take a cab if you prefer.”
“I…I don’t have any clean clothes. Today is laundry day for me. Can I take a raincheck?” she finally asked, not meeting his eye as her face reddened.
“Well, this is all too perfect! How long will it take for you to put on whatever you would have worn to the laundromat? In 15 minutes, I’ll have a cab out front, alright?”
“I don’t…”
“Please?” He held out his hand. She looked down, smiled and swatted her fingertips with his.
“Alright, then. Meet me outside in fifteen minutes,” Allen said with a smile. Just before he closed the door, he looked back at her, flashed that incredible smile again, and gave a quick nod in a way that somehow relaxed any of her suspicious feelings.
She lifted a pair of hip huggers from the top of a pile of clothes in her closet and shook them out. Her only clean shirt was a lilac sleeveless turtleneck her brother made for her. She brushed her teeth with one hand and ran her fingers through her thick hair with the other. Laying out two pieces of bread on the counter, she assembled a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. She rinsed out the paper coffee cup she’d saved from the day before and filled it with milk. The lid still fit. There were far too many beautiful flowers in her bouquet not to share. She chose three cosmoses, cut the stems, and set them in a little water-filled jelly jar. Splashing water on her face, she looked at her reflection in the aged mirror on the wall. As ready as I’ll ever be. Taking a deep breath, Melanie slung her bag over her shoulder. She tried to walk calmly down the three flights of stairs.
Through the dirty front door window, she could see Allen leaning on a cab, chatting with the driver. Just then, a tall blonde man walked by them. Both heads swiveled, taking a long look at his ass. She had to chuckle.
“I’d check that out myself,” she whispered.
The day was quite a bit cooler than the day before. Allen took a cigarette from his pocket, along with a gold lighter. As he lit up, he saw Melanie walking toward him. She turned to the homeless man sitting up against the building. “Fred, here’s a little something to eat. Would you save me the glass?” He reached out for the paper bag and cup. With his free hand, he took hers and kissed it. Mumbling something unintelligible to her, she smiled and gave him the flowers.
He placed them up against his leg, cupped his hand around the glass and admired his gift.
A breeze drifted down the street. Melanie’s nipples shriveled from the cold air. Her knee-jerk reaction was to draw her arms up to her chest. Allen noticed and immediately felt embarrassed for her.
A policeman walked by them and stopped to observe Allen. He grabbed Mel’s hand, opened the door to the cab, and helped her in. Walking to the other side, Allen kept an eye on him. He tipped an imaginary cap to the officer and climbed inside. “Broome and Mercer,” he directed and turned to her. “You are adorable!” he said, smiling at Mel. The cabbie stared at him through the rearview mirror.
“Where were you coming from last night?” he asked her.
“My job. I didn’t ask you how your head is.”
He smiled. “It’s fine. Where do you work?”
“In the evenings, I clean some of the buildings at NYU.” She lifted his hair away from the cut. Clicking her tongue at the sight of the half dollar sized bruise developing, she asked, “Did you ice this?”
“No. How old are you?”
“20. And you?”
“24. Where are you from originally?”
“Upstate New York. A tiny town no one’s ever heard of.”
“Is that where you learned to fight?” he asked with a smile.
The color seemed to drain from her face. A silence hung between them until the cab hit a pothole that sent them both leaning hard to the right. She caught Allen as he fell against her.
Her loud, nervous laugh made its debut, and it certainly could draw attention.
“Oh my! Well, I love that sound!” he said.
The cab pulled over and made a hard stop. “Broome and Mercer, Mr. Shandi.” Allen’s tight pants forced him to lean to the left awkwardly. Jamming his right hand in his front pocket, he retrieved a bundle of bills. Mel glanced down at his hands. The bulge to the left of the bottom of his zipper caught her off guard. She very quickly looked away. He gave the cabbie a $5 tip.
“Thank you, Mr. Shandi!” His hand began to tremble as he put his money away. She took notice, and he caught that. He exited, went to her side of the cab and opened the door. Offering her his left hand, he helped her climb out.
“Are you hungry? I’m hungry. Let’s get lunch. My treat,” he said, looking across the street. He grabbed her hand and they sprinted through the traffic. Horns began honking, and a few cars stopped short. He held his hand up in a thanks gesture. She loved the way his hair bounced as he trotted. They entered a narrow eatery. A decidedly gay man welcomed Allen.
“Mr. Shandi, it’s so good to see you again. Your table is ready.” Other couples that had been waiting were not regulars or did not carry the same weight as Allen. She did not know what to make of this.
They were seated across from one another in a dark and quiet corner. Paper menus were brought to the table by a pretty young lady. “What can I get you to drink, Mr. Shandi?” she asked in a coquettish manner. She reached past Melanie’s face to light the candle and replaced the dirty ashtray with a clean one.
“What would you like, Mel?”
No one had called her that in at least five years.
“Coffee please, with milk?” she asked, looking at the waitress.
“I’ll have the same.”
The waitress placed her hand on his shoulder and said, “You’ve got it, Honey.” She walked away with quite a sway in her hips. Mel grinned and looked over to see Allen reaching for her over the table. He took a lock of her curly hair and rolled it between his fingers.
“If mermaids were real, this is the kind of hair they would have.”
She laughed as her face turned red. “Wow. I’ve never heard that before.” The art that was curiously placed up against the wall caught her eye. One piece in particular stood out. “Take a peek at that one! It’s a kaleidoscope!” She turned her attention back to his face. He’d been staring at her. Feeling embarrassed, she pretended to go over the menu. “Where are you from?” Mel asked.
“I’m not an interesting person,” he said while lighting a cigarette. “Would you like one?” he offered.
“No, thanks. I don’t want to hear your deepest, darkest secrets. How about, what do you do for a living? I feel like I’m the only one not in on it. Everybody knows you. I’ve lived here for five months, and I have no idea what you do or why you are so,” she paused, “beloved.”
“Beloved. That’s interesting.” He propped up his elbow on the table, and he rested his chin in his hand. The smoke from his cigarette curled up around his face. She sat back in the chair and crossed her ankle over her knee. Lacing her fingers together, she rested her hands in her lap. Giving him an “I’ve got all day” look, she took a deep breath.
Tapping his cigarette on the ashtray, he asked, “Have you ever heard of a clothing line called ‘Cleo’?”
“Yes. Do you work for her?”
“Well, I am her, so to speak. I named it after a knot I created for a necktie.” He pointed to the one that hung from his neck. It almost appeared to be a braid, and yet it was not. “The business has been open for three and a half years. It was perfect timing for my vision of what young women wanted. And the rest as they say…” he laughed, waving his cigarette in the air.
The waitress returned with the coffee. “Have you decided what you’d like to eat?” she asked, staring directly at Allen.
“Not really. Can we have a few more minutes?”
“Sure, Honey,” she answered and sashayed away, stopping once to look over her shoulder at Allen. But his thoughts were elsewhere.
“Have you always known you were…a visionary?” Mel asked as she stirred her coffee.
Allen glanced around to see if anyone was within earshot. He whispered, “What exactly are you asking?”
“My brother made this top for me. Not really my style, but he made it with love.” She gently touched the gauzy fabric around her neck. “Ben knew he was gay from the time he was a little boy,” Mel said softly. Her eyes welled up. “My mother simply ignored that fact. My father had an altogether different take on Ben. The things he would punish him for, well, it would just break your heart. That bastard took off in 1965. Good riddance.”
“Where is Ben now?”
“Buried in the Oswegatchie Cemetery outside of Fine, NY. Fine, NY! Funny, huh?” she laughed to cover the sadness.
More customers had begun to fill the place. The waitress returned once more. “What will it be?” she asked.
“Mel?” he asked.
She kept her head down and asked, “May I have a burger?” A tear rolled down her nose and fell on the menu.
“I’ll have the same,” he said. The waitress jotted it down as she walked away.
He gave Mel his napkin. “Dry your eyes, Sweetness,” then moved to a chair next to her and put his arm around her shoulders. “There are souls that are just too beautiful for this world,” he whispered in her ear. She had thought the very same thing a thousand times.
Two gay teens cautiously approached the table. Mel looked up. “Your fans, Mr. S! If you’ll excuse me…” The young men nearly levitated over a chance to chat with Allen. He watched her walk through a narrow doorway and into the restroom.
Splashing a little water on her face, she looked at her reflection. Her hands gripped the sides of the sink. “Pull it together,” she whispered to herself. Once she’d collected herself with a few deep breaths, she headed back to the table. She stopped and watched Allen as he spoke to them. He listened carefully as they replied and talked about their dreams.
Allen was leaning forward, elbows on his knees and speaking softly. He was incredibly patient as he explained what it took to get where he was. His enormous smile was evidence that he seemed to enjoy this part of his celebrity.
She leaned against the door frame, legs crossed at the ankles, her arms crossed just below her chest.
The two teens stood close to each other. For a second, their pinkies hooked together. Allen grinned. Removing the scarf from his wrist, he tied it around the wrist of the young man on the left, then lifted the tie from his neck and put it on the other fan. He held out his hand to shake theirs.
An older couple seated at a nearby table shook their heads in disapproval. Mel stood and stared at them for a moment, then turned her back and obstructed their view. The boys practically pogoed over to her.
“Johnny, isn’t he amazing?” the shorter of the two asked his boyfriend.
He grinned at Mel and said, “He’s amazing!”
“He certainly is,” she replied. The boys left overwhelmed with joy about what had just happened.
The burgers arrived at the table as Mel sat back down. “Thank you,” she said to the waitress and tried to make eye contact.
Finally, she looked at Mel and said, “You’re welcome.”
“Those kids will be living on that for a long time. That’s just about the sweetest thing I have ever seen,” she told him.
“I could say that about what you did for the guy sitting in front of your building earlier, but I won’t. Mine was sweeter.”
Her laugh reached the customers near the front door. “Sorry,” she said, covering her mouth, trying to muffle the sound. “You are a brat!”
“The boys’ names are Jon and Johnny. Isn’t that sweet? They’re hoping to open a clothing store in the village.” As he set his coffee cup on the saucer, his hand trembled again, rattling both. “Don’t ever apologize for your laugh. I like people that let their emotions out. I’d hate to think what would happen if you tried to hold that inside. It could be catastrophic! Your eyes and brain would be scattered everywhere!” he nearly shrilled, while his hand swiped through the air as if he were carrying a tray of filled coffee cups.
She was about to ask him about his hand, but he stood, excused himself, and headed toward the restroom. His hand, his life. It was quite simply none of her business.
When he returned, they continued to talk for another hour or so. Allen had participated in the Stonewall riots and Mel wanted to learn about every scrap of it.
“I witnessed the woman, Storme DeLarverie, fighting the cops. Some aren’t sure it was her, but I’m convinced it was. When she yelled out to us, ‘Why don’t you guys do something?’ we all went crazy. I guess we all have a boiling point.”
“Truer words, my friend. Ben wanted so much to be a part of it. He never hid who he was. All he ever wanted was to work for, well, someone exactly like you. Damn, you would have loved him,” she said, leaning back in her chair.
“The mob and the cops were involved in the whole thing. Talk about an uphill battle. At that time, the lesbians, queens and gays were not exactly a team.”
“Really? You’d think people treating all of you like dirt would be enough to pull everyone together,” she said.
“Well, to be fair, I’ve seen the same sort of division in the women’s movement.”
“You’re right.” She paused and said, “Things are going to change. They’ve got to. We have no control over who we fall in love with.” She lit one of the two cigarettes she had left. “Would you like one?” she offered. He waved it off. “Do you have somebody special in your life?” she asked.
“Yes, I do. A man named Christopher.” Allen’s eyes lit up.
“How did you meet?”
“Everyone thinks we met at a fashion show. We met while waiting for a cab. Long story short, we ended up sharing one and kept on sharing.”
“How long are the two of you together?”
“Almost a year,” he answered with a smile.
“How did you know it was love?”
“Oh, good Lord. How does anyone ever truly know? I wish I could say that it was love at first sight. Like a bolt of lightning jabbing me in the heart and I would never be the same. I think that’s bull. It never happens that way. How about you? Is there someone special?”
“No,” she said, stood and tossed her bag over her shoulder. She sighed as she thought about the bill. “I don’t even have enough money for a decent tip. I promise I will pay you back.” As she passed the kaleidoscope painting, she stopped to take a closer look but gasped when she saw the price.
He stood and tossed a few bills on the table. As he passed the waitress, he shoved a few additional bills into her pocket. “Thank you, dear.” She smiled at him, then continued to pour coffee into another young man’s cup, flirting away with her latest customer.
It felt good to have something substantial in her stomach for a change. As they left the eatery and headed north, a sophisticated man walked toward them. His Dobermann ignored the noises around him. “Geeze. Check out this beautiful beast,” she gushed. “Excuse me. May I pet him?” she asked the gentleman.
“He can be skittish,” he replied.
Mel held her hand out palm down. She let the dog take its time sniffing, and then she turned her hand over. He began to lick her fingers.
“Well, I’ll be,” said the man.
“My trick is to let them smell me when I just finished eating,” she joked. The gentleman chuckled as he and his pet went on with their walk.
“You like dogs?” Allen asked.
“To be honest, I love them. Dogs are such wonderful creatures. They love you no matter what. That’s hard to find.”
“Let me get a cab.” There were none in sight. While they waited at the curb, a policeman began to cross the street and headed toward them. Allen shoved his hand into his pockets and quietly asked, “Would you take my arm?”
Mel did not realize what was happening but did what he had asked. It was then that she noticed the officer. Mel laid her head on his shoulder and focused her gaze on a couple window shopping across the street. Once he had passed, she removed her arm from his. “I hate that fucking shit,” she hissed. Allen looked down at her face. Her eyes were blazing. He waved down an approaching cab, and they piled in.
“You can’t let it get to you,” he said in a matter-of fact kind of way. He turned his attention to the cabbie and said, “West Central Park and 69th.” This time, she accepted when he offered a cigarette.
Pulling her hair back, she leaned into the lighter’s flame. She sighed. “I’m not able to pay for anything, and it’s driving me nuts. I’m embarrassed,” and sighed again. “As soon as I…”
“Later, OK?” he asked and patted her hand.
She could not help but look up at all the high-reaching buildings that stood in Manhattan. “I can never get over just how immense this place is.” Her head was just about upside down, trying to get the best possible view.
“Yes. You are adorable.” She didn’t hear him. The city and all its energy had her full attention. Allen turned to the gorgeous driver. When they arrived at his address, the cabbie thanked Allen for the tip. He also handed him a slip of paper with his name and number on it.
Allen just smiled and put it in his pocket.
A uniformed doorman held open the heavy glass door. “Good afternoon, Mr. Shandi.”
“Hey there, George. How are Christina and the baby?”
“They are wonderful, thanks for asking.”
“Come on. You must have a picture, yes?”
With that, George pulled his wallet out of his pocket and opened it to a photo.
“Oh,” Allen said with a sigh. “Oh my gosh. They are lovely. Is Penelope about four months old now? Look at these beautiful women, Mel.”
She took the wallet. The woman in the photo looked thrilled to be a mom. Little Penelope’s toothless grin was precious. “You are a very lucky man,” she said placing her hand on her abdomen. Still smiling, she handed it back to him.
“Yes, I am.” George took a few seconds to look at the picture before putting it away.
“By the way, Christopher has taken Daphne for a walk.”
Allen gave him a wink. “Thanks, George.”
The elevator required a unique key to go to the penthouse. Mel and Allen rode it nine floors up. When the elevator doors opened, they stepped into a small area with a large door across the way. He opened it and they entered an extravagant vestibule. Mel had never seen or could even imagine such wealth. An older gentleman greeted Allen with his mail and messages.
He looked inquisitively at Melanie.
Allen said, “This is my sweet friend, Melanie. Mel, this is Quinten. If you need or want anything, this is your man.”
Mel extended her hand out to Quinten and said, “Nice to meet you.” He hesitated and looked at Allen. Allen grinned.
He took her hand and said, “It’s very nice to meet you. Would you prefer Mel or Melanie?”
“Either is fine. May I use the bathroom?”
“Of course, follow me, please.”
The bathroom was straight ahead and to the right. It was below a winding staircase with full bookshelves. Quinten lightly pressed the spine of a red and black book, and a door opened outward. Orange-yellow light spilled out onto the tiled floor.
“I’ve never actually seen a secret door. Very cool! Thank you,” she said and went inside. The dominant color was red, and the accent colors were black, gold and purple. Tiles of red with gold swirls outlined in black covered the bottom half of the walls. The upper half was crimson. She was sure the entire room was larger than her apartment. There were several black and red velvet ottomans and a purple and gold chaise lounge in a sitting area. On the other side of a half wall was the toilet and a bidet alongside it. Over the double sinks hung an enormous mirror with an ornate frame. She set her bag on the black marble counter between the sinks. As she sat on the toilet, she tried to take all of it in. “And this is just the bathroom,” she whispered. Once she’d finished, she washed her hands and raked her fingers through her hair.
Allen was waiting for her. “I’d like to show you something.” They went up the stairs and off to the left. After passing several rooms, Allen held open the door to a bedroom. She flashed him a confused expression.
“Oh! No. This isn’t one of those ‘I’d like to show you my etchings’ snares. I wanted to show you a few things from my collection. It’s through the doorway on the left.”
She did not budge. “Wait here,” he said and disappeared into that room. As he came back, he draped pieces of clothing on hangers across the bed. Spreading them out, he chose a backless sequin-covered halter top jumpsuit in champagne gold. “Isn’t this scrumptious?”
“It’s dazzling. But it’s not my style.”
He looked at the remainder of what was on the bed. “That’s the second time you’ve mentioned your style. What is your style, exactly?”
“I like a less feminine look, you know? I’ve always been a tomboy,” she said timidly. “Do you design things for men?”
The sound of quickly clicking toenails on the wood floor grew louder. With that, a magnificent Rottweiler burst into the room. “Daphne-love!” gushed Allen.
Catching his breath, Christopher followed. He stood over six feet tall, blonde hair parted on the right and trimmed with precision. Although he was slender, he was muscular the way 20-year-old men often are. “I’m back from our daily tug. She is going to pull my arm out one of these days,” he said.
Daphne’s interest shifted to the new scent in the room. Her full tail swished back and forth as she sniffed Mel’s feet and legs.
“Who is this?” Christopher asked, inspecting Mel.
She stuck out her hand, “I’m Mel Foster.” He hesitated for a moment, then took her hand. “It’s very nice to meet you,” she said. Still looking at Christopher, she asked, “Daphne’s tail is intact? I don’t think I’ve ever seen that. She’s a beauty.”
“We got her when she was a pup, and we specifically told them not to do that. It’s unthinkable,” Allen huffed.
Mel was on her knees, along with Christopher, cuddling and scratching her belly. “We had a large dog when I was little. Just a mutt, but at least 100 pounds. My father found a harness for her and it helped when we had to walk her.” Daphne jumped onto Mel knocking her back with her legs folded under her and began licking her face. Mel laughed and hugged her around the neck.
“Daphne!” Allen laughed. “Come! Come here, my girl.” She obediently went to his side.
“May I have a washcloth or something?” Mel asked once Allen had lured Daphne away.
Christopher answered, “Sure.” Mel followed him out of the bedroom and down the hall.
“Second door on the left,” he said with a forced smile.
She pushed the door, but it did not close all the way. Splashing her face with warm soap and water removed the drool from her face. Two black velvet ottomans placed side by side with a tiny table between were in the corner. She sat and took advantage of the small, crystal ashtray. Digging through her bag, she retrieved her last cigarette, matches and a hair clip. Taking a deep drag, she grabbed everything and went to the mirror. With the cigarette hanging from her mouth, she pulled her thick hair and piled it on the crown of her head. The extra-large leather slide barely fit over her mop of curls. She pushed the stick through the holes to secure everything in place. Invariably, five or six tendrils hung down around her neck, dripping down over her back and shoulders. She could hear a discussion growing louder coming from the bedroom. “She will end up becoming just another fag-hag for you. What is this, the fifth? I do not need yet another person hanging around watching us as if you and I were a freakshow,” Christopher said firmly.
“You are wrong about her. She’s one of us. Her ideas about women’s clothing are perfect for what’s down the road,” said Allen.
“Is that how you met her?” There was a pause.
Trying to make her presence known, Mel tugged the door open and stomped heavily onto the floor. Daphne flounced toward her. “I’m going to have to get going, little girl.” Holding either side of her enormous head, she kissed her loudly.
“Your hair. I love it!” declared Allen. “I have a proposal for you, Mel. You brought up a more masculine feel for women’s clothing. Would you help me bring that idea to life?” Allen asked.
“I don’t know the first thing about fashion.”
Christopher laughed, “You’ve got that right.”
“Now, now. Let’s not be bitchy,” said Allen.
Mel motioned toward Christopher while looking at Allen and said, “He understands that I do not…”
“Sometimes, all you need to know is what you like and what you don’t like,” said Allen. “Like art.” He grabbed her hand and led her to the back of the bedroom. After opening the double-door walk-in closet, he began to look through his clothes. He chose a white button-down shirt from his closet. “What would you do with this?” He held it out to her. His right arm was across his chest and was clutching his left bicep. His forearm extended outward with the palm of his hand facing the ceiling, and the shirt dangled from his fingertip. She would come to know this as his “What say you?” pose.
“Seriously?” She exhaled. Taking the shirt from him, she hung it from an indentation on one of the columns of the four-poster bed. Christopher gasped at the thought of damage done to the tiger maple column. “I would make it sleeveless and shorten the front to waist length.” She turned it around. Christopher stepped in and held it for her. “Thanks, Christopher. It could be darted a bit to fit my form, then lengthened the shirttail to fall just passed the…” she patted her rear.
“Ass?” Christopher asked. Allen gave him a look.
“Well, I was gonna say cheeks, but either fit. Split it up the middle to about two inches below the waistline. It would end up kind of like tails on a tux. If you could give it lapels rather than a collar, I think that would be something I’d like.”
“What would you wear with it?” asked Allen.
Taking a moment to think, she finally said, “I would wear straight leg jeans and man boots up to my knees. You know, the kind that you tie up in the front without the spiky heels.”
Allen looked over at Christopher and said, “Do you see what I mean?”
“Do you design clothes also, Christopher?”
He seemed insulted by the question. “I am a model,” he answered in a sharp tone.
“I’m sorry. I don’t read many magazines.” Pointing out her appearance with gesturing hands, she laughed, “Just look at me for crying out loud!”
“I have to give you that,” Christopher said.
“Honey, that’s not…” Allen started to say.
“But it’s funny and appropriate,” answered Mel. “Allen, thanks for all of this. I’ve got to get going.”
A nearly palpable look went from Allen to Christopher. Christopher shrugged his shoulders and said, “OK,” and he left the room.
“This might be forward, but I…we wondered if you would consider staying with us while we take Cleo in this new direction? This place has several empty rooms. But I think you’d truly love the one on the far end.”
“But I haven’t agreed to the clothing thing.”
He ignored her. She followed him to an enormous room down the hallway. Daphne’s toenails let them know she was right behind them. Everything was covered with sheets except the king-size bed. Sliding glass doors on the far side of the room led to a balcony complete with greenery and furniture. The walls were white, and the furniture was in varying shades of red. As the sun fell low in the sky, it cast a fantastic orangey-pink over everything around her, including Allen.
“Isn’t it gorgeous?”
“Yes, but I have a job,” she said.
He came toward her and held her by the shoulders. “This is an opportunity to grow. It will be your job. Name your price.” She was only aware of his hands on her. Everything else was a blur. “Please?” he asked, batting his eyes again. Allen bent down a bit to meet her eye and was inches from her face. “I need you.”
She paused, then finally said, “Yes. Thank you. Allen, I am so grateful…” but the lump in her throat and tears squelched her ability to speak.
Allen threw his arms around her and she pulled away just a bit. He laughed and said, “I’m sorry. I excite easily!”
“Good to know,” she said, patting him on the back. He laughed into her ear. The sensation of his breath on her neck was incredible and alarming at once. “I have one request.”
“Name it.”
She pulled back and placed her hands on his chest. “I am not a huggee, cuddly, touchy-feely person. Please, don’t take it the wrong way. You are such a great guy, a real gentleman. You would never deliberately hurt anyone. It just makes me uncomfortable.”
He looked into her eyes. “Of course, I can respect that.” He backed away. “I understand, you know. Maybe better than most. I was different, too.” She felt light-headed.
“Are you alright?” he asked.
“Yes. I think I need a shower and a good night’s sleep.”
“Can I have Quinten bring you a bite to eat?”
“No, not right now. If I get hungry, I’ll poke around the kitchen, if that’s OK.”
“It’s fine with me, but Quinten gets a bit touchy when his domain is disturbed.”
“I promise I’ll clean up after myself,” she offered.
“Good Lord, woman, I was joking! Feel free to have anything you’d like.” He left her room and closed the door behind him.
Chapter 3
By the next morning, all of Mel’s belongings had been picked up and delivered to the penthouse. That afternoon, Allen purchased a month’s worth of clothing for her right down to her panties, along with a carton of her favorite cigarettes plus several joints. She sat on the edge of the bed surrounded by all of it, including the jelly jar she’d given to Fred and her prized possession. It was an old lockbox. Taking the key out of her bag, she placed the box on her lap and opened it slowly. Lifting the three photographs of her brother, Benjamin, from inside, she traced his face with her finger. It also contained a spool of fishing line. She looked up to see Allen standing in the doorway. She closed the box and set it aside.
“Would you like a hand putting things away?” he asked.
“I can’t accept all of this.”
“Consider it an advance,” he said. “Anything you dislike will be returned, exchanged, whatever.” He walked toward her.
Mel stood and moved toward the middle of the room. “You could have let my friend keep the glass,” she remarked.
“I did something a little better, I think. I hope you agree. Fred now occupies your old apartment, and I’ve paid up for two years. He has several new outfits, a bit of cash, and will be filling in at your old job until you decide what you want to do. I will find another place for you to live if you think this isn’t working out, but I want you to share your ideas with me,” he said in a serious tone.
She turned away from him. “I’m going to do my very best for you. Thank you for giving me this chance.”
He moved toward her, then thought better of it. Quinten knocked on the door frame.
“Excuse me, Sir. How many for dinner tonight?”
“Six, I think. Very casual, OK?” Allen asked.
“Time?”
“Six-thirty.”
“Is there anything, in particular, you would like tonight, Sir?”
“Mel, if you sat down in a restaurant and could have anything you wanted, what would it be?” Allen asked her.
She chuckled. “I feel as if I’m in a dream, or I’m high. Maybe I’ve died and gone to Heaven.” She asked timidly, “Do you like spaghetti and meatballs and maybe a salad?”
“Perfect. Is that doable, Quinten?”
“Of course, Sir. Can I get you anything in the meantime, Miss Melanie?”
“No thanks, and for God’s sake, drop the Miss. You make me feel as if I’m the character in ‘Gone with the Wind’! Or worse, my mother.”
“Quinten, could you give us a minute?”
“Of course,” he said and went downstairs.
Allen sat on the bench at the foot of the bed. His legs crossed at the knee and leaning back on his hands. “Did I tell you how I ended up living here?” he asked Mel. She shook her head, no. He gestured with his hand for her to sit next to him. She sat beside him with her legs apart, her elbows resting on her thighs and hands folded. He brushed her hair over her shoulder.
“I just want to see your face, OK?”
“Yes,” she answered and looked at him.
“My father owned an oil conglomerate. It doesn’t matter which one. They are all greed-factories. He could buy and sell God, or so he said. The best part is that God got the last laugh. One morning he told his secretary that there were to be no phone calls, no interruptions. He had a massive heart attack at his desk while she typed away just outside his door. Side note, she was also his mistress. An hour and a half later, she poked her head in to ask a question. She found him sweat-soaked and face down in a pool of his vomit. The Man upstairs is a funny guy, don’t you agree?”
“I gather you were not close to him?”
“No one was. My father loved money and fucking women. If he could have figured out a way to bang them with a roll of hundreds on his cock, it would have been his ejaculation of a lifetime.”
“Wow,” she chuckled. “How did your mom take it?”
“Poor thing, she loved him and not for his money. She would tell me about the 19-year-old boy she’d met all those years ago. Generous, kind, hardworking and very gentle with her. Somewhere along the line, he soured. He began drinking to excess and worse, hitting her. He became ruthless.”
“Did he know you are gay?”
“I think if he’d spent just a bit of time with me, he would have. But you must be in the same room with a person, look into their eyes, listen to what they say to learn anything. My wonderful mother died two years after my father. Countless homes, cars, all kinds of ‘things’ had become the property of my brother and me. Did I tell you I have a brother? Keith. Funny guy. A good man. Anyway. He and I sold most of it and gave the money to charities for the homeless, hospitals, but the best was handing out money to anyone that looked like they could use it. We knew this would make the old bastard roll in his grave. Even better, we made the donations in his name.”
“Ooooh, you scoundrels. I love it,” she laughed.
“Quinten has been with our family since before I was born. He is an old-fashioned gentleman’s gentleman. He just can’t help himself. I know for certain there were times that he would intercept when that bastard was after my mom. He’d lie and say there was a phone call or news on TV about my father’s company. My father was so drunk he probably could have distracted him with a ring of keys, …like an infant. All that being said, Quinten is who he is, and we accept him that way. Alright?”
Her face was beet red. “Yes. Understood. I’ll make it right.” She looked back on the bed and asked, “I hate to sound like such a girl, but what are you wearing tonight?”
Allen laughed. “How do jeans and a shirt sound? Shoes are optional.”
“Comfortable, thank you.”
Allen’s chef, Wyatt Edmonds, had taken the time to ask Mel about her selection for dinner, right down to the amount of garlic or basil. He stood at six foot four and two hundred forty pounds of muscle. He looked extremely intimidating, but that turned out to be completely wrong. He was a gentle and soft-spoken man. It was moving to see his interest in what would make her happy.
That evening, softly playing jazz hung in the background. Allen and Christopher were in one of two black loveseats in a cozy area of the living room. The other loveseat was directly across from them, with two red high-back chairs between them facing the fireplace. A black lacquered coffee table sat between it all.
The first to arrive were two women that worked in the garment district. Eric had red cropped hair and was wearing a man’s blue button-down shirt tucked into her black jeans with a matching blue belt and sneakers.
Mel asked Eric, “May I ask, do you consider yourself a ‘he’ or ‘she’?”
“He, and thank you for asking.” His girlfriend, Meghan also had red hair, but shoulder length. She wore a short denim skirt, a red sweater and black high heels. After the introductions, Allen offered drinks. Eric would have his usual Pabst Blue Ribbon beer in a pint glass while Meghan preferred white wine. Rather than help, Christopher called out for a vodka and tonic. As Allen gave Eric and Meghan their drinks, he heard the elevator door open and excused himself. Mel went to the bar to make Christopher’s drink. She brought it to him and asked, “What do you think Allen will have?”
“I have no idea,” he answered, not meeting her eyes.
“Mel, meet Zora Preston. She is a buyer for one of the high-end stores on 5th Avenue. Zora, Mel Foster.”
She was a tall, curvy African American woman with a beautiful, giant Afro. She wore a tight-fitting, sleeveless black turtleneck sweater, large gold hoop earrings and a floor-length striped skirt in all the colors of the rainbow. Mel smiled and shook her hand. “Do you prefer Mel or Melanie?” Zora asked in a soft and sexy voice.
“Either is fine.”
“Then, Melanie, it is.”
“Your hair is gorgeous!” Mel gushed.
“As is yours,” she responded, taking a handful and twirling it between her fingers.
“I told her just how beautiful you are, Mel. And did I lie?” Allen asked, holding his hands to her like the statuesque women on game shows would when displaying a new car.
Mel became an entirely new shade of red. “Allen, please.” She laughed and turned to Zora. “If you know Allen at all, then you know how generous he is with his compliments. Zora, what can I get you to drink?”
“I’ll have whatever you’re having,” she smiled, putting her hand on top of Mel’s. The sound of ice cubes clinking together came from Christopher. He’d raised his glass and shook it. Allen snatched it from his hand, then he and Mel went to the bar.
“What’s going on, Allen?”
“I’m sorry for Christopher’s behavior.”
“That’s not what I meant. Why is Zora here?”
“I thought the two of you might hit it off,” he said innocently.
“Oh, good Christ,” she said, leaning on the marble surface. She closed her eyes and said, “Are you under the impression that I am a lesbian?”
“Well, yes.”
“Oh, my God,” she whispered, then laughed. “I can’t be upset with you. A tomboy is a stone’s throw from that. No, I’m not a lesbian. This beautiful woman was brought here as my date?”
“I am so sorry,” he said, thoroughly embarrassed. “Let me talk to Zora.”
“No. That’s OK. Let me,” Mel said. After handing Christopher his drink, she asked, “Zora, would you mind checking out the wine selections?”
“Not at all.”
Allen watched out of the corner of his eye as Mel placed her hand on Zora’s back. Mel smiled at her and spoke softly. A look of confusion came across Zora’s face as Mel spoke but quickly changed to a warm smile. Zora placed her hand on Mel’s. She kissed her on the forehead and, with her thumb, wiped the lipstick it left behind. Their attention turned to the wine. Mel laughed loudly at something Zora said. Christopher smirked at Mel. “Idiot,” he said under his breath. Allen shot him a look.
The evening continued as if nothing had happened. The dining room table was set, complete with two flower arrangements. Allen and Christopher sat at opposite ends of the table. Eric and Meghan sat on one side and Mel and Zora on the other.
Mel asked Eric, “How long have you two been together?”
Eric lifted Meghan’s hand from under the table and kissed it. “Two years. The first time I saw Meghan, I was hooked. I couldn’t take my eyes off her. Then she turned and looked at me and smiled. I couldn’t believe it. Everything came into focus. People say things like the sky is bluer, the birds sing more sweetly, and that is the truth. She was just what I needed in my life,” Eric said and leaned in for a kiss.

PART ONE — HER STYLE
Chapter 1—September 6th, 1972
The night breeze was a welcome sensation after spending six hours working up a sweat cleaning one of the NYU buildings off Washington Square. This seedy side of town always put Melanie on edge. The drenched bandana covering her hair would stay in place until she was safely back in her room. Reaching into her purple bag, she found her keys. Before putting one foot on the sidewalk, she made sure the keys were spread apart and protruding between her fingers.
The walk to the Village Plaza Hotel took as long as smoking one cigarette, three quarters if she was nervous. Three drags in, she heard a low, angry voice. A lighter voice responded as if confused. In the darkness of a doorway off to the left, Melanie could make out a large man hanging over a smaller person.
“Faggot, yer gonna get yer fuckin’ ass kicked,” he growled while raising his massive fist back over his shoulder. It was then that Mel realized the smaller person was a man trying to cover his head with his hands.
Quickly, she stepped toward them. “Honey, where have you been?” she asked, pulling the bandana off her head. The growler, still clenching his fist, turned to look at her. For just a few seconds, he stared at her. Her dirty bell-bottoms and loosely fitting t-shirt covering her slender body did not distract him from the long, curly-cue, strawberry blonde hair that framed her beautiful face and fell to her elbows. With one hand on her hip, she flicked the cigarette to the side. For a fleeting moment, the only sounds were a few crickets communicating with each other. She took that time to smile and step toward him. When she was close enough to see him begin to smile back, her right arm swung around, connecting with his left cheek and eye. The punch itself was not remarkable, but the keys split his face and it had begun to bleed. He lost his balance just enough to allow her to finish the job by kneeing him in the groin. He yelped in pain as he fell over, clutching his crotch. Placing her arm under the light voiced man’s arm, she brought him to his feet.
All he could do was stare at her. Not for her hair and sweet face, but because he was dumbstruck. He’d seen only one other woman fight like that.
Grabbing his hand, they ran down Washington Place. Twice, she looked back to see if the beast was behind them. Tugging him to the right, they ran into the hotel. The man behind the desk in the lobby yelled, “Where are you going?”
“It’s me, Melanie, Mr. Jones.” The three flights of stairs took the last of her energy. Looking back over her shoulder, she felt a little safer. She had not let go of his hand. At times, he’d run right beside her, others ahead of her. They stopped on the third floor. She let go of him and bent over, hands on her knees, trying to catch her breath. With a sweeping motion, she tossed her hair back and stood upright. In front of her darkened doorway, she finally looked over at him. Once her eyes adjusted to the light, she saw his face. In the shadows of a dimly lit bare bulb screwed into the ceiling, she could see his smile. He leaned against the wall with his hand shaking against his chest.
“You’ll be OK,” she tried to say in a calm voice.
His long, dark brown, shiny hair fell in layers just below his shoulders. A pair of Aviator prescription glasses rested on his significant and masculine nose. Eyeliner enhanced his almond-shaped brown eyes and long lashes. Her eyes fell to his mouth, and she couldn’t help but stare at his lips. They were the kind that made women jealous. Both the top and bottom were full. The deep dimples were like perpetual parentheses on the edges of that extraordinary mouth. Once he stood up straight, Melanie guessed he was only a few inches taller than her, putting him at about 5’11”. A bead of blood rolled down over his eyelid.
“Looks like he got a punch in.” She handed him a tissue from her bag, put her blood-covered door key in the worn lock and opened it. He followed her inside.
The kitchen was no more than an area in the otherwise Lilliputian room. She pulled the only chair from the tiny table and motioned for him to sit.
“What’s your name?” she asked as she rinsed off her keys.
“Allen. Shandi.”
She smiled. “Like the beer?”
“No,” he smiled, “as in boisterous.” He looked around the room. It was shabby but clean. Not like anything he’d ever experienced. “And what is your name? I heard you say, ‘Melanie.’”
“Yeah. Melanie. Mel. Foster.”
“As in cultivate?”
“Nah. Like the Grant’s.”
His laugh was light and feminine. Mel pulled a small container from under the twin bed and put it on the threadbare rug next to him. Inside was an assortment of necessities. It contained a sewing needle stuck in a spool of white thread, a hammer, a box of band-aids, a roll of tape, and a small glass container of hydrogen peroxide. She retrieved a band-aid and the bottle.
“Would you take off your glasses, please?”
“Truth be told, my vision is horrible. I can only see about a foot in front of me without them,” he told her.
“I’d like to clean out that cut. That bastard was filthy. It wouldn’t surprise me if you caught something just by breathing in the same space as that creep did. Your glasses could use a wipe, too.” He removed them and tilted his head towards her. “This might sting a bit,” Mel warned. She lifted his thick hair away from his forehead. The aroma of pot and sandalwood floated up to her and it made her smile. She lightly patted his head with a paper towel with the tiniest bit of hydrogen peroxide.
“Jesus!” He winced.
“I’m sorry,” she said, and blew on the cut.
“I haven’t thanked you for saving me from that Neanderthal. What would ever make you go after something that size?”
She paused. “The ‘f’ word.”
“Fuck?”
“Faggot.” The very word made her purse her lips. “May I have your glasses?” She took them, gave them a quick cleaning on her shirt, and held them out to him.
He reached for her hand holding the paper towel, but she quickly pulled away. He was startled by her reaction. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean anything by it,” he said. “I should go. Thank you for your care and time.” He put his glasses back on, then got up and walked to the door.
She was still holding the bloodied paper towel as he closed the door behind him. Her head fell back. “Oh, good Christ,” she said, disappointed in herself. “Let it go!” she whispered.
Once she’d quickly washed the dirty coffee cup from that morning and rinsed herself off in front of the sink, she fell onto the bed. The sounds of New York City outside her window had finally become familiar to her. That was not what kept her from relaxing. The image of his face kept returning to her. Allen was beautiful. He’s gay. She punched her pillow in hopes of making it more comfortable and closed her eyes. Tomorrow is Saturday. She began a mental list of things to do. Things like laundry and groceries and such needed to be done. But then, she heard his laugh in her head. Her eyes opened, and she sighed. There will not be much in the way of sleep tonight. “Happy birthday to me,” she whispered.
Chapter 2
It was nearly noon when she opened her eyes. A light knock on the door startled her. She jumped out of bed and put on her robe.
“Who’s there?”
“I have a delivery for Miss Grant,” a deep voice said.
“Miss Grant?” she whispered, and then it clicked. “Hold on.” Grabbing her bag off the floor, she searched inside until she found a quarter at the bottom. Pulling the door open just a crack, she could see an enormous assortment of purple and white flowers. She opened it wide enough to take them. Slowly, the bouquet lowered, and Allen’s eyes came into view. He playfully batted them at her.
She laughed. “What’s this?”
“It’s just a modest gift in appreciation of your bravery. Also…” He handed her a large, beautifully wrapped box. She took it from him.
“Come on in, please. You didn’t have to do this.”
He placed the flowers on the tiny table, then turned to her. After adjusting his glasses against his nose, Allen stood with his hands behind his back. His skin-tight, shiny black jeans flared out into a modest bell. The shoes looked like women’s leather square-toed chunky-heeled pumps, but he made them look great. The tan tank top was sheer enough that the hair on his chest and the outline of his nipples were evident. Around his neck he wore a slender black leather tie that was loosened and hung low on his chest. The knot itself was strange. A black silk scarf was wrapped several times around his left wrist and tied, leaving the ends hanging about six inches.
She sat on the bed, pulled off the wrapping, and lifted the lid. Inside was a proper first aid kit, a sewing kit complete with scissors, and a few smaller tools complete with two kinds of screwdrivers, a tape measure, pliers and an adjustable wrench.
“This is too much!”
He sat near her and took out an ‘L’ shaped piece of metal and examined it. “What is this?”
“It’s an Allen wrench,” she laughed. His smile disappeared, and he placed it back in the box. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to….” Tentatively, she patted his shoulder and rose from the bed. “Would you like a cup of coffee? All I have is instant.” She clutched her robe at the neck and started to open one of the two cabinets.
“I was hoping I could take you out for a bite. It’s a lovely day. We could walk a bit if you’d like.” Mel did not answer. “We could take a cab if you prefer.”
“I…I don’t have any clean clothes. Today is laundry day for me. Can I take a raincheck?” she finally asked, not meeting his eye as her face reddened.
“Well, this is all too perfect! How long will it take for you to put on whatever you would have worn to the laundromat? In 15 minutes, I’ll have a cab out front, alright?”
“I don’t…”
“Please?” He held out his hand. She looked down, smiled and swatted her fingertips with his.
“Alright, then. Meet me outside in fifteen minutes,” Allen said with a smile. Just before he closed the door, he looked back at her, flashed that incredible smile again, and gave a quick nod in a way that somehow relaxed any of her suspicious feelings.
She lifted a pair of hip huggers from the top of a pile of clothes in her closet and shook them out. Her only clean shirt was a lilac sleeveless turtleneck her brother made for her. She brushed her teeth with one hand and ran her fingers through her thick hair with the other. Laying out two pieces of bread on the counter, she assembled a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. She rinsed out the paper coffee cup she’d saved from the day before and filled it with milk. The lid still fit. There were far too many beautiful flowers in her bouquet not to share. She chose three cosmoses, cut the stems, and set them in a little water-filled jelly jar. Splashing water on her face, she looked at her reflection in the aged mirror on the wall. As ready as I’ll ever be. Taking a deep breath, Melanie slung her bag over her shoulder. She tried to walk calmly down the three flights of stairs.
Through the dirty front door window, she could see Allen leaning on a cab, chatting with the driver. Just then, a tall blonde man walked by them. Both heads swiveled, taking a long look at his ass. She had to chuckle.
“I’d check that out myself,” she whispered.
The day was quite a bit cooler than the day before. Allen took a cigarette from his pocket, along with a gold lighter. As he lit up, he saw Melanie walking toward him. She turned to the homeless man sitting up against the building. “Fred, here’s a little something to eat. Would you save me the glass?” He reached out for the paper bag and cup. With his free hand, he took hers and kissed it. Mumbling something unintelligible to her, she smiled and gave him the flowers.
He placed them up against his leg, cupped his hand around the glass and admired his gift.
A breeze drifted down the street. Melanie’s nipples shriveled from the cold air. Her knee-jerk reaction was to draw her arms up to her chest. Allen noticed and immediately felt embarrassed for her.
A policeman walked by them and stopped to observe Allen. He grabbed Mel’s hand, opened the door to the cab, and helped her in. Walking to the other side, Allen kept an eye on him. He tipped an imaginary cap to the officer and climbed inside. “Broome and Mercer,” he directed and turned to her. “You are adorable!” he said, smiling at Mel. The cabbie stared at him through the rearview mirror.
“Where were you coming from last night?” he asked her.
“My job. I didn’t ask you how your head is.”
He smiled. “It’s fine. Where do you work?”
“In the evenings, I clean some of the buildings at NYU.” She lifted his hair away from the cut. Clicking her tongue at the sight of the half dollar sized bruise developing, she asked, “Did you ice this?”
“No. How old are you?”
“20. And you?”
“24. Where are you from originally?”
“Upstate New York. A tiny town no one’s ever heard of.”
“Is that where you learned to fight?” he asked with a smile.
The color seemed to drain from her face. A silence hung between them until the cab hit a pothole that sent them both leaning hard to the right. She caught Allen as he fell against her.
Her loud, nervous laugh made its debut, and it certainly could draw attention.
“Oh my! Well, I love that sound!” he said.
The cab pulled over and made a hard stop. “Broome and Mercer, Mr. Shandi.” Allen’s tight pants forced him to lean to the left awkwardly. Jamming his right hand in his front pocket, he retrieved a bundle of bills. Mel glanced down at his hands. The bulge to the left of the bottom of his zipper caught her off guard. She very quickly looked away. He gave the cabbie a $5 tip.
“Thank you, Mr. Shandi!” His hand began to tremble as he put his money away. She took notice, and he caught that. He exited, went to her side of the cab and opened the door. Offering her his left hand, he helped her climb out.
“Are you hungry? I’m hungry. Let’s get lunch. My treat,” he said, looking across the street. He grabbed her hand and they sprinted through the traffic. Horns began honking, and a few cars stopped short. He held his hand up in a thanks gesture. She loved the way his hair bounced as he trotted. They entered a narrow eatery. A decidedly gay man welcomed Allen.
“Mr. Shandi, it’s so good to see you again. Your table is ready.” Other couples that had been waiting were not regulars or did not carry the same weight as Allen. She did not know what to make of this.
They were seated across from one another in a dark and quiet corner. Paper menus were brought to the table by a pretty young lady. “What can I get you to drink, Mr. Shandi?” she asked in a coquettish manner. She reached past Melanie’s face to light the candle and replaced the dirty ashtray with a clean one.
“What would you like, Mel?”
No one had called her that in at least five years.
“Coffee please, with milk?” she asked, looking at the waitress.
“I’ll have the same.”
The waitress placed her hand on his shoulder and said, “You’ve got it, Honey.” She walked away with quite a sway in her hips. Mel grinned and looked over to see Allen reaching for her over the table. He took a lock of her curly hair and rolled it between his fingers.
“If mermaids were real, this is the kind of hair they would have.”
She laughed as her face turned red. “Wow. I’ve never heard that before.” The art that was curiously placed up against the wall caught her eye. One piece in particular stood out. “Take a peek at that one! It’s a kaleidoscope!” She turned her attention back to his face. He’d been staring at her. Feeling embarrassed, she pretended to go over the menu. “Where are you from?” Mel asked.
“I’m not an interesting person,” he said while lighting a cigarette. “Would you like one?” he offered.
“No, thanks. I don’t want to hear your deepest, darkest secrets. How about, what do you do for a living? I feel like I’m the only one not in on it. Everybody knows you. I’ve lived here for five months, and I have no idea what you do or why you are so,” she paused, “beloved.”
“Beloved. That’s interesting.” He propped up his elbow on the table, and he rested his chin in his hand. The smoke from his cigarette curled up around his face. She sat back in the chair and crossed her ankle over her knee. Lacing her fingers together, she rested her hands in her lap. Giving him an “I’ve got all day” look, she took a deep breath.
Tapping his cigarette on the ashtray, he asked, “Have you ever heard of a clothing line called ‘Cleo’?”
“Yes. Do you work for her?”
“Well, I am her, so to speak. I named it after a knot I created for a necktie.” He pointed to the one that hung from his neck. It almost appeared to be a braid, and yet it was not. “The business has been open for three and a half years. It was perfect timing for my vision of what young women wanted. And the rest as they say…” he laughed, waving his cigarette in the air.
The waitress returned with the coffee. “Have you decided what you’d like to eat?” she asked, staring directly at Allen.
“Not really. Can we have a few more minutes?”
“Sure, Honey,” she answered and sashayed away, stopping once to look over her shoulder at Allen. But his thoughts were elsewhere.
“Have you always known you were…a visionary?” Mel asked as she stirred her coffee.
Allen glanced around to see if anyone was within earshot. He whispered, “What exactly are you asking?”
“My brother made this top for me. Not really my style, but he made it with love.” She gently touched the gauzy fabric around her neck. “Ben knew he was gay from the time he was a little boy,” Mel said softly. Her eyes welled up. “My mother simply ignored that fact. My father had an altogether different take on Ben. The things he would punish him for, well, it would just break your heart. That bastard took off in 1965. Good riddance.”
“Where is Ben now?”
“Buried in the Oswegatchie Cemetery outside of Fine, NY. Fine, NY! Funny, huh?” she laughed to cover the sadness.
More customers had begun to fill the place. The waitress returned once more. “What will it be?” she asked.
“Mel?” he asked.
She kept her head down and asked, “May I have a burger?” A tear rolled down her nose and fell on the menu.
“I’ll have the same,” he said. The waitress jotted it down as she walked away.
He gave Mel his napkin. “Dry your eyes, Sweetness,” then moved to a chair next to her and put his arm around her shoulders. “There are souls that are just too beautiful for this world,” he whispered in her ear. She had thought the very same thing a thousand times.
Two gay teens cautiously approached the table. Mel looked up. “Your fans, Mr. S! If you’ll excuse me…” The young men nearly levitated over a chance to chat with Allen. He watched her walk through a narrow doorway and into the restroom.
Splashing a little water on her face, she looked at her reflection. Her hands gripped the sides of the sink. “Pull it together,” she whispered to herself. Once she’d collected herself with a few deep breaths, she headed back to the table. She stopped and watched Allen as he spoke to them. He listened carefully as they replied and talked about their dreams.
Allen was leaning forward, elbows on his knees and speaking softly. He was incredibly patient as he explained what it took to get where he was. His enormous smile was evidence that he seemed to enjoy this part of his celebrity.
She leaned against the door frame, legs crossed at the ankles, her arms crossed just below her chest.
The two teens stood close to each other. For a second, their pinkies hooked together. Allen grinned. Removing the scarf from his wrist, he tied it around the wrist of the young man on the left, then lifted the tie from his neck and put it on the other fan. He held out his hand to shake theirs.
An older couple seated at a nearby table shook their heads in disapproval. Mel stood and stared at them for a moment, then turned her back and obstructed their view. The boys practically pogoed over to her.
“Johnny, isn’t he amazing?” the shorter of the two asked his boyfriend.
He grinned at Mel and said, “He’s amazing!”
“He certainly is,” she replied. The boys left overwhelmed with joy about what had just happened.
The burgers arrived at the table as Mel sat back down. “Thank you,” she said to the waitress and tried to make eye contact.
Finally, she looked at Mel and said, “You’re welcome.”
“Those kids will be living on that for a long time. That’s just about the sweetest thing I have ever seen,” she told him.
“I could say that about what you did for the guy sitting in front of your building earlier, but I won’t. Mine was sweeter.”
Her laugh reached the customers near the front door. “Sorry,” she said, covering her mouth, trying to muffle the sound. “You are a brat!”
“The boys’ names are Jon and Johnny. Isn’t that sweet? They’re hoping to open a clothing store in the village.” As he set his coffee cup on the saucer, his hand trembled again, rattling both. “Don’t ever apologize for your laugh. I like people that let their emotions out. I’d hate to think what would happen if you tried to hold that inside. It could be catastrophic! Your eyes and brain would be scattered everywhere!” he nearly shrilled, while his hand swiped through the air as if he were carrying a tray of filled coffee cups.
She was about to ask him about his hand, but he stood, excused himself, and headed toward the restroom. His hand, his life. It was quite simply none of her business.
When he returned, they continued to talk for another hour or so. Allen had participated in the Stonewall riots and Mel wanted to learn about every scrap of it.
“I witnessed the woman, Storme DeLarverie, fighting the cops. Some aren’t sure it was her, but I’m convinced it was. When she yelled out to us, ‘Why don’t you guys do something?’ we all went crazy. I guess we all have a boiling point.”
“Truer words, my friend. Ben wanted so much to be a part of it. He never hid who he was. All he ever wanted was to work for, well, someone exactly like you. Damn, you would have loved him,” she said, leaning back in her chair.
“The mob and the cops were involved in the whole thing. Talk about an uphill battle. At that time, the lesbians, queens and gays were not exactly a team.”
“Really? You’d think people treating all of you like dirt would be enough to pull everyone together,” she said.
“Well, to be fair, I’ve seen the same sort of division in the women’s movement.”
“You’re right.” She paused and said, “Things are going to change. They’ve got to. We have no control over who we fall in love with.” She lit one of the two cigarettes she had left. “Would you like one?” she offered. He waved it off. “Do you have somebody special in your life?” she asked.
“Yes, I do. A man named Christopher.” Allen’s eyes lit up.
“How did you meet?”
“Everyone thinks we met at a fashion show. We met while waiting for a cab. Long story short, we ended up sharing one and kept on sharing.”
“How long are the two of you together?”
“Almost a year,” he answered with a smile.
“How did you know it was love?”
“Oh, good Lord. How does anyone ever truly know? I wish I could say that it was love at first sight. Like a bolt of lightning jabbing me in the heart and I would never be the same. I think that’s bull. It never happens that way. How about you? Is there someone special?”
“No,” she said, stood and tossed her bag over her shoulder. She sighed as she thought about the bill. “I don’t even have enough money for a decent tip. I promise I will pay you back.” As she passed the kaleidoscope painting, she stopped to take a closer look but gasped when she saw the price.
He stood and tossed a few bills on the table. As he passed the waitress, he shoved a few additional bills into her pocket. “Thank you, dear.” She smiled at him, then continued to pour coffee into another young man’s cup, flirting away with her latest customer.
It felt good to have something substantial in her stomach for a change. As they left the eatery and headed north, a sophisticated man walked toward them. His Dobermann ignored the noises around him. “Geeze. Check out this beautiful beast,” she gushed. “Excuse me. May I pet him?” she asked the gentleman.
“He can be skittish,” he replied.
Mel held her hand out palm down. She let the dog take its time sniffing, and then she turned her hand over. He began to lick her fingers.
“Well, I’ll be,” said the man.
“My trick is to let them smell me when I just finished eating,” she joked. The gentleman chuckled as he and his pet went on with their walk.
“You like dogs?” Allen asked.
“To be honest, I love them. Dogs are such wonderful creatures. They love you no matter what. That’s hard to find.”
“Let me get a cab.” There were none in sight. While they waited at the curb, a policeman began to cross the street and headed toward them. Allen shoved his hand into his pockets and quietly asked, “Would you take my arm?”
Mel did not realize what was happening but did what he had asked. It was then that she noticed the officer. Mel laid her head on his shoulder and focused her gaze on a couple window shopping across the street. Once he had passed, she removed her arm from his. “I hate that fucking shit,” she hissed. Allen looked down at her face. Her eyes were blazing. He waved down an approaching cab, and they piled in.
“You can’t let it get to you,” he said in a matter-of fact kind of way. He turned his attention to the cabbie and said, “West Central Park and 69th.” This time, she accepted when he offered a cigarette.
Pulling her hair back, she leaned into the lighter’s flame. She sighed. “I’m not able to pay for anything, and it’s driving me nuts. I’m embarrassed,” and sighed again. “As soon as I…”
“Later, OK?” he asked and patted her hand.
She could not help but look up at all the high-reaching buildings that stood in Manhattan. “I can never get over just how immense this place is.” Her head was just about upside down, trying to get the best possible view.
“Yes. You are adorable.” She didn’t hear him. The city and all its energy had her full attention. Allen turned to the gorgeous driver. When they arrived at his address, the cabbie thanked Allen for the tip. He also handed him a slip of paper with his name and number on it.
Allen just smiled and put it in his pocket.
A uniformed doorman held open the heavy glass door. “Good afternoon, Mr. Shandi.”
“Hey there, George. How are Christina and the baby?”
“They are wonderful, thanks for asking.”
“Come on. You must have a picture, yes?”
With that, George pulled his wallet out of his pocket and opened it to a photo.
“Oh,” Allen said with a sigh. “Oh my gosh. They are lovely. Is Penelope about four months old now? Look at these beautiful women, Mel.”
She took the wallet. The woman in the photo looked thrilled to be a mom. Little Penelope’s toothless grin was precious. “You are a very lucky man,” she said placing her hand on her abdomen. Still smiling, she handed it back to him.
“Yes, I am.” George took a few seconds to look at the picture before putting it away.
“By the way, Christopher has taken Daphne for a walk.”
Allen gave him a wink. “Thanks, George.”
The elevator required a unique key to go to the penthouse. Mel and Allen rode it nine floors up. When the elevator doors opened, they stepped into a small area with a large door across the way. He opened it and they entered an extravagant vestibule. Mel had never seen or could even imagine such wealth. An older gentleman greeted Allen with his mail and messages.
He looked inquisitively at Melanie.
Allen said, “This is my sweet friend, Melanie. Mel, this is Quinten. If you need or want anything, this is your man.”
Mel extended her hand out to Quinten and said, “Nice to meet you.” He hesitated and looked at Allen. Allen grinned.
He took her hand and said, “It’s very nice to meet you. Would you prefer Mel or Melanie?”
“Either is fine. May I use the bathroom?”
“Of course, follow me, please.”
The bathroom was straight ahead and to the right. It was below a winding staircase with full bookshelves. Quinten lightly pressed the spine of a red and black book, and a door opened outward. Orange-yellow light spilled out onto the tiled floor.
“I’ve never actually seen a secret door. Very cool! Thank you,” she said and went inside. The dominant color was red, and the accent colors were black, gold and purple. Tiles of red with gold swirls outlined in black covered the bottom half of the walls. The upper half was crimson. She was sure the entire room was larger than her apartment. There were several black and red velvet ottomans and a purple and gold chaise lounge in a sitting area. On the other side of a half wall was the toilet and a bidet alongside it. Over the double sinks hung an enormous mirror with an ornate frame. She set her bag on the black marble counter between the sinks. As she sat on the toilet, she tried to take all of it in. “And this is just the bathroom,” she whispered. Once she’d finished, she washed her hands and raked her fingers through her hair.
Allen was waiting for her. “I’d like to show you something.” They went up the stairs and off to the left. After passing several rooms, Allen held open the door to a bedroom. She flashed him a confused expression.
“Oh! No. This isn’t one of those ‘I’d like to show you my etchings’ snares. I wanted to show you a few things from my collection. It’s through the doorway on the left.”
She did not budge. “Wait here,” he said and disappeared into that room. As he came back, he draped pieces of clothing on hangers across the bed. Spreading them out, he chose a backless sequin-covered halter top jumpsuit in champagne gold. “Isn’t this scrumptious?”
“It’s dazzling. But it’s not my style.”
He looked at the remainder of what was on the bed. “That’s the second time you’ve mentioned your style. What is your style, exactly?”
“I like a less feminine look, you know? I’ve always been a tomboy,” she said timidly. “Do you design things for men?”
The sound of quickly clicking toenails on the wood floor grew louder. With that, a magnificent Rottweiler burst into the room. “Daphne-love!” gushed Allen.
Catching his breath, Christopher followed. He stood over six feet tall, blonde hair parted on the right and trimmed with precision. Although he was slender, he was muscular the way 20-year-old men often are. “I’m back from our daily tug. She is going to pull my arm out one of these days,” he said.
Daphne’s interest shifted to the new scent in the room. Her full tail swished back and forth as she sniffed Mel’s feet and legs.
“Who is this?” Christopher asked, inspecting Mel.
She stuck out her hand, “I’m Mel Foster.” He hesitated for a moment, then took her hand. “It’s very nice to meet you,” she said. Still looking at Christopher, she asked, “Daphne’s tail is intact? I don’t think I’ve ever seen that. She’s a beauty.”
“We got her when she was a pup, and we specifically told them not to do that. It’s unthinkable,” Allen huffed.
Mel was on her knees, along with Christopher, cuddling and scratching her belly. “We had a large dog when I was little. Just a mutt, but at least 100 pounds. My father found a harness for her and it helped when we had to walk her.” Daphne jumped onto Mel knocking her back with her legs folded under her and began licking her face. Mel laughed and hugged her around the neck.
“Daphne!” Allen laughed. “Come! Come here, my girl.” She obediently went to his side.
“May I have a washcloth or something?” Mel asked once Allen had lured Daphne away.
Christopher answered, “Sure.” Mel followed him out of the bedroom and down the hall.
“Second door on the left,” he said with a forced smile.
She pushed the door, but it did not close all the way. Splashing her face with warm soap and water removed the drool from her face. Two black velvet ottomans placed side by side with a tiny table between were in the corner. She sat and took advantage of the small, crystal ashtray. Digging through her bag, she retrieved her last cigarette, matches and a hair clip. Taking a deep drag, she grabbed everything and went to the mirror. With the cigarette hanging from her mouth, she pulled her thick hair and piled it on the crown of her head. The extra-large leather slide barely fit over her mop of curls. She pushed the stick through the holes to secure everything in place. Invariably, five or six tendrils hung down around her neck, dripping down over her back and shoulders. She could hear a discussion growing louder coming from the bedroom. “She will end up becoming just another fag-hag for you. What is this, the fifth? I do not need yet another person hanging around watching us as if you and I were a freakshow,” Christopher said firmly.
“You are wrong about her. She’s one of us. Her ideas about women’s clothing are perfect for what’s down the road,” said Allen.
“Is that how you met her?” There was a pause.
Trying to make her presence known, Mel tugged the door open and stomped heavily onto the floor. Daphne flounced toward her. “I’m going to have to get going, little girl.” Holding either side of her enormous head, she kissed her loudly.
“Your hair. I love it!” declared Allen. “I have a proposal for you, Mel. You brought up a more masculine feel for women’s clothing. Would you help me bring that idea to life?” Allen asked.
“I don’t know the first thing about fashion.”
Christopher laughed, “You’ve got that right.”
“Now, now. Let’s not be bitchy,” said Allen.
Mel motioned toward Christopher while looking at Allen and said, “He understands that I do not…”
“Sometimes, all you need to know is what you like and what you don’t like,” said Allen. “Like art.” He grabbed her hand and led her to the back of the bedroom. After opening the double-door walk-in closet, he began to look through his clothes. He chose a white button-down shirt from his closet. “What would you do with this?” He held it out to her. His right arm was across his chest and was clutching his left bicep. His forearm extended outward with the palm of his hand facing the ceiling, and the shirt dangled from his fingertip. She would come to know this as his “What say you?” pose.
“Seriously?” She exhaled. Taking the shirt from him, she hung it from an indentation on one of the columns of the four-poster bed. Christopher gasped at the thought of damage done to the tiger maple column. “I would make it sleeveless and shorten the front to waist length.” She turned it around. Christopher stepped in and held it for her. “Thanks, Christopher. It could be darted a bit to fit my form, then lengthened the shirttail to fall just passed the…” she patted her rear.
“Ass?” Christopher asked. Allen gave him a look.
“Well, I was gonna say cheeks, but either fit. Split it up the middle to about two inches below the waistline. It would end up kind of like tails on a tux. If you could give it lapels rather than a collar, I think that would be something I’d like.”
“What would you wear with it?” asked Allen.
Taking a moment to think, she finally said, “I would wear straight leg jeans and man boots up to my knees. You know, the kind that you tie up in the front without the spiky heels.”
Allen looked over at Christopher and said, “Do you see what I mean?”
“Do you design clothes also, Christopher?”
He seemed insulted by the question. “I am a model,” he answered in a sharp tone.
“I’m sorry. I don’t read many magazines.” Pointing out her appearance with gesturing hands, she laughed, “Just look at me for crying out loud!”
“I have to give you that,” Christopher said.
“Honey, that’s not…” Allen started to say.
“But it’s funny and appropriate,” answered Mel. “Allen, thanks for all of this. I’ve got to get going.”
A nearly palpable look went from Allen to Christopher. Christopher shrugged his shoulders and said, “OK,” and he left the room.
“This might be forward, but I…we wondered if you would consider staying with us while we take Cleo in this new direction? This place has several empty rooms. But I think you’d truly love the one on the far end.”
“But I haven’t agreed to the clothing thing.”
He ignored her. She followed him to an enormous room down the hallway. Daphne’s toenails let them know she was right behind them. Everything was covered with sheets except the king-size bed. Sliding glass doors on the far side of the room led to a balcony complete with greenery and furniture. The walls were white, and the furniture was in varying shades of red. As the sun fell low in the sky, it cast a fantastic orangey-pink over everything around her, including Allen.
“Isn’t it gorgeous?”
“Yes, but I have a job,” she said.
He came toward her and held her by the shoulders. “This is an opportunity to grow. It will be your job. Name your price.” She was only aware of his hands on her. Everything else was a blur. “Please?” he asked, batting his eyes again. Allen bent down a bit to meet her eye and was inches from her face. “I need you.”
She paused, then finally said, “Yes. Thank you. Allen, I am so grateful…” but the lump in her throat and tears squelched her ability to speak.
Allen threw his arms around her and she pulled away just a bit. He laughed and said, “I’m sorry. I excite easily!”
“Good to know,” she said, patting him on the back. He laughed into her ear. The sensation of his breath on her neck was incredible and alarming at once. “I have one request.”
“Name it.”
She pulled back and placed her hands on his chest. “I am not a huggee, cuddly, touchy-feely person. Please, don’t take it the wrong way. You are such a great guy, a real gentleman. You would never deliberately hurt anyone. It just makes me uncomfortable.”
He looked into her eyes. “Of course, I can respect that.” He backed away. “I understand, you know. Maybe better than most. I was different, too.” She felt light-headed.
“Are you alright?” he asked.
“Yes. I think I need a shower and a good night’s sleep.”
“Can I have Quinten bring you a bite to eat?”
“No, not right now. If I get hungry, I’ll poke around the kitchen, if that’s OK.”
“It’s fine with me, but Quinten gets a bit touchy when his domain is disturbed.”
“I promise I’ll clean up after myself,” she offered.
“Good Lord, woman, I was joking! Feel free to have anything you’d like.” He left her room and closed the door behind him.
Chapter 3
By the next morning, all of Mel’s belongings had been picked up and delivered to the penthouse. That afternoon, Allen purchased a month’s worth of clothing for her right down to her panties, along with a carton of her favorite cigarettes plus several joints. She sat on the edge of the bed surrounded by all of it, including the jelly jar she’d given to Fred and her prized possession. It was an old lockbox. Taking the key out of her bag, she placed the box on her lap and opened it slowly. Lifting the three photographs of her brother, Benjamin, from inside, she traced his face with her finger. It also contained a spool of fishing line. She looked up to see Allen standing in the doorway. She closed the box and set it aside.
“Would you like a hand putting things away?” he asked.
“I can’t accept all of this.”
“Consider it an advance,” he said. “Anything you dislike will be returned, exchanged, whatever.” He walked toward her.
Mel stood and moved toward the middle of the room. “You could have let my friend keep the glass,” she remarked.
“I did something a little better, I think. I hope you agree. Fred now occupies your old apartment, and I’ve paid up for two years. He has several new outfits, a bit of cash, and will be filling in at your old job until you decide what you want to do. I will find another place for you to live if you think this isn’t working out, but I want you to share your ideas with me,” he said in a serious tone.
She turned away from him. “I’m going to do my very best for you. Thank you for giving me this chance.”
He moved toward her, then thought better of it. Quinten knocked on the door frame.
“Excuse me, Sir. How many for dinner tonight?”
“Six, I think. Very casual, OK?” Allen asked.
“Time?”
“Six-thirty.”
“Is there anything, in particular, you would like tonight, Sir?”
“Mel, if you sat down in a restaurant and could have anything you wanted, what would it be?” Allen asked her.
She chuckled. “I feel as if I’m in a dream, or I’m high. Maybe I’ve died and gone to Heaven.” She asked timidly, “Do you like spaghetti and meatballs and maybe a salad?”
“Perfect. Is that doable, Quinten?”
“Of course, Sir. Can I get you anything in the meantime, Miss Melanie?”
“No thanks, and for God’s sake, drop the Miss. You make me feel as if I’m the character in ‘Gone with the Wind’! Or worse, my mother.”
“Quinten, could you give us a minute?”
“Of course,” he said and went downstairs.
Allen sat on the bench at the foot of the bed. His legs crossed at the knee and leaning back on his hands. “Did I tell you how I ended up living here?” he asked Mel. She shook her head, no. He gestured with his hand for her to sit next to him. She sat beside him with her legs apart, her elbows resting on her thighs and hands folded. He brushed her hair over her shoulder.
“I just want to see your face, OK?”
“Yes,” she answered and looked at him.
“My father owned an oil conglomerate. It doesn’t matter which one. They are all greed-factories. He could buy and sell God, or so he said. The best part is that God got the last laugh. One morning he told his secretary that there were to be no phone calls, no interruptions. He had a massive heart attack at his desk while she typed away just outside his door. Side note, she was also his mistress. An hour and a half later, she poked her head in to ask a question. She found him sweat-soaked and face down in a pool of his vomit. The Man upstairs is a funny guy, don’t you agree?”
“I gather you were not close to him?”
“No one was. My father loved money and fucking women. If he could have figured out a way to bang them with a roll of hundreds on his cock, it would have been his ejaculation of a lifetime.”
“Wow,” she chuckled. “How did your mom take it?”
“Poor thing, she loved him and not for his money. She would tell me about the 19-year-old boy she’d met all those years ago. Generous, kind, hardworking and very gentle with her. Somewhere along the line, he soured. He began drinking to excess and worse, hitting her. He became ruthless.”
“Did he know you are gay?”
“I think if he’d spent just a bit of time with me, he would have. But you must be in the same room with a person, look into their eyes, listen to what they say to learn anything. My wonderful mother died two years after my father. Countless homes, cars, all kinds of ‘things’ had become the property of my brother and me. Did I tell you I have a brother? Keith. Funny guy. A good man. Anyway. He and I sold most of it and gave the money to charities for the homeless, hospitals, but the best was handing out money to anyone that looked like they could use it. We knew this would make the old bastard roll in his grave. Even better, we made the donations in his name.”
“Ooooh, you scoundrels. I love it,” she laughed.
“Quinten has been with our family since before I was born. He is an old-fashioned gentleman’s gentleman. He just can’t help himself. I know for certain there were times that he would intercept when that bastard was after my mom. He’d lie and say there was a phone call or news on TV about my father’s company. My father was so drunk he probably could have distracted him with a ring of keys, …like an infant. All that being said, Quinten is who he is, and we accept him that way. Alright?”
Her face was beet red. “Yes. Understood. I’ll make it right.” She looked back on the bed and asked, “I hate to sound like such a girl, but what are you wearing tonight?”
Allen laughed. “How do jeans and a shirt sound? Shoes are optional.”
“Comfortable, thank you.”
Allen’s chef, Wyatt Edmonds, had taken the time to ask Mel about her selection for dinner, right down to the amount of garlic or basil. He stood at six foot four and two hundred forty pounds of muscle. He looked extremely intimidating, but that turned out to be completely wrong. He was a gentle and soft-spoken man. It was moving to see his interest in what would make her happy.
That evening, softly playing jazz hung in the background. Allen and Christopher were in one of two black loveseats in a cozy area of the living room. The other loveseat was directly across from them, with two red high-back chairs between them facing the fireplace. A black lacquered coffee table sat between it all.
The first to arrive were two women that worked in the garment district. Eric had red cropped hair and was wearing a man’s blue button-down shirt tucked into her black jeans with a matching blue belt and sneakers.
Mel asked Eric, “May I ask, do you consider yourself a ‘he’ or ‘she’?”
“He, and thank you for asking.” His girlfriend, Meghan also had red hair, but shoulder length. She wore a short denim skirt, a red sweater and black high heels. After the introductions, Allen offered drinks. Eric would have his usual Pabst Blue Ribbon beer in a pint glass while Meghan preferred white wine. Rather than help, Christopher called out for a vodka and tonic. As Allen gave Eric and Meghan their drinks, he heard the elevator door open and excused himself. Mel went to the bar to make Christopher’s drink. She brought it to him and asked, “What do you think Allen will have?”
“I have no idea,” he answered, not meeting her eyes.
“Mel, meet Zora Preston. She is a buyer for one of the high-end stores on 5th Avenue. Zora, Mel Foster.”
She was a tall, curvy African American woman with a beautiful, giant Afro. She wore a tight-fitting, sleeveless black turtleneck sweater, large gold hoop earrings and a floor-length striped skirt in all the colors of the rainbow. Mel smiled and shook her hand. “Do you prefer Mel or Melanie?” Zora asked in a soft and sexy voice.
“Either is fine.”
“Then, Melanie, it is.”
“Your hair is gorgeous!” Mel gushed.
“As is yours,” she responded, taking a handful and twirling it between her fingers.
“I told her just how beautiful you are, Mel. And did I lie?” Allen asked, holding his hands to her like the statuesque women on game shows would when displaying a new car.
Mel became an entirely new shade of red. “Allen, please.” She laughed and turned to Zora. “If you know Allen at all, then you know how generous he is with his compliments. Zora, what can I get you to drink?”
“I’ll have whatever you’re having,” she smiled, putting her hand on top of Mel’s. The sound of ice cubes clinking together came from Christopher. He’d raised his glass and shook it. Allen snatched it from his hand, then he and Mel went to the bar.
“What’s going on, Allen?”
“I’m sorry for Christopher’s behavior.”
“That’s not what I meant. Why is Zora here?”
“I thought the two of you might hit it off,” he said innocently.
“Oh, good Christ,” she said, leaning on the marble surface. She closed her eyes and said, “Are you under the impression that I am a lesbian?”
“Well, yes.”
“Oh, my God,” she whispered, then laughed. “I can’t be upset with you. A tomboy is a stone’s throw from that. No, I’m not a lesbian. This beautiful woman was brought here as my date?”
“I am so sorry,” he said, thoroughly embarrassed. “Let me talk to Zora.”
“No. That’s OK. Let me,” Mel said. After handing Christopher his drink, she asked, “Zora, would you mind checking out the wine selections?”
“Not at all.”
Allen watched out of the corner of his eye as Mel placed her hand on Zora’s back. Mel smiled at her and spoke softly. A look of confusion came across Zora’s face as Mel spoke but quickly changed to a warm smile. Zora placed her hand on Mel’s. She kissed her on the forehead and, with her thumb, wiped the lipstick it left behind. Their attention turned to the wine. Mel laughed loudly at something Zora said. Christopher smirked at Mel. “Idiot,” he said under his breath. Allen shot him a look.
The evening continued as if nothing had happened. The dining room table was set, complete with two flower arrangements. Allen and Christopher sat at opposite ends of the table. Eric and Meghan sat on one side and Mel and Zora on the other.
Mel asked Eric, “How long have you two been together?”
Eric lifted Meghan’s hand from under the table and kissed it. “Two years. The first time I saw Meghan, I was hooked. I couldn’t take my eyes off her. Then she turned and looked at me and smiled. I couldn’t believe it. Everything came into focus. People say things like the sky is bluer, the birds sing more sweetly, and that is the truth. She was just what I needed in my life,” Eric said and leaned in for a kiss.

Love All the Way
3 ratings","Melanie, a fiery young woman, meets Allen when she saves him from being beaten up because he is gay. The two of them form a strong friendship. Melanie is deeply in love with Allen, although she knows that Allen will never be able to love her that way. The two also begin working together because Allen is a wealthy fashion designer, and Melanie has an eye for fashion. However, when Allen is diagnosed with ALS, a degenerative disease with no cure, both of their lives change. Love All the Way by Aurora Carafa tells the story of love and loss and shows that unconventional love is still love. I enjoyed the excellent characterization in this book. As Allen comes to an understanding of how his disease will impact him, he never wants to be a burden on the people in his life. He wants nothing more than to be able to care for those around him. I also appreciated how Melanie struggled with her feelings for Allen. She respected his sexuality but still loved him. However, she still wanted nothing but the best for him, regardless of her emotions. I also respected Melanie for the fierce manner in which she defended those in her life. The overall writing style was excellent as well. There were a few minor errors throughout the book, but overall, the book was well-edited. This book is full of deeply emotional events, and Carafa was able to portray those emotions viscerally. As a reader, I was able to understand the pain of Allen and those in his life. I rate Love All the Way 5 out of 5 stars. There was nothing that I disliked about it. The characters showed great depth, and the plot was driven by deep-seated emotions. This book is perfect for mature audiences who enjoy romance novels that feature unconventional relationships. It does contain strong language and sexual content, so sensitive audiences should keep that in mind. Otherwise, I highly recommend Love All the Way!"

PART ONE — HER STYLE
Chapter 1—September 6th, 1972
The night breeze was a welcome sensation after spending six hours working up a sweat cleaning one of the NYU buildings off Washington Square. This seedy side of town always put Melanie on edge. The drenched bandana covering her hair would stay in place until she was safely back in her room. Reaching into her purple bag, she found her keys. Before putting one foot on the sidewalk, she made sure the keys were spread apart and protruding between her fingers.
The walk to the Village Plaza Hotel took as long as smoking one cigarette, three quarters if she was nervous. Three drags in, she heard a low, angry voice. A lighter voice responded as if confused. In the darkness of a doorway off to the left, Melanie could make out a large man hanging over a smaller person.
“Faggot, yer gonna get yer fuckin’ ass kicked,” he growled while raising his massive fist back over his shoulder. It was then that Mel realized the smaller person was a man trying to cover his head with his hands.
Quickly, she stepped toward them. “Honey, where have you been?” she asked, pulling the bandana off her head. The growler, still clenching his fist, turned to look at her. For just a few seconds, he stared at her. Her dirty bell-bottoms and loosely fitting t-shirt covering her slender body did not distract him from the long, curly-cue, strawberry blonde hair that framed her beautiful face and fell to her elbows. With one hand on her hip, she flicked the cigarette to the side. For a fleeting moment, the only sounds were a few crickets communicating with each other. She took that time to smile and step toward him. When she was close enough to see him begin to smile back, her right arm swung around, connecting with his left cheek and eye. The punch itself was not remarkable, but the keys split his face and it had begun to bleed. He lost his balance just enough to allow her to finish the job by kneeing him in the groin. He yelped in pain as he fell over, clutching his crotch. Placing her arm under the light voiced man’s arm, she brought him to his feet.
All he could do was stare at her. Not for her hair and sweet face, but because he was dumbstruck. He’d seen only one other woman fight like that.
Grabbing his hand, they ran down Washington Place. Twice, she looked back to see if the beast was behind them. Tugging him to the right, they ran into the hotel. The man behind the desk in the lobby yelled, “Where are you going?”
“It’s me, Melanie, Mr. Jones.” The three flights of stairs took the last of her energy. Looking back over her shoulder, she felt a little safer. She had not let go of his hand. At times, he’d run right beside her, others ahead of her. They stopped on the third floor. She let go of him and bent over, hands on her knees, trying to catch her breath. With a sweeping motion, she tossed her hair back and stood upright. In front of her darkened doorway, she finally looked over at him. Once her eyes adjusted to the light, she saw his face. In the shadows of a dimly lit bare bulb screwed into the ceiling, she could see his smile. He leaned against the wall with his hand shaking against his chest.
“You’ll be OK,” she tried to say in a calm voice.
His long, dark brown, shiny hair fell in layers just below his shoulders. A pair of Aviator prescription glasses rested on his significant and masculine nose. Eyeliner enhanced his almond-shaped brown eyes and long lashes. Her eyes fell to his mouth, and she couldn’t help but stare at his lips. They were the kind that made women jealous. Both the top and bottom were full. The deep dimples were like perpetual parentheses on the edges of that extraordinary mouth. Once he stood up straight, Melanie guessed he was only a few inches taller than her, putting him at about 5’11”. A bead of blood rolled down over his eyelid.
“Looks like he got a punch in.” She handed him a tissue from her bag, put her blood-covered door key in the worn lock and opened it. He followed her inside.
The kitchen was no more than an area in the otherwise Lilliputian room. She pulled the only chair from the tiny table and motioned for him to sit.
“What’s your name?” she asked as she rinsed off her keys.
“Allen. Shandi.”
She smiled. “Like the beer?”
“No,” he smiled, “as in boisterous.” He looked around the room. It was shabby but clean. Not like anything he’d ever experienced. “And what is your name? I heard you say, ‘Melanie.’”
“Yeah. Melanie. Mel. Foster.”
“As in cultivate?”
“Nah. Like the Grant’s.”
His laugh was light and feminine. Mel pulled a small container from under the twin bed and put it on the threadbare rug next to him. Inside was an assortment of necessities. It contained a sewing needle stuck in a spool of white thread, a hammer, a box of band-aids, a roll of tape, and a small glass container of hydrogen peroxide. She retrieved a band-aid and the bottle.
“Would you take off your glasses, please?”
“Truth be told, my vision is horrible. I can only see about a foot in front of me without them,” he told her.
“I’d like to clean out that cut. That bastard was filthy. It wouldn’t surprise me if you caught something just by breathing in the same space as that creep did. Your glasses could use a wipe, too.” He removed them and tilted his head towards her. “This might sting a bit,” Mel warned. She lifted his thick hair away from his forehead. The aroma of pot and sandalwood floated up to her and it made her smile. She lightly patted his head with a paper towel with the tiniest bit of hydrogen peroxide.
“Jesus!” He winced.
“I’m sorry,” she said, and blew on the cut.
“I haven’t thanked you for saving me from that Neanderthal. What would ever make you go after something that size?”
She paused. “The ‘f’ word.”
“Fuck?”
“Faggot.” The very word made her purse her lips. “May I have your glasses?” She took them, gave them a quick cleaning on her shirt, and held them out to him.
He reached for her hand holding the paper towel, but she quickly pulled away. He was startled by her reaction. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean anything by it,” he said. “I should go. Thank you for your care and time.” He put his glasses back on, then got up and walked to the door.
She was still holding the bloodied paper towel as he closed the door behind him. Her head fell back. “Oh, good Christ,” she said, disappointed in herself. “Let it go!” she whispered.
Once she’d quickly washed the dirty coffee cup from that morning and rinsed herself off in front of the sink, she fell onto the bed. The sounds of New York City outside her window had finally become familiar to her. That was not what kept her from relaxing. The image of his face kept returning to her. Allen was beautiful. He’s gay. She punched her pillow in hopes of making it more comfortable and closed her eyes. Tomorrow is Saturday. She began a mental list of things to do. Things like laundry and groceries and such needed to be done. But then, she heard his laugh in her head. Her eyes opened, and she sighed. There will not be much in the way of sleep tonight. “Happy birthday to me,” she whispered.
Chapter 2
It was nearly noon when she opened her eyes. A light knock on the door startled her. She jumped out of bed and put on her robe.
“Who’s there?”
“I have a delivery for Miss Grant,” a deep voice said.
“Miss Grant?” she whispered, and then it clicked. “Hold on.” Grabbing her bag off the floor, she searched inside until she found a quarter at the bottom. Pulling the door open just a crack, she could see an enormous assortment of purple and white flowers. She opened it wide enough to take them. Slowly, the bouquet lowered, and Allen’s eyes came into view. He playfully batted them at her.
She laughed. “What’s this?”
“It’s just a modest gift in appreciation of your bravery. Also…” He handed her a large, beautifully wrapped box. She took it from him.
“Come on in, please. You didn’t have to do this.”
He placed the flowers on the tiny table, then turned to her. After adjusting his glasses against his nose, Allen stood with his hands behind his back. His skin-tight, shiny black jeans flared out into a modest bell. The shoes looked like women’s leather square-toed chunky-heeled pumps, but he made them look great. The tan tank top was sheer enough that the hair on his chest and the outline of his nipples were evident. Around his neck he wore a slender black leather tie that was loosened and hung low on his chest. The knot itself was strange. A black silk scarf was wrapped several times around his left wrist and tied, leaving the ends hanging about six inches.
She sat on the bed, pulled off the wrapping, and lifted the lid. Inside was a proper first aid kit, a sewing kit complete with scissors, and a few smaller tools complete with two kinds of screwdrivers, a tape measure, pliers and an adjustable wrench.
“This is too much!”
He sat near her and took out an ‘L’ shaped piece of metal and examined it. “What is this?”
“It’s an Allen wrench,” she laughed. His smile disappeared, and he placed it back in the box. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to….” Tentatively, she patted his shoulder and rose from the bed. “Would you like a cup of coffee? All I have is instant.” She clutched her robe at the neck and started to open one of the two cabinets.
“I was hoping I could take you out for a bite. It’s a lovely day. We could walk a bit if you’d like.” Mel did not answer. “We could take a cab if you prefer.”
“I…I don’t have any clean clothes. Today is laundry day for me. Can I take a raincheck?” she finally asked, not meeting his eye as her face reddened.
“Well, this is all too perfect! How long will it take for you to put on whatever you would have worn to the laundromat? In 15 minutes, I’ll have a cab out front, alright?”
“I don’t…”
“Please?” He held out his hand. She looked down, smiled and swatted her fingertips with his.
“Alright, then. Meet me outside in fifteen minutes,” Allen said with a smile. Just before he closed the door, he looked back at her, flashed that incredible smile again, and gave a quick nod in a way that somehow relaxed any of her suspicious feelings.
She lifted a pair of hip huggers from the top of a pile of clothes in her closet and shook them out. Her only clean shirt was a lilac sleeveless turtleneck her brother made for her. She brushed her teeth with one hand and ran her fingers through her thick hair with the other. Laying out two pieces of bread on the counter, she assembled a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. She rinsed out the paper coffee cup she’d saved from the day before and filled it with milk. The lid still fit. There were far too many beautiful flowers in her bouquet not to share. She chose three cosmoses, cut the stems, and set them in a little water-filled jelly jar. Splashing water on her face, she looked at her reflection in the aged mirror on the wall. As ready as I’ll ever be. Taking a deep breath, Melanie slung her bag over her shoulder. She tried to walk calmly down the three flights of stairs.
Through the dirty front door window, she could see Allen leaning on a cab, chatting with the driver. Just then, a tall blonde man walked by them. Both heads swiveled, taking a long look at his ass. She had to chuckle.
“I’d check that out myself,” she whispered.
The day was quite a bit cooler than the day before. Allen took a cigarette from his pocket, along with a gold lighter. As he lit up, he saw Melanie walking toward him. She turned to the homeless man sitting up against the building. “Fred, here’s a little something to eat. Would you save me the glass?” He reached out for the paper bag and cup. With his free hand, he took hers and kissed it. Mumbling something unintelligible to her, she smiled and gave him the flowers.
He placed them up against his leg, cupped his hand around the glass and admired his gift.
A breeze drifted down the street. Melanie’s nipples shriveled from the cold air. Her knee-jerk reaction was to draw her arms up to her chest. Allen noticed and immediately felt embarrassed for her.
A policeman walked by them and stopped to observe Allen. He grabbed Mel’s hand, opened the door to the cab, and helped her in. Walking to the other side, Allen kept an eye on him. He tipped an imaginary cap to the officer and climbed inside. “Broome and Mercer,” he directed and turned to her. “You are adorable!” he said, smiling at Mel. The cabbie stared at him through the rearview mirror.
“Where were you coming from last night?” he asked her.
“My job. I didn’t ask you how your head is.”
He smiled. “It’s fine. Where do you work?”
“In the evenings, I clean some of the buildings at NYU.” She lifted his hair away from the cut. Clicking her tongue at the sight of the half dollar sized bruise developing, she asked, “Did you ice this?”
“No. How old are you?”
“20. And you?”
“24. Where are you from originally?”
“Upstate New York. A tiny town no one’s ever heard of.”
“Is that where you learned to fight?” he asked with a smile.
The color seemed to drain from her face. A silence hung between them until the cab hit a pothole that sent them both leaning hard to the right. She caught Allen as he fell against her.
Her loud, nervous laugh made its debut, and it certainly could draw attention.
“Oh my! Well, I love that sound!” he said.
The cab pulled over and made a hard stop. “Broome and Mercer, Mr. Shandi.” Allen’s tight pants forced him to lean to the left awkwardly. Jamming his right hand in his front pocket, he retrieved a bundle of bills. Mel glanced down at his hands. The bulge to the left of the bottom of his zipper caught her off guard. She very quickly looked away. He gave the cabbie a $5 tip.
“Thank you, Mr. Shandi!” His hand began to tremble as he put his money away. She took notice, and he caught that. He exited, went to her side of the cab and opened the door. Offering her his left hand, he helped her climb out.
“Are you hungry? I’m hungry. Let’s get lunch. My treat,” he said, looking across the street. He grabbed her hand and they sprinted through the traffic. Horns began honking, and a few cars stopped short. He held his hand up in a thanks gesture. She loved the way his hair bounced as he trotted. They entered a narrow eatery. A decidedly gay man welcomed Allen.
“Mr. Shandi, it’s so good to see you again. Your table is ready.” Other couples that had been waiting were not regulars or did not carry the same weight as Allen. She did not know what to make of this.
They were seated across from one another in a dark and quiet corner. Paper menus were brought to the table by a pretty young lady. “What can I get you to drink, Mr. Shandi?” she asked in a coquettish manner. She reached past Melanie’s face to light the candle and replaced the dirty ashtray with a clean one.
“What would you like, Mel?”
No one had called her that in at least five years.
“Coffee please, with milk?” she asked, looking at the waitress.
“I’ll have the same.”
The waitress placed her hand on his shoulder and said, “You’ve got it, Honey.” She walked away with quite a sway in her hips. Mel grinned and looked over to see Allen reaching for her over the table. He took a lock of her curly hair and rolled it between his fingers.
“If mermaids were real, this is the kind of hair they would have.”
She laughed as her face turned red. “Wow. I’ve never heard that before.” The art that was curiously placed up against the wall caught her eye. One piece in particular stood out. “Take a peek at that one! It’s a kaleidoscope!” She turned her attention back to his face. He’d been staring at her. Feeling embarrassed, she pretended to go over the menu. “Where are you from?” Mel asked.
“I’m not an interesting person,” he said while lighting a cigarette. “Would you like one?” he offered.
“No, thanks. I don’t want to hear your deepest, darkest secrets. How about, what do you do for a living? I feel like I’m the only one not in on it. Everybody knows you. I’ve lived here for five months, and I have no idea what you do or why you are so,” she paused, “beloved.”
“Beloved. That’s interesting.” He propped up his elbow on the table, and he rested his chin in his hand. The smoke from his cigarette curled up around his face. She sat back in the chair and crossed her ankle over her knee. Lacing her fingers together, she rested her hands in her lap. Giving him an “I’ve got all day” look, she took a deep breath.
Tapping his cigarette on the ashtray, he asked, “Have you ever heard of a clothing line called ‘Cleo’?”
“Yes. Do you work for her?”
“Well, I am her, so to speak. I named it after a knot I created for a necktie.” He pointed to the one that hung from his neck. It almost appeared to be a braid, and yet it was not. “The business has been open for three and a half years. It was perfect timing for my vision of what young women wanted. And the rest as they say…” he laughed, waving his cigarette in the air.
The waitress returned with the coffee. “Have you decided what you’d like to eat?” she asked, staring directly at Allen.
“Not really. Can we have a few more minutes?”
“Sure, Honey,” she answered and sashayed away, stopping once to look over her shoulder at Allen. But his thoughts were elsewhere.
“Have you always known you were…a visionary?” Mel asked as she stirred her coffee.
Allen glanced around to see if anyone was within earshot. He whispered, “What exactly are you asking?”
“My brother made this top for me. Not really my style, but he made it with love.” She gently touched the gauzy fabric around her neck. “Ben knew he was gay from the time he was a little boy,” Mel said softly. Her eyes welled up. “My mother simply ignored that fact. My father had an altogether different take on Ben. The things he would punish him for, well, it would just break your heart. That bastard took off in 1965. Good riddance.”
“Where is Ben now?”
“Buried in the Oswegatchie Cemetery outside of Fine, NY. Fine, NY! Funny, huh?” she laughed to cover the sadness.
More customers had begun to fill the place. The waitress returned once more. “What will it be?” she asked.
“Mel?” he asked.
She kept her head down and asked, “May I have a burger?” A tear rolled down her nose and fell on the menu.
“I’ll have the same,” he said. The waitress jotted it down as she walked away.
He gave Mel his napkin. “Dry your eyes, Sweetness,” then moved to a chair next to her and put his arm around her shoulders. “There are souls that are just too beautiful for this world,” he whispered in her ear. She had thought the very same thing a thousand times.
Two gay teens cautiously approached the table. Mel looked up. “Your fans, Mr. S! If you’ll excuse me…” The young men nearly levitated over a chance to chat with Allen. He watched her walk through a narrow doorway and into the restroom.
Splashing a little water on her face, she looked at her reflection. Her hands gripped the sides of the sink. “Pull it together,” she whispered to herself. Once she’d collected herself with a few deep breaths, she headed back to the table. She stopped and watched Allen as he spoke to them. He listened carefully as they replied and talked about their dreams.
Allen was leaning forward, elbows on his knees and speaking softly. He was incredibly patient as he explained what it took to get where he was. His enormous smile was evidence that he seemed to enjoy this part of his celebrity.
She leaned against the door frame, legs crossed at the ankles, her arms crossed just below her chest.
The two teens stood close to each other. For a second, their pinkies hooked together. Allen grinned. Removing the scarf from his wrist, he tied it around the wrist of the young man on the left, then lifted the tie from his neck and put it on the other fan. He held out his hand to shake theirs.
An older couple seated at a nearby table shook their heads in disapproval. Mel stood and stared at them for a moment, then turned her back and obstructed their view. The boys practically pogoed over to her.
“Johnny, isn’t he amazing?” the shorter of the two asked his boyfriend.
He grinned at Mel and said, “He’s amazing!”
“He certainly is,” she replied. The boys left overwhelmed with joy about what had just happened.
The burgers arrived at the table as Mel sat back down. “Thank you,” she said to the waitress and tried to make eye contact.
Finally, she looked at Mel and said, “You’re welcome.”
“Those kids will be living on that for a long time. That’s just about the sweetest thing I have ever seen,” she told him.
“I could say that about what you did for the guy sitting in front of your building earlier, but I won’t. Mine was sweeter.”
Her laugh reached the customers near the front door. “Sorry,” she said, covering her mouth, trying to muffle the sound. “You are a brat!”
“The boys’ names are Jon and Johnny. Isn’t that sweet? They’re hoping to open a clothing store in the village.” As he set his coffee cup on the saucer, his hand trembled again, rattling both. “Don’t ever apologize for your laugh. I like people that let their emotions out. I’d hate to think what would happen if you tried to hold that inside. It could be catastrophic! Your eyes and brain would be scattered everywhere!” he nearly shrilled, while his hand swiped through the air as if he were carrying a tray of filled coffee cups.
She was about to ask him about his hand, but he stood, excused himself, and headed toward the restroom. His hand, his life. It was quite simply none of her business.
When he returned, they continued to talk for another hour or so. Allen had participated in the Stonewall riots and Mel wanted to learn about every scrap of it.
“I witnessed the woman, Storme DeLarverie, fighting the cops. Some aren’t sure it was her, but I’m convinced it was. When she yelled out to us, ‘Why don’t you guys do something?’ we all went crazy. I guess we all have a boiling point.”
“Truer words, my friend. Ben wanted so much to be a part of it. He never hid who he was. All he ever wanted was to work for, well, someone exactly like you. Damn, you would have loved him,” she said, leaning back in her chair.
“The mob and the cops were involved in the whole thing. Talk about an uphill battle. At that time, the lesbians, queens and gays were not exactly a team.”
“Really? You’d think people treating all of you like dirt would be enough to pull everyone together,” she said.
“Well, to be fair, I’ve seen the same sort of division in the women’s movement.”
“You’re right.” She paused and said, “Things are going to change. They’ve got to. We have no control over who we fall in love with.” She lit one of the two cigarettes she had left. “Would you like one?” she offered. He waved it off. “Do you have somebody special in your life?” she asked.
“Yes, I do. A man named Christopher.” Allen’s eyes lit up.
“How did you meet?”
“Everyone thinks we met at a fashion show. We met while waiting for a cab. Long story short, we ended up sharing one and kept on sharing.”
“How long are the two of you together?”
“Almost a year,” he answered with a smile.
“How did you know it was love?”
“Oh, good Lord. How does anyone ever truly know? I wish I could say that it was love at first sight. Like a bolt of lightning jabbing me in the heart and I would never be the same. I think that’s bull. It never happens that way. How about you? Is there someone special?”
“No,” she said, stood and tossed her bag over her shoulder. She sighed as she thought about the bill. “I don’t even have enough money for a decent tip. I promise I will pay you back.” As she passed the kaleidoscope painting, she stopped to take a closer look but gasped when she saw the price.
He stood and tossed a few bills on the table. As he passed the waitress, he shoved a few additional bills into her pocket. “Thank you, dear.” She smiled at him, then continued to pour coffee into another young man’s cup, flirting away with her latest customer.
It felt good to have something substantial in her stomach for a change. As they left the eatery and headed north, a sophisticated man walked toward them. His Dobermann ignored the noises around him. “Geeze. Check out this beautiful beast,” she gushed. “Excuse me. May I pet him?” she asked the gentleman.
“He can be skittish,” he replied.
Mel held her hand out palm down. She let the dog take its time sniffing, and then she turned her hand over. He began to lick her fingers.
“Well, I’ll be,” said the man.
“My trick is to let them smell me when I just finished eating,” she joked. The gentleman chuckled as he and his pet went on with their walk.
“You like dogs?” Allen asked.
“To be honest, I love them. Dogs are such wonderful creatures. They love you no matter what. That’s hard to find.”
“Let me get a cab.” There were none in sight. While they waited at the curb, a policeman began to cross the street and headed toward them. Allen shoved his hand into his pockets and quietly asked, “Would you take my arm?”
Mel did not realize what was happening but did what he had asked. It was then that she noticed the officer. Mel laid her head on his shoulder and focused her gaze on a couple window shopping across the street. Once he had passed, she removed her arm from his. “I hate that fucking shit,” she hissed. Allen looked down at her face. Her eyes were blazing. He waved down an approaching cab, and they piled in.
“You can’t let it get to you,” he said in a matter-of fact kind of way. He turned his attention to the cabbie and said, “West Central Park and 69th.” This time, she accepted when he offered a cigarette.
Pulling her hair back, she leaned into the lighter’s flame. She sighed. “I’m not able to pay for anything, and it’s driving me nuts. I’m embarrassed,” and sighed again. “As soon as I…”
“Later, OK?” he asked and patted her hand.
She could not help but look up at all the high-reaching buildings that stood in Manhattan. “I can never get over just how immense this place is.” Her head was just about upside down, trying to get the best possible view.
“Yes. You are adorable.” She didn’t hear him. The city and all its energy had her full attention. Allen turned to the gorgeous driver. When they arrived at his address, the cabbie thanked Allen for the tip. He also handed him a slip of paper with his name and number on it.
Allen just smiled and put it in his pocket.
A uniformed doorman held open the heavy glass door. “Good afternoon, Mr. Shandi.”
“Hey there, George. How are Christina and the baby?”
“They are wonderful, thanks for asking.”
“Come on. You must have a picture, yes?”
With that, George pulled his wallet out of his pocket and opened it to a photo.
“Oh,” Allen said with a sigh. “Oh my gosh. They are lovely. Is Penelope about four months old now? Look at these beautiful women, Mel.”
She took the wallet. The woman in the photo looked thrilled to be a mom. Little Penelope’s toothless grin was precious. “You are a very lucky man,” she said placing her hand on her abdomen. Still smiling, she handed it back to him.
“Yes, I am.” George took a few seconds to look at the picture before putting it away.
“By the way, Christopher has taken Daphne for a walk.”
Allen gave him a wink. “Thanks, George.”
The elevator required a unique key to go to the penthouse. Mel and Allen rode it nine floors up. When the elevator doors opened, they stepped into a small area with a large door across the way. He opened it and they entered an extravagant vestibule. Mel had never seen or could even imagine such wealth. An older gentleman greeted Allen with his mail and messages.
He looked inquisitively at Melanie.
Allen said, “This is my sweet friend, Melanie. Mel, this is Quinten. If you need or want anything, this is your man.”
Mel extended her hand out to Quinten and said, “Nice to meet you.” He hesitated and looked at Allen. Allen grinned.
He took her hand and said, “It’s very nice to meet you. Would you prefer Mel or Melanie?”
“Either is fine. May I use the bathroom?”
“Of course, follow me, please.”
The bathroom was straight ahead and to the right. It was below a winding staircase with full bookshelves. Quinten lightly pressed the spine of a red and black book, and a door opened outward. Orange-yellow light spilled out onto the tiled floor.
“I’ve never actually seen a secret door. Very cool! Thank you,” she said and went inside. The dominant color was red, and the accent colors were black, gold and purple. Tiles of red with gold swirls outlined in black covered the bottom half of the walls. The upper half was crimson. She was sure the entire room was larger than her apartment. There were several black and red velvet ottomans and a purple and gold chaise lounge in a sitting area. On the other side of a half wall was the toilet and a bidet alongside it. Over the double sinks hung an enormous mirror with an ornate frame. She set her bag on the black marble counter between the sinks. As she sat on the toilet, she tried to take all of it in. “And this is just the bathroom,” she whispered. Once she’d finished, she washed her hands and raked her fingers through her hair.
Allen was waiting for her. “I’d like to show you something.” They went up the stairs and off to the left. After passing several rooms, Allen held open the door to a bedroom. She flashed him a confused expression.
“Oh! No. This isn’t one of those ‘I’d like to show you my etchings’ snares. I wanted to show you a few things from my collection. It’s through the doorway on the left.”
She did not budge. “Wait here,” he said and disappeared into that room. As he came back, he draped pieces of clothing on hangers across the bed. Spreading them out, he chose a backless sequin-covered halter top jumpsuit in champagne gold. “Isn’t this scrumptious?”
“It’s dazzling. But it’s not my style.”
He looked at the remainder of what was on the bed. “That’s the second time you’ve mentioned your style. What is your style, exactly?”
“I like a less feminine look, you know? I’ve always been a tomboy,” she said timidly. “Do you design things for men?”
The sound of quickly clicking toenails on the wood floor grew louder. With that, a magnificent Rottweiler burst into the room. “Daphne-love!” gushed Allen.
Catching his breath, Christopher followed. He stood over six feet tall, blonde hair parted on the right and trimmed with precision. Although he was slender, he was muscular the way 20-year-old men often are. “I’m back from our daily tug. She is going to pull my arm out one of these days,” he said.
Daphne’s interest shifted to the new scent in the room. Her full tail swished back and forth as she sniffed Mel’s feet and legs.
“Who is this?” Christopher asked, inspecting Mel.
She stuck out her hand, “I’m Mel Foster.” He hesitated for a moment, then took her hand. “It’s very nice to meet you,” she said. Still looking at Christopher, she asked, “Daphne’s tail is intact? I don’t think I’ve ever seen that. She’s a beauty.”
“We got her when she was a pup, and we specifically told them not to do that. It’s unthinkable,” Allen huffed.
Mel was on her knees, along with Christopher, cuddling and scratching her belly. “We had a large dog when I was little. Just a mutt, but at least 100 pounds. My father found a harness for her and it helped when we had to walk her.” Daphne jumped onto Mel knocking her back with her legs folded under her and began licking her face. Mel laughed and hugged her around the neck.
“Daphne!” Allen laughed. “Come! Come here, my girl.” She obediently went to his side.
“May I have a washcloth or something?” Mel asked once Allen had lured Daphne away.
Christopher answered, “Sure.” Mel followed him out of the bedroom and down the hall.
“Second door on the left,” he said with a forced smile.
She pushed the door, but it did not close all the way. Splashing her face with warm soap and water removed the drool from her face. Two black velvet ottomans placed side by side with a tiny table between were in the corner. She sat and took advantage of the small, crystal ashtray. Digging through her bag, she retrieved her last cigarette, matches and a hair clip. Taking a deep drag, she grabbed everything and went to the mirror. With the cigarette hanging from her mouth, she pulled her thick hair and piled it on the crown of her head. The extra-large leather slide barely fit over her mop of curls. She pushed the stick through the holes to secure everything in place. Invariably, five or six tendrils hung down around her neck, dripping down over her back and shoulders. She could hear a discussion growing louder coming from the bedroom. “She will end up becoming just another fag-hag for you. What is this, the fifth? I do not need yet another person hanging around watching us as if you and I were a freakshow,” Christopher said firmly.
“You are wrong about her. She’s one of us. Her ideas about women’s clothing are perfect for what’s down the road,” said Allen.
“Is that how you met her?” There was a pause.
Trying to make her presence known, Mel tugged the door open and stomped heavily onto the floor. Daphne flounced toward her. “I’m going to have to get going, little girl.” Holding either side of her enormous head, she kissed her loudly.
“Your hair. I love it!” declared Allen. “I have a proposal for you, Mel. You brought up a more masculine feel for women’s clothing. Would you help me bring that idea to life?” Allen asked.
“I don’t know the first thing about fashion.”
Christopher laughed, “You’ve got that right.”
“Now, now. Let’s not be bitchy,” said Allen.
Mel motioned toward Christopher while looking at Allen and said, “He understands that I do not…”
“Sometimes, all you need to know is what you like and what you don’t like,” said Allen. “Like art.” He grabbed her hand and led her to the back of the bedroom. After opening the double-door walk-in closet, he began to look through his clothes. He chose a white button-down shirt from his closet. “What would you do with this?” He held it out to her. His right arm was across his chest and was clutching his left bicep. His forearm extended outward with the palm of his hand facing the ceiling, and the shirt dangled from his fingertip. She would come to know this as his “What say you?” pose.
“Seriously?” She exhaled. Taking the shirt from him, she hung it from an indentation on one of the columns of the four-poster bed. Christopher gasped at the thought of damage done to the tiger maple column. “I would make it sleeveless and shorten the front to waist length.” She turned it around. Christopher stepped in and held it for her. “Thanks, Christopher. It could be darted a bit to fit my form, then lengthened the shirttail to fall just passed the…” she patted her rear.
“Ass?” Christopher asked. Allen gave him a look.
“Well, I was gonna say cheeks, but either fit. Split it up the middle to about two inches below the waistline. It would end up kind of like tails on a tux. If you could give it lapels rather than a collar, I think that would be something I’d like.”
“What would you wear with it?” asked Allen.
Taking a moment to think, she finally said, “I would wear straight leg jeans and man boots up to my knees. You know, the kind that you tie up in the front without the spiky heels.”
Allen looked over at Christopher and said, “Do you see what I mean?”
“Do you design clothes also, Christopher?”
He seemed insulted by the question. “I am a model,” he answered in a sharp tone.
“I’m sorry. I don’t read many magazines.” Pointing out her appearance with gesturing hands, she laughed, “Just look at me for crying out loud!”
“I have to give you that,” Christopher said.
“Honey, that’s not…” Allen started to say.
“But it’s funny and appropriate,” answered Mel. “Allen, thanks for all of this. I’ve got to get going.”
A nearly palpable look went from Allen to Christopher. Christopher shrugged his shoulders and said, “OK,” and he left the room.
“This might be forward, but I…we wondered if you would consider staying with us while we take Cleo in this new direction? This place has several empty rooms. But I think you’d truly love the one on the far end.”
“But I haven’t agreed to the clothing thing.”
He ignored her. She followed him to an enormous room down the hallway. Daphne’s toenails let them know she was right behind them. Everything was covered with sheets except the king-size bed. Sliding glass doors on the far side of the room led to a balcony complete with greenery and furniture. The walls were white, and the furniture was in varying shades of red. As the sun fell low in the sky, it cast a fantastic orangey-pink over everything around her, including Allen.
“Isn’t it gorgeous?”
“Yes, but I have a job,” she said.
He came toward her and held her by the shoulders. “This is an opportunity to grow. It will be your job. Name your price.” She was only aware of his hands on her. Everything else was a blur. “Please?” he asked, batting his eyes again. Allen bent down a bit to meet her eye and was inches from her face. “I need you.”
She paused, then finally said, “Yes. Thank you. Allen, I am so grateful…” but the lump in her throat and tears squelched her ability to speak.
Allen threw his arms around her and she pulled away just a bit. He laughed and said, “I’m sorry. I excite easily!”
“Good to know,” she said, patting him on the back. He laughed into her ear. The sensation of his breath on her neck was incredible and alarming at once. “I have one request.”
“Name it.”
She pulled back and placed her hands on his chest. “I am not a huggee, cuddly, touchy-feely person. Please, don’t take it the wrong way. You are such a great guy, a real gentleman. You would never deliberately hurt anyone. It just makes me uncomfortable.”
He looked into her eyes. “Of course, I can respect that.” He backed away. “I understand, you know. Maybe better than most. I was different, too.” She felt light-headed.
“Are you alright?” he asked.
“Yes. I think I need a shower and a good night’s sleep.”
“Can I have Quinten bring you a bite to eat?”
“No, not right now. If I get hungry, I’ll poke around the kitchen, if that’s OK.”
“It’s fine with me, but Quinten gets a bit touchy when his domain is disturbed.”
“I promise I’ll clean up after myself,” she offered.
“Good Lord, woman, I was joking! Feel free to have anything you’d like.” He left her room and closed the door behind him.
Chapter 3
By the next morning, all of Mel’s belongings had been picked up and delivered to the penthouse. That afternoon, Allen purchased a month’s worth of clothing for her right down to her panties, along with a carton of her favorite cigarettes plus several joints. She sat on the edge of the bed surrounded by all of it, including the jelly jar she’d given to Fred and her prized possession. It was an old lockbox. Taking the key out of her bag, she placed the box on her lap and opened it slowly. Lifting the three photographs of her brother, Benjamin, from inside, she traced his face with her finger. It also contained a spool of fishing line. She looked up to see Allen standing in the doorway. She closed the box and set it aside.
“Would you like a hand putting things away?” he asked.
“I can’t accept all of this.”
“Consider it an advance,” he said. “Anything you dislike will be returned, exchanged, whatever.” He walked toward her.
Mel stood and moved toward the middle of the room. “You could have let my friend keep the glass,” she remarked.
“I did something a little better, I think. I hope you agree. Fred now occupies your old apartment, and I’ve paid up for two years. He has several new outfits, a bit of cash, and will be filling in at your old job until you decide what you want to do. I will find another place for you to live if you think this isn’t working out, but I want you to share your ideas with me,” he said in a serious tone.
She turned away from him. “I’m going to do my very best for you. Thank you for giving me this chance.”
He moved toward her, then thought better of it. Quinten knocked on the door frame.
“Excuse me, Sir. How many for dinner tonight?”
“Six, I think. Very casual, OK?” Allen asked.
“Time?”
“Six-thirty.”
“Is there anything, in particular, you would like tonight, Sir?”
“Mel, if you sat down in a restaurant and could have anything you wanted, what would it be?” Allen asked her.
She chuckled. “I feel as if I’m in a dream, or I’m high. Maybe I’ve died and gone to Heaven.” She asked timidly, “Do you like spaghetti and meatballs and maybe a salad?”
“Perfect. Is that doable, Quinten?”
“Of course, Sir. Can I get you anything in the meantime, Miss Melanie?”
“No thanks, and for God’s sake, drop the Miss. You make me feel as if I’m the character in ‘Gone with the Wind’! Or worse, my mother.”
“Quinten, could you give us a minute?”
“Of course,” he said and went downstairs.
Allen sat on the bench at the foot of the bed. His legs crossed at the knee and leaning back on his hands. “Did I tell you how I ended up living here?” he asked Mel. She shook her head, no. He gestured with his hand for her to sit next to him. She sat beside him with her legs apart, her elbows resting on her thighs and hands folded. He brushed her hair over her shoulder.
“I just want to see your face, OK?”
“Yes,” she answered and looked at him.
“My father owned an oil conglomerate. It doesn’t matter which one. They are all greed-factories. He could buy and sell God, or so he said. The best part is that God got the last laugh. One morning he told his secretary that there were to be no phone calls, no interruptions. He had a massive heart attack at his desk while she typed away just outside his door. Side note, she was also his mistress. An hour and a half later, she poked her head in to ask a question. She found him sweat-soaked and face down in a pool of his vomit. The Man upstairs is a funny guy, don’t you agree?”
“I gather you were not close to him?”
“No one was. My father loved money and fucking women. If he could have figured out a way to bang them with a roll of hundreds on his cock, it would have been his ejaculation of a lifetime.”
“Wow,” she chuckled. “How did your mom take it?”
“Poor thing, she loved him and not for his money. She would tell me about the 19-year-old boy she’d met all those years ago. Generous, kind, hardworking and very gentle with her. Somewhere along the line, he soured. He began drinking to excess and worse, hitting her. He became ruthless.”
“Did he know you are gay?”
“I think if he’d spent just a bit of time with me, he would have. But you must be in the same room with a person, look into their eyes, listen to what they say to learn anything. My wonderful mother died two years after my father. Countless homes, cars, all kinds of ‘things’ had become the property of my brother and me. Did I tell you I have a brother? Keith. Funny guy. A good man. Anyway. He and I sold most of it and gave the money to charities for the homeless, hospitals, but the best was handing out money to anyone that looked like they could use it. We knew this would make the old bastard roll in his grave. Even better, we made the donations in his name.”
“Ooooh, you scoundrels. I love it,” she laughed.
“Quinten has been with our family since before I was born. He is an old-fashioned gentleman’s gentleman. He just can’t help himself. I know for certain there were times that he would intercept when that bastard was after my mom. He’d lie and say there was a phone call or news on TV about my father’s company. My father was so drunk he probably could have distracted him with a ring of keys, …like an infant. All that being said, Quinten is who he is, and we accept him that way. Alright?”
Her face was beet red. “Yes. Understood. I’ll make it right.” She looked back on the bed and asked, “I hate to sound like such a girl, but what are you wearing tonight?”
Allen laughed. “How do jeans and a shirt sound? Shoes are optional.”
“Comfortable, thank you.”
Allen’s chef, Wyatt Edmonds, had taken the time to ask Mel about her selection for dinner, right down to the amount of garlic or basil. He stood at six foot four and two hundred forty pounds of muscle. He looked extremely intimidating, but that turned out to be completely wrong. He was a gentle and soft-spoken man. It was moving to see his interest in what would make her happy.
That evening, softly playing jazz hung in the background. Allen and Christopher were in one of two black loveseats in a cozy area of the living room. The other loveseat was directly across from them, with two red high-back chairs between them facing the fireplace. A black lacquered coffee table sat between it all.
The first to arrive were two women that worked in the garment district. Eric had red cropped hair and was wearing a man’s blue button-down shirt tucked into her black jeans with a matching blue belt and sneakers.
Mel asked Eric, “May I ask, do you consider yourself a ‘he’ or ‘she’?”
“He, and thank you for asking.” His girlfriend, Meghan also had red hair, but shoulder length. She wore a short denim skirt, a red sweater and black high heels. After the introductions, Allen offered drinks. Eric would have his usual Pabst Blue Ribbon beer in a pint glass while Meghan preferred white wine. Rather than help, Christopher called out for a vodka and tonic. As Allen gave Eric and Meghan their drinks, he heard the elevator door open and excused himself. Mel went to the bar to make Christopher’s drink. She brought it to him and asked, “What do you think Allen will have?”
“I have no idea,” he answered, not meeting her eyes.
“Mel, meet Zora Preston. She is a buyer for one of the high-end stores on 5th Avenue. Zora, Mel Foster.”
She was a tall, curvy African American woman with a beautiful, giant Afro. She wore a tight-fitting, sleeveless black turtleneck sweater, large gold hoop earrings and a floor-length striped skirt in all the colors of the rainbow. Mel smiled and shook her hand. “Do you prefer Mel or Melanie?” Zora asked in a soft and sexy voice.
“Either is fine.”
“Then, Melanie, it is.”
“Your hair is gorgeous!” Mel gushed.
“As is yours,” she responded, taking a handful and twirling it between her fingers.
“I told her just how beautiful you are, Mel. And did I lie?” Allen asked, holding his hands to her like the statuesque women on game shows would when displaying a new car.
Mel became an entirely new shade of red. “Allen, please.” She laughed and turned to Zora. “If you know Allen at all, then you know how generous he is with his compliments. Zora, what can I get you to drink?”
“I’ll have whatever you’re having,” she smiled, putting her hand on top of Mel’s. The sound of ice cubes clinking together came from Christopher. He’d raised his glass and shook it. Allen snatched it from his hand, then he and Mel went to the bar.
“What’s going on, Allen?”
“I’m sorry for Christopher’s behavior.”
“That’s not what I meant. Why is Zora here?”
“I thought the two of you might hit it off,” he said innocently.
“Oh, good Christ,” she said, leaning on the marble surface. She closed her eyes and said, “Are you under the impression that I am a lesbian?”
“Well, yes.”
“Oh, my God,” she whispered, then laughed. “I can’t be upset with you. A tomboy is a stone’s throw from that. No, I’m not a lesbian. This beautiful woman was brought here as my date?”
“I am so sorry,” he said, thoroughly embarrassed. “Let me talk to Zora.”
“No. That’s OK. Let me,” Mel said. After handing Christopher his drink, she asked, “Zora, would you mind checking out the wine selections?”
“Not at all.”
Allen watched out of the corner of his eye as Mel placed her hand on Zora’s back. Mel smiled at her and spoke softly. A look of confusion came across Zora’s face as Mel spoke but quickly changed to a warm smile. Zora placed her hand on Mel’s. She kissed her on the forehead and, with her thumb, wiped the lipstick it left behind. Their attention turned to the wine. Mel laughed loudly at something Zora said. Christopher smirked at Mel. “Idiot,” he said under his breath. Allen shot him a look.
The evening continued as if nothing had happened. The dining room table was set, complete with two flower arrangements. Allen and Christopher sat at opposite ends of the table. Eric and Meghan sat on one side and Mel and Zora on the other.
Mel asked Eric, “How long have you two been together?”
Eric lifted Meghan’s hand from under the table and kissed it. “Two years. The first time I saw Meghan, I was hooked. I couldn’t take my eyes off her. Then she turned and looked at me and smiled. I couldn’t believe it. Everything came into focus. People say things like the sky is bluer, the birds sing more sweetly, and that is the truth. She was just what I needed in my life,” Eric said and leaned in for a kiss.

PART ONE — HER STYLE
Chapter 1—September 6th, 1972
The night breeze was a welcome sensation after spending six hours working up a sweat cleaning one of the NYU buildings off Washington Square. This seedy side of town always put Melanie on edge. The drenched bandana covering her hair would stay in place until she was safely back in her room. Reaching into her purple bag, she found her keys. Before putting one foot on the sidewalk, she made sure the keys were spread apart and protruding between her fingers.
The walk to the Village Plaza Hotel took as long as smoking one cigarette, three quarters if she was nervous. Three drags in, she heard a low, angry voice. A lighter voice responded as if confused. In the darkness of a doorway off to the left, Melanie could make out a large man hanging over a smaller person.
“Faggot, yer gonna get yer fuckin’ ass kicked,” he growled while raising his massive fist back over his shoulder. It was then that Mel realized the smaller person was a man trying to cover his head with his hands.
Quickly, she stepped toward them. “Honey, where have you been?” she asked, pulling the bandana off her head. The growler, still clenching his fist, turned to look at her. For just a few seconds, he stared at her. Her dirty bell-bottoms and loosely fitting t-shirt covering her slender body did not distract him from the long, curly-cue, strawberry blonde hair that framed her beautiful face and fell to her elbows. With one hand on her hip, she flicked the cigarette to the side. For a fleeting moment, the only sounds were a few crickets communicating with each other. She took that time to smile and step toward him. When she was close enough to see him begin to smile back, her right arm swung around, connecting with his left cheek and eye. The punch itself was not remarkable, but the keys split his face and it had begun to bleed. He lost his balance just enough to allow her to finish the job by kneeing him in the groin. He yelped in pain as he fell over, clutching his crotch. Placing her arm under the light voiced man’s arm, she brought him to his feet.
All he could do was stare at her. Not for her hair and sweet face, but because he was dumbstruck. He’d seen only one other woman fight like that.
Grabbing his hand, they ran down Washington Place. Twice, she looked back to see if the beast was behind them. Tugging him to the right, they ran into the hotel. The man behind the desk in the lobby yelled, “Where are you going?”
“It’s me, Melanie, Mr. Jones.” The three flights of stairs took the last of her energy. Looking back over her shoulder, she felt a little safer. She had not let go of his hand. At times, he’d run right beside her, others ahead of her. They stopped on the third floor. She let go of him and bent over, hands on her knees, trying to catch her breath. With a sweeping motion, she tossed her hair back and stood upright. In front of her darkened doorway, she finally looked over at him. Once her eyes adjusted to the light, she saw his face. In the shadows of a dimly lit bare bulb screwed into the ceiling, she could see his smile. He leaned against the wall with his hand shaking against his chest.
“You’ll be OK,” she tried to say in a calm voice.
His long, dark brown, shiny hair fell in layers just below his shoulders. A pair of Aviator prescription glasses rested on his significant and masculine nose. Eyeliner enhanced his almond-shaped brown eyes and long lashes. Her eyes fell to his mouth, and she couldn’t help but stare at his lips. They were the kind that made women jealous. Both the top and bottom were full. The deep dimples were like perpetual parentheses on the edges of that extraordinary mouth. Once he stood up straight, Melanie guessed he was only a few inches taller than her, putting him at about 5’11”. A bead of blood rolled down over his eyelid.
“Looks like he got a punch in.” She handed him a tissue from her bag, put her blood-covered door key in the worn lock and opened it. He followed her inside.
The kitchen was no more than an area in the otherwise Lilliputian room. She pulled the only chair from the tiny table and motioned for him to sit.
“What’s your name?” she asked as she rinsed off her keys.
“Allen. Shandi.”
She smiled. “Like the beer?”
“No,” he smiled, “as in boisterous.” He looked around the room. It was shabby but clean. Not like anything he’d ever experienced. “And what is your name? I heard you say, ‘Melanie.’”
“Yeah. Melanie. Mel. Foster.”
“As in cultivate?”
“Nah. Like the Grant’s.”
His laugh was light and feminine. Mel pulled a small container from under the twin bed and put it on the threadbare rug next to him. Inside was an assortment of necessities. It contained a sewing needle stuck in a spool of white thread, a hammer, a box of band-aids, a roll of tape, and a small glass container of hydrogen peroxide. She retrieved a band-aid and the bottle.
“Would you take off your glasses, please?”
“Truth be told, my vision is horrible. I can only see about a foot in front of me without them,” he told her.
“I’d like to clean out that cut. That bastard was filthy. It wouldn’t surprise me if you caught something just by breathing in the same space as that creep did. Your glasses could use a wipe, too.” He removed them and tilted his head towards her. “This might sting a bit,” Mel warned. She lifted his thick hair away from his forehead. The aroma of pot and sandalwood floated up to her and it made her smile. She lightly patted his head with a paper towel with the tiniest bit of hydrogen peroxide.
“Jesus!” He winced.
“I’m sorry,” she said, and blew on the cut.
“I haven’t thanked you for saving me from that Neanderthal. What would ever make you go after something that size?”
She paused. “The ‘f’ word.”
“Fuck?”
“Faggot.” The very word made her purse her lips. “May I have your glasses?” She took them, gave them a quick cleaning on her shirt, and held them out to him.
He reached for her hand holding the paper towel, but she quickly pulled away. He was startled by her reaction. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean anything by it,” he said. “I should go. Thank you for your care and time.” He put his glasses back on, then got up and walked to the door.
She was still holding the bloodied paper towel as he closed the door behind him. Her head fell back. “Oh, good Christ,” she said, disappointed in herself. “Let it go!” she whispered.
Once she’d quickly washed the dirty coffee cup from that morning and rinsed herself off in front of the sink, she fell onto the bed. The sounds of New York City outside her window had finally become familiar to her. That was not what kept her from relaxing. The image of his face kept returning to her. Allen was beautiful. He’s gay. She punched her pillow in hopes of making it more comfortable and closed her eyes. Tomorrow is Saturday. She began a mental list of things to do. Things like laundry and groceries and such needed to be done. But then, she heard his laugh in her head. Her eyes opened, and she sighed. There will not be much in the way of sleep tonight. “Happy birthday to me,” she whispered.
Chapter 2
It was nearly noon when she opened her eyes. A light knock on the door startled her. She jumped out of bed and put on her robe.
“Who’s there?”
“I have a delivery for Miss Grant,” a deep voice said.
“Miss Grant?” she whispered, and then it clicked. “Hold on.” Grabbing her bag off the floor, she searched inside until she found a quarter at the bottom. Pulling the door open just a crack, she could see an enormous assortment of purple and white flowers. She opened it wide enough to take them. Slowly, the bouquet lowered, and Allen’s eyes came into view. He playfully batted them at her.
She laughed. “What’s this?”
“It’s just a modest gift in appreciation of your bravery. Also…” He handed her a large, beautifully wrapped box. She took it from him.
“Come on in, please. You didn’t have to do this.”
He placed the flowers on the tiny table, then turned to her. After adjusting his glasses against his nose, Allen stood with his hands behind his back. His skin-tight, shiny black jeans flared out into a modest bell. The shoes looked like women’s leather square-toed chunky-heeled pumps, but he made them look great. The tan tank top was sheer enough that the hair on his chest and the outline of his nipples were evident. Around his neck he wore a slender black leather tie that was loosened and hung low on his chest. The knot itself was strange. A black silk scarf was wrapped several times around his left wrist and tied, leaving the ends hanging about six inches.
She sat on the bed, pulled off the wrapping, and lifted the lid. Inside was a proper first aid kit, a sewing kit complete with scissors, and a few smaller tools complete with two kinds of screwdrivers, a tape measure, pliers and an adjustable wrench.
“This is too much!”
He sat near her and took out an ‘L’ shaped piece of metal and examined it. “What is this?”
“It’s an Allen wrench,” she laughed. His smile disappeared, and he placed it back in the box. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to….” Tentatively, she patted his shoulder and rose from the bed. “Would you like a cup of coffee? All I have is instant.” She clutched her robe at the neck and started to open one of the two cabinets.
“I was hoping I could take you out for a bite. It’s a lovely day. We could walk a bit if you’d like.” Mel did not answer. “We could take a cab if you prefer.”
“I…I don’t have any clean clothes. Today is laundry day for me. Can I take a raincheck?” she finally asked, not meeting his eye as her face reddened.
“Well, this is all too perfect! How long will it take for you to put on whatever you would have worn to the laundromat? In 15 minutes, I’ll have a cab out front, alright?”
“I don’t…”
“Please?” He held out his hand. She looked down, smiled and swatted her fingertips with his.
“Alright, then. Meet me outside in fifteen minutes,” Allen said with a smile. Just before he closed the door, he looked back at her, flashed that incredible smile again, and gave a quick nod in a way that somehow relaxed any of her suspicious feelings.
She lifted a pair of hip huggers from the top of a pile of clothes in her closet and shook them out. Her only clean shirt was a lilac sleeveless turtleneck her brother made for her. She brushed her teeth with one hand and ran her fingers through her thick hair with the other. Laying out two pieces of bread on the counter, she assembled a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. She rinsed out the paper coffee cup she’d saved from the day before and filled it with milk. The lid still fit. There were far too many beautiful flowers in her bouquet not to share. She chose three cosmoses, cut the stems, and set them in a little water-filled jelly jar. Splashing water on her face, she looked at her reflection in the aged mirror on the wall. As ready as I’ll ever be. Taking a deep breath, Melanie slung her bag over her shoulder. She tried to walk calmly down the three flights of stairs.
Through the dirty front door window, she could see Allen leaning on a cab, chatting with the driver. Just then, a tall blonde man walked by them. Both heads swiveled, taking a long look at his ass. She had to chuckle.
“I’d check that out myself,” she whispered.
The day was quite a bit cooler than the day before. Allen took a cigarette from his pocket, along with a gold lighter. As he lit up, he saw Melanie walking toward him. She turned to the homeless man sitting up against the building. “Fred, here’s a little something to eat. Would you save me the glass?” He reached out for the paper bag and cup. With his free hand, he took hers and kissed it. Mumbling something unintelligible to her, she smiled and gave him the flowers.
He placed them up against his leg, cupped his hand around the glass and admired his gift.
A breeze drifted down the street. Melanie’s nipples shriveled from the cold air. Her knee-jerk reaction was to draw her arms up to her chest. Allen noticed and immediately felt embarrassed for her.
A policeman walked by them and stopped to observe Allen. He grabbed Mel’s hand, opened the door to the cab, and helped her in. Walking to the other side, Allen kept an eye on him. He tipped an imaginary cap to the officer and climbed inside. “Broome and Mercer,” he directed and turned to her. “You are adorable!” he said, smiling at Mel. The cabbie stared at him through the rearview mirror.
“Where were you coming from last night?” he asked her.
“My job. I didn’t ask you how your head is.”
He smiled. “It’s fine. Where do you work?”
“In the evenings, I clean some of the buildings at NYU.” She lifted his hair away from the cut. Clicking her tongue at the sight of the half dollar sized bruise developing, she asked, “Did you ice this?”
“No. How old are you?”
“20. And you?”
“24. Where are you from originally?”
“Upstate New York. A tiny town no one’s ever heard of.”
“Is that where you learned to fight?” he asked with a smile.
The color seemed to drain from her face. A silence hung between them until the cab hit a pothole that sent them both leaning hard to the right. She caught Allen as he fell against her.
Her loud, nervous laugh made its debut, and it certainly could draw attention.
“Oh my! Well, I love that sound!” he said.
The cab pulled over and made a hard stop. “Broome and Mercer, Mr. Shandi.” Allen’s tight pants forced him to lean to the left awkwardly. Jamming his right hand in his front pocket, he retrieved a bundle of bills. Mel glanced down at his hands. The bulge to the left of the bottom of his zipper caught her off guard. She very quickly looked away. He gave the cabbie a $5 tip.
“Thank you, Mr. Shandi!” His hand began to tremble as he put his money away. She took notice, and he caught that. He exited, went to her side of the cab and opened the door. Offering her his left hand, he helped her climb out.
“Are you hungry? I’m hungry. Let’s get lunch. My treat,” he said, looking across the street. He grabbed her hand and they sprinted through the traffic. Horns began honking, and a few cars stopped short. He held his hand up in a thanks gesture. She loved the way his hair bounced as he trotted. They entered a narrow eatery. A decidedly gay man welcomed Allen.
“Mr. Shandi, it’s so good to see you again. Your table is ready.” Other couples that had been waiting were not regulars or did not carry the same weight as Allen. She did not know what to make of this.
They were seated across from one another in a dark and quiet corner. Paper menus were brought to the table by a pretty young lady. “What can I get you to drink, Mr. Shandi?” she asked in a coquettish manner. She reached past Melanie’s face to light the candle and replaced the dirty ashtray with a clean one.
“What would you like, Mel?”
No one had called her that in at least five years.
“Coffee please, with milk?” she asked, looking at the waitress.
“I’ll have the same.”
The waitress placed her hand on his shoulder and said, “You’ve got it, Honey.” She walked away with quite a sway in her hips. Mel grinned and looked over to see Allen reaching for her over the table. He took a lock of her curly hair and rolled it between his fingers.
“If mermaids were real, this is the kind of hair they would have.”
She laughed as her face turned red. “Wow. I’ve never heard that before.” The art that was curiously placed up against the wall caught her eye. One piece in particular stood out. “Take a peek at that one! It’s a kaleidoscope!” She turned her attention back to his face. He’d been staring at her. Feeling embarrassed, she pretended to go over the menu. “Where are you from?” Mel asked.
“I’m not an interesting person,” he said while lighting a cigarette. “Would you like one?” he offered.
“No, thanks. I don’t want to hear your deepest, darkest secrets. How about, what do you do for a living? I feel like I’m the only one not in on it. Everybody knows you. I’ve lived here for five months, and I have no idea what you do or why you are so,” she paused, “beloved.”
“Beloved. That’s interesting.” He propped up his elbow on the table, and he rested his chin in his hand. The smoke from his cigarette curled up around his face. She sat back in the chair and crossed her ankle over her knee. Lacing her fingers together, she rested her hands in her lap. Giving him an “I’ve got all day” look, she took a deep breath.
Tapping his cigarette on the ashtray, he asked, “Have you ever heard of a clothing line called ‘Cleo’?”
“Yes. Do you work for her?”
“Well, I am her, so to speak. I named it after a knot I created for a necktie.” He pointed to the one that hung from his neck. It almost appeared to be a braid, and yet it was not. “The business has been open for three and a half years. It was perfect timing for my vision of what young women wanted. And the rest as they say…” he laughed, waving his cigarette in the air.
The waitress returned with the coffee. “Have you decided what you’d like to eat?” she asked, staring directly at Allen.
“Not really. Can we have a few more minutes?”
“Sure, Honey,” she answered and sashayed away, stopping once to look over her shoulder at Allen. But his thoughts were elsewhere.
“Have you always known you were…a visionary?” Mel asked as she stirred her coffee.
Allen glanced around to see if anyone was within earshot. He whispered, “What exactly are you asking?”
“My brother made this top for me. Not really my style, but he made it with love.” She gently touched the gauzy fabric around her neck. “Ben knew he was gay from the time he was a little boy,” Mel said softly. Her eyes welled up. “My mother simply ignored that fact. My father had an altogether different take on Ben. The things he would punish him for, well, it would just break your heart. That bastard took off in 1965. Good riddance.”
“Where is Ben now?”
“Buried in the Oswegatchie Cemetery outside of Fine, NY. Fine, NY! Funny, huh?” she laughed to cover the sadness.
More customers had begun to fill the place. The waitress returned once more. “What will it be?” she asked.
“Mel?” he asked.
She kept her head down and asked, “May I have a burger?” A tear rolled down her nose and fell on the menu.
“I’ll have the same,” he said. The waitress jotted it down as she walked away.
He gave Mel his napkin. “Dry your eyes, Sweetness,” then moved to a chair next to her and put his arm around her shoulders. “There are souls that are just too beautiful for this world,” he whispered in her ear. She had thought the very same thing a thousand times.
Two gay teens cautiously approached the table. Mel looked up. “Your fans, Mr. S! If you’ll excuse me…” The young men nearly levitated over a chance to chat with Allen. He watched her walk through a narrow doorway and into the restroom.
Splashing a little water on her face, she looked at her reflection. Her hands gripped the sides of the sink. “Pull it together,” she whispered to herself. Once she’d collected herself with a few deep breaths, she headed back to the table. She stopped and watched Allen as he spoke to them. He listened carefully as they replied and talked about their dreams.
Allen was leaning forward, elbows on his knees and speaking softly. He was incredibly patient as he explained what it took to get where he was. His enormous smile was evidence that he seemed to enjoy this part of his celebrity.
She leaned against the door frame, legs crossed at the ankles, her arms crossed just below her chest.
The two teens stood close to each other. For a second, their pinkies hooked together. Allen grinned. Removing the scarf from his wrist, he tied it around the wrist of the young man on the left, then lifted the tie from his neck and put it on the other fan. He held out his hand to shake theirs.
An older couple seated at a nearby table shook their heads in disapproval. Mel stood and stared at them for a moment, then turned her back and obstructed their view. The boys practically pogoed over to her.
“Johnny, isn’t he amazing?” the shorter of the two asked his boyfriend.
He grinned at Mel and said, “He’s amazing!”
“He certainly is,” she replied. The boys left overwhelmed with joy about what had just happened.
The burgers arrived at the table as Mel sat back down. “Thank you,” she said to the waitress and tried to make eye contact.
Finally, she looked at Mel and said, “You’re welcome.”
“Those kids will be living on that for a long time. That’s just about the sweetest thing I have ever seen,” she told him.
“I could say that about what you did for the guy sitting in front of your building earlier, but I won’t. Mine was sweeter.”
Her laugh reached the customers near the front door. “Sorry,” she said, covering her mouth, trying to muffle the sound. “You are a brat!”
“The boys’ names are Jon and Johnny. Isn’t that sweet? They’re hoping to open a clothing store in the village.” As he set his coffee cup on the saucer, his hand trembled again, rattling both. “Don’t ever apologize for your laugh. I like people that let their emotions out. I’d hate to think what would happen if you tried to hold that inside. It could be catastrophic! Your eyes and brain would be scattered everywhere!” he nearly shrilled, while his hand swiped through the air as if he were carrying a tray of filled coffee cups.
She was about to ask him about his hand, but he stood, excused himself, and headed toward the restroom. His hand, his life. It was quite simply none of her business.
When he returned, they continued to talk for another hour or so. Allen had participated in the Stonewall riots and Mel wanted to learn about every scrap of it.
“I witnessed the woman, Storme DeLarverie, fighting the cops. Some aren’t sure it was her, but I’m convinced it was. When she yelled out to us, ‘Why don’t you guys do something?’ we all went crazy. I guess we all have a boiling point.”
“Truer words, my friend. Ben wanted so much to be a part of it. He never hid who he was. All he ever wanted was to work for, well, someone exactly like you. Damn, you would have loved him,” she said, leaning back in her chair.
“The mob and the cops were involved in the whole thing. Talk about an uphill battle. At that time, the lesbians, queens and gays were not exactly a team.”
“Really? You’d think people treating all of you like dirt would be enough to pull everyone together,” she said.
“Well, to be fair, I’ve seen the same sort of division in the women’s movement.”
“You’re right.” She paused and said, “Things are going to change. They’ve got to. We have no control over who we fall in love with.” She lit one of the two cigarettes she had left. “Would you like one?” she offered. He waved it off. “Do you have somebody special in your life?” she asked.
“Yes, I do. A man named Christopher.” Allen’s eyes lit up.
“How did you meet?”
“Everyone thinks we met at a fashion show. We met while waiting for a cab. Long story short, we ended up sharing one and kept on sharing.”
“How long are the two of you together?”
“Almost a year,” he answered with a smile.
“How did you know it was love?”
“Oh, good Lord. How does anyone ever truly know? I wish I could say that it was love at first sight. Like a bolt of lightning jabbing me in the heart and I would never be the same. I think that’s bull. It never happens that way. How about you? Is there someone special?”
“No,” she said, stood and tossed her bag over her shoulder. She sighed as she thought about the bill. “I don’t even have enough money for a decent tip. I promise I will pay you back.” As she passed the kaleidoscope painting, she stopped to take a closer look but gasped when she saw the price.
He stood and tossed a few bills on the table. As he passed the waitress, he shoved a few additional bills into her pocket. “Thank you, dear.” She smiled at him, then continued to pour coffee into another young man’s cup, flirting away with her latest customer.
It felt good to have something substantial in her stomach for a change. As they left the eatery and headed north, a sophisticated man walked toward them. His Dobermann ignored the noises around him. “Geeze. Check out this beautiful beast,” she gushed. “Excuse me. May I pet him?” she asked the gentleman.
“He can be skittish,” he replied.
Mel held her hand out palm down. She let the dog take its time sniffing, and then she turned her hand over. He began to lick her fingers.
“Well, I’ll be,” said the man.
“My trick is to let them smell me when I just finished eating,” she joked. The gentleman chuckled as he and his pet went on with their walk.
“You like dogs?” Allen asked.
“To be honest, I love them. Dogs are such wonderful creatures. They love you no matter what. That’s hard to find.”
“Let me get a cab.” There were none in sight. While they waited at the curb, a policeman began to cross the street and headed toward them. Allen shoved his hand into his pockets and quietly asked, “Would you take my arm?”
Mel did not realize what was happening but did what he had asked. It was then that she noticed the officer. Mel laid her head on his shoulder and focused her gaze on a couple window shopping across the street. Once he had passed, she removed her arm from his. “I hate that fucking shit,” she hissed. Allen looked down at her face. Her eyes were blazing. He waved down an approaching cab, and they piled in.
“You can’t let it get to you,” he said in a matter-of fact kind of way. He turned his attention to the cabbie and said, “West Central Park and 69th.” This time, she accepted when he offered a cigarette.
Pulling her hair back, she leaned into the lighter’s flame. She sighed. “I’m not able to pay for anything, and it’s driving me nuts. I’m embarrassed,” and sighed again. “As soon as I…”
“Later, OK?” he asked and patted her hand.
She could not help but look up at all the high-reaching buildings that stood in Manhattan. “I can never get over just how immense this place is.” Her head was just about upside down, trying to get the best possible view.
“Yes. You are adorable.” She didn’t hear him. The city and all its energy had her full attention. Allen turned to the gorgeous driver. When they arrived at his address, the cabbie thanked Allen for the tip. He also handed him a slip of paper with his name and number on it.
Allen just smiled and put it in his pocket.
A uniformed doorman held open the heavy glass door. “Good afternoon, Mr. Shandi.”
“Hey there, George. How are Christina and the baby?”
“They are wonderful, thanks for asking.”
“Come on. You must have a picture, yes?”
With that, George pulled his wallet out of his pocket and opened it to a photo.
“Oh,” Allen said with a sigh. “Oh my gosh. They are lovely. Is Penelope about four months old now? Look at these beautiful women, Mel.”
She took the wallet. The woman in the photo looked thrilled to be a mom. Little Penelope’s toothless grin was precious. “You are a very lucky man,” she said placing her hand on her abdomen. Still smiling, she handed it back to him.
“Yes, I am.” George took a few seconds to look at the picture before putting it away.
“By the way, Christopher has taken Daphne for a walk.”
Allen gave him a wink. “Thanks, George.”
The elevator required a unique key to go to the penthouse. Mel and Allen rode it nine floors up. When the elevator doors opened, they stepped into a small area with a large door across the way. He opened it and they entered an extravagant vestibule. Mel had never seen or could even imagine such wealth. An older gentleman greeted Allen with his mail and messages.
He looked inquisitively at Melanie.
Allen said, “This is my sweet friend, Melanie. Mel, this is Quinten. If you need or want anything, this is your man.”
Mel extended her hand out to Quinten and said, “Nice to meet you.” He hesitated and looked at Allen. Allen grinned.
He took her hand and said, “It’s very nice to meet you. Would you prefer Mel or Melanie?”
“Either is fine. May I use the bathroom?”
“Of course, follow me, please.”
The bathroom was straight ahead and to the right. It was below a winding staircase with full bookshelves. Quinten lightly pressed the spine of a red and black book, and a door opened outward. Orange-yellow light spilled out onto the tiled floor.
“I’ve never actually seen a secret door. Very cool! Thank you,” she said and went inside. The dominant color was red, and the accent colors were black, gold and purple. Tiles of red with gold swirls outlined in black covered the bottom half of the walls. The upper half was crimson. She was sure the entire room was larger than her apartment. There were several black and red velvet ottomans and a purple and gold chaise lounge in a sitting area. On the other side of a half wall was the toilet and a bidet alongside it. Over the double sinks hung an enormous mirror with an ornate frame. She set her bag on the black marble counter between the sinks. As she sat on the toilet, she tried to take all of it in. “And this is just the bathroom,” she whispered. Once she’d finished, she washed her hands and raked her fingers through her hair.
Allen was waiting for her. “I’d like to show you something.” They went up the stairs and off to the left. After passing several rooms, Allen held open the door to a bedroom. She flashed him a confused expression.
“Oh! No. This isn’t one of those ‘I’d like to show you my etchings’ snares. I wanted to show you a few things from my collection. It’s through the doorway on the left.”
She did not budge. “Wait here,” he said and disappeared into that room. As he came back, he draped pieces of clothing on hangers across the bed. Spreading them out, he chose a backless sequin-covered halter top jumpsuit in champagne gold. “Isn’t this scrumptious?”
“It’s dazzling. But it’s not my style.”
He looked at the remainder of what was on the bed. “That’s the second time you’ve mentioned your style. What is your style, exactly?”
“I like a less feminine look, you know? I’ve always been a tomboy,” she said timidly. “Do you design things for men?”
The sound of quickly clicking toenails on the wood floor grew louder. With that, a magnificent Rottweiler burst into the room. “Daphne-love!” gushed Allen.
Catching his breath, Christopher followed. He stood over six feet tall, blonde hair parted on the right and trimmed with precision. Although he was slender, he was muscular the way 20-year-old men often are. “I’m back from our daily tug. She is going to pull my arm out one of these days,” he said.
Daphne’s interest shifted to the new scent in the room. Her full tail swished back and forth as she sniffed Mel’s feet and legs.
“Who is this?” Christopher asked, inspecting Mel.
She stuck out her hand, “I’m Mel Foster.” He hesitated for a moment, then took her hand. “It’s very nice to meet you,” she said. Still looking at Christopher, she asked, “Daphne’s tail is intact? I don’t think I’ve ever seen that. She’s a beauty.”
“We got her when she was a pup, and we specifically told them not to do that. It’s unthinkable,” Allen huffed.
Mel was on her knees, along with Christopher, cuddling and scratching her belly. “We had a large dog when I was little. Just a mutt, but at least 100 pounds. My father found a harness for her and it helped when we had to walk her.” Daphne jumped onto Mel knocking her back with her legs folded under her and began licking her face. Mel laughed and hugged her around the neck.
“Daphne!” Allen laughed. “Come! Come here, my girl.” She obediently went to his side.
“May I have a washcloth or something?” Mel asked once Allen had lured Daphne away.
Christopher answered, “Sure.” Mel followed him out of the bedroom and down the hall.
“Second door on the left,” he said with a forced smile.
She pushed the door, but it did not close all the way. Splashing her face with warm soap and water removed the drool from her face. Two black velvet ottomans placed side by side with a tiny table between were in the corner. She sat and took advantage of the small, crystal ashtray. Digging through her bag, she retrieved her last cigarette, matches and a hair clip. Taking a deep drag, she grabbed everything and went to the mirror. With the cigarette hanging from her mouth, she pulled her thick hair and piled it on the crown of her head. The extra-large leather slide barely fit over her mop of curls. She pushed the stick through the holes to secure everything in place. Invariably, five or six tendrils hung down around her neck, dripping down over her back and shoulders. She could hear a discussion growing louder coming from the bedroom. “She will end up becoming just another fag-hag for you. What is this, the fifth? I do not need yet another person hanging around watching us as if you and I were a freakshow,” Christopher said firmly.
“You are wrong about her. She’s one of us. Her ideas about women’s clothing are perfect for what’s down the road,” said Allen.
“Is that how you met her?” There was a pause.
Trying to make her presence known, Mel tugged the door open and stomped heavily onto the floor. Daphne flounced toward her. “I’m going to have to get going, little girl.” Holding either side of her enormous head, she kissed her loudly.
“Your hair. I love it!” declared Allen. “I have a proposal for you, Mel. You brought up a more masculine feel for women’s clothing. Would you help me bring that idea to life?” Allen asked.
“I don’t know the first thing about fashion.”
Christopher laughed, “You’ve got that right.”
“Now, now. Let’s not be bitchy,” said Allen.
Mel motioned toward Christopher while looking at Allen and said, “He understands that I do not…”
“Sometimes, all you need to know is what you like and what you don’t like,” said Allen. “Like art.” He grabbed her hand and led her to the back of the bedroom. After opening the double-door walk-in closet, he began to look through his clothes. He chose a white button-down shirt from his closet. “What would you do with this?” He held it out to her. His right arm was across his chest and was clutching his left bicep. His forearm extended outward with the palm of his hand facing the ceiling, and the shirt dangled from his fingertip. She would come to know this as his “What say you?” pose.
“Seriously?” She exhaled. Taking the shirt from him, she hung it from an indentation on one of the columns of the four-poster bed. Christopher gasped at the thought of damage done to the tiger maple column. “I would make it sleeveless and shorten the front to waist length.” She turned it around. Christopher stepped in and held it for her. “Thanks, Christopher. It could be darted a bit to fit my form, then lengthened the shirttail to fall just passed the…” she patted her rear.
“Ass?” Christopher asked. Allen gave him a look.
“Well, I was gonna say cheeks, but either fit. Split it up the middle to about two inches below the waistline. It would end up kind of like tails on a tux. If you could give it lapels rather than a collar, I think that would be something I’d like.”
“What would you wear with it?” asked Allen.
Taking a moment to think, she finally said, “I would wear straight leg jeans and man boots up to my knees. You know, the kind that you tie up in the front without the spiky heels.”
Allen looked over at Christopher and said, “Do you see what I mean?”
“Do you design clothes also, Christopher?”
He seemed insulted by the question. “I am a model,” he answered in a sharp tone.
“I’m sorry. I don’t read many magazines.” Pointing out her appearance with gesturing hands, she laughed, “Just look at me for crying out loud!”
“I have to give you that,” Christopher said.
“Honey, that’s not…” Allen started to say.
“But it’s funny and appropriate,” answered Mel. “Allen, thanks for all of this. I’ve got to get going.”
A nearly palpable look went from Allen to Christopher. Christopher shrugged his shoulders and said, “OK,” and he left the room.
“This might be forward, but I…we wondered if you would consider staying with us while we take Cleo in this new direction? This place has several empty rooms. But I think you’d truly love the one on the far end.”
“But I haven’t agreed to the clothing thing.”
He ignored her. She followed him to an enormous room down the hallway. Daphne’s toenails let them know she was right behind them. Everything was covered with sheets except the king-size bed. Sliding glass doors on the far side of the room led to a balcony complete with greenery and furniture. The walls were white, and the furniture was in varying shades of red. As the sun fell low in the sky, it cast a fantastic orangey-pink over everything around her, including Allen.
“Isn’t it gorgeous?”
“Yes, but I have a job,” she said.
He came toward her and held her by the shoulders. “This is an opportunity to grow. It will be your job. Name your price.” She was only aware of his hands on her. Everything else was a blur. “Please?” he asked, batting his eyes again. Allen bent down a bit to meet her eye and was inches from her face. “I need you.”
She paused, then finally said, “Yes. Thank you. Allen, I am so grateful…” but the lump in her throat and tears squelched her ability to speak.
Allen threw his arms around her and she pulled away just a bit. He laughed and said, “I’m sorry. I excite easily!”
“Good to know,” she said, patting him on the back. He laughed into her ear. The sensation of his breath on her neck was incredible and alarming at once. “I have one request.”
“Name it.”
She pulled back and placed her hands on his chest. “I am not a huggee, cuddly, touchy-feely person. Please, don’t take it the wrong way. You are such a great guy, a real gentleman. You would never deliberately hurt anyone. It just makes me uncomfortable.”
He looked into her eyes. “Of course, I can respect that.” He backed away. “I understand, you know. Maybe better than most. I was different, too.” She felt light-headed.
“Are you alright?” he asked.
“Yes. I think I need a shower and a good night’s sleep.”
“Can I have Quinten bring you a bite to eat?”
“No, not right now. If I get hungry, I’ll poke around the kitchen, if that’s OK.”
“It’s fine with me, but Quinten gets a bit touchy when his domain is disturbed.”
“I promise I’ll clean up after myself,” she offered.
“Good Lord, woman, I was joking! Feel free to have anything you’d like.” He left her room and closed the door behind him.
Chapter 3
By the next morning, all of Mel’s belongings had been picked up and delivered to the penthouse. That afternoon, Allen purchased a month’s worth of clothing for her right down to her panties, along with a carton of her favorite cigarettes plus several joints. She sat on the edge of the bed surrounded by all of it, including the jelly jar she’d given to Fred and her prized possession. It was an old lockbox. Taking the key out of her bag, she placed the box on her lap and opened it slowly. Lifting the three photographs of her brother, Benjamin, from inside, she traced his face with her finger. It also contained a spool of fishing line. She looked up to see Allen standing in the doorway. She closed the box and set it aside.
“Would you like a hand putting things away?” he asked.
“I can’t accept all of this.”
“Consider it an advance,” he said. “Anything you dislike will be returned, exchanged, whatever.” He walked toward her.
Mel stood and moved toward the middle of the room. “You could have let my friend keep the glass,” she remarked.
“I did something a little better, I think. I hope you agree. Fred now occupies your old apartment, and I’ve paid up for two years. He has several new outfits, a bit of cash, and will be filling in at your old job until you decide what you want to do. I will find another place for you to live if you think this isn’t working out, but I want you to share your ideas with me,” he said in a serious tone.
She turned away from him. “I’m going to do my very best for you. Thank you for giving me this chance.”
He moved toward her, then thought better of it. Quinten knocked on the door frame.
“Excuse me, Sir. How many for dinner tonight?”
“Six, I think. Very casual, OK?” Allen asked.
“Time?”
“Six-thirty.”
“Is there anything, in particular, you would like tonight, Sir?”
“Mel, if you sat down in a restaurant and could have anything you wanted, what would it be?” Allen asked her.
She chuckled. “I feel as if I’m in a dream, or I’m high. Maybe I’ve died and gone to Heaven.” She asked timidly, “Do you like spaghetti and meatballs and maybe a salad?”
“Perfect. Is that doable, Quinten?”
“Of course, Sir. Can I get you anything in the meantime, Miss Melanie?”
“No thanks, and for God’s sake, drop the Miss. You make me feel as if I’m the character in ‘Gone with the Wind’! Or worse, my mother.”
“Quinten, could you give us a minute?”
“Of course,” he said and went downstairs.
Allen sat on the bench at the foot of the bed. His legs crossed at the knee and leaning back on his hands. “Did I tell you how I ended up living here?” he asked Mel. She shook her head, no. He gestured with his hand for her to sit next to him. She sat beside him with her legs apart, her elbows resting on her thighs and hands folded. He brushed her hair over her shoulder.
“I just want to see your face, OK?”
“Yes,” she answered and looked at him.
“My father owned an oil conglomerate. It doesn’t matter which one. They are all greed-factories. He could buy and sell God, or so he said. The best part is that God got the last laugh. One morning he told his secretary that there were to be no phone calls, no interruptions. He had a massive heart attack at his desk while she typed away just outside his door. Side note, she was also his mistress. An hour and a half later, she poked her head in to ask a question. She found him sweat-soaked and face down in a pool of his vomit. The Man upstairs is a funny guy, don’t you agree?”
“I gather you were not close to him?”
“No one was. My father loved money and fucking women. If he could have figured out a way to bang them with a roll of hundreds on his cock, it would have been his ejaculation of a lifetime.”
“Wow,” she chuckled. “How did your mom take it?”
“Poor thing, she loved him and not for his money. She would tell me about the 19-year-old boy she’d met all those years ago. Generous, kind, hardworking and very gentle with her. Somewhere along the line, he soured. He began drinking to excess and worse, hitting her. He became ruthless.”
“Did he know you are gay?”
“I think if he’d spent just a bit of time with me, he would have. But you must be in the same room with a person, look into their eyes, listen to what they say to learn anything. My wonderful mother died two years after my father. Countless homes, cars, all kinds of ‘things’ had become the property of my brother and me. Did I tell you I have a brother? Keith. Funny guy. A good man. Anyway. He and I sold most of it and gave the money to charities for the homeless, hospitals, but the best was handing out money to anyone that looked like they could use it. We knew this would make the old bastard roll in his grave. Even better, we made the donations in his name.”
“Ooooh, you scoundrels. I love it,” she laughed.
“Quinten has been with our family since before I was born. He is an old-fashioned gentleman’s gentleman. He just can’t help himself. I know for certain there were times that he would intercept when that bastard was after my mom. He’d lie and say there was a phone call or news on TV about my father’s company. My father was so drunk he probably could have distracted him with a ring of keys, …like an infant. All that being said, Quinten is who he is, and we accept him that way. Alright?”
Her face was beet red. “Yes. Understood. I’ll make it right.” She looked back on the bed and asked, “I hate to sound like such a girl, but what are you wearing tonight?”
Allen laughed. “How do jeans and a shirt sound? Shoes are optional.”
“Comfortable, thank you.”
Allen’s chef, Wyatt Edmonds, had taken the time to ask Mel about her selection for dinner, right down to the amount of garlic or basil. He stood at six foot four and two hundred forty pounds of muscle. He looked extremely intimidating, but that turned out to be completely wrong. He was a gentle and soft-spoken man. It was moving to see his interest in what would make her happy.
That evening, softly playing jazz hung in the background. Allen and Christopher were in one of two black loveseats in a cozy area of the living room. The other loveseat was directly across from them, with two red high-back chairs between them facing the fireplace. A black lacquered coffee table sat between it all.
The first to arrive were two women that worked in the garment district. Eric had red cropped hair and was wearing a man’s blue button-down shirt tucked into her black jeans with a matching blue belt and sneakers.
Mel asked Eric, “May I ask, do you consider yourself a ‘he’ or ‘she’?”
“He, and thank you for asking.” His girlfriend, Meghan also had red hair, but shoulder length. She wore a short denim skirt, a red sweater and black high heels. After the introductions, Allen offered drinks. Eric would have his usual Pabst Blue Ribbon beer in a pint glass while Meghan preferred white wine. Rather than help, Christopher called out for a vodka and tonic. As Allen gave Eric and Meghan their drinks, he heard the elevator door open and excused himself. Mel went to the bar to make Christopher’s drink. She brought it to him and asked, “What do you think Allen will have?”
“I have no idea,” he answered, not meeting her eyes.
“Mel, meet Zora Preston. She is a buyer for one of the high-end stores on 5th Avenue. Zora, Mel Foster.”
She was a tall, curvy African American woman with a beautiful, giant Afro. She wore a tight-fitting, sleeveless black turtleneck sweater, large gold hoop earrings and a floor-length striped skirt in all the colors of the rainbow. Mel smiled and shook her hand. “Do you prefer Mel or Melanie?” Zora asked in a soft and sexy voice.
“Either is fine.”
“Then, Melanie, it is.”
“Your hair is gorgeous!” Mel gushed.
“As is yours,” she responded, taking a handful and twirling it between her fingers.
“I told her just how beautiful you are, Mel. And did I lie?” Allen asked, holding his hands to her like the statuesque women on game shows would when displaying a new car.
Mel became an entirely new shade of red. “Allen, please.” She laughed and turned to Zora. “If you know Allen at all, then you know how generous he is with his compliments. Zora, what can I get you to drink?”
“I’ll have whatever you’re having,” she smiled, putting her hand on top of Mel’s. The sound of ice cubes clinking together came from Christopher. He’d raised his glass and shook it. Allen snatched it from his hand, then he and Mel went to the bar.
“What’s going on, Allen?”
“I’m sorry for Christopher’s behavior.”
“That’s not what I meant. Why is Zora here?”
“I thought the two of you might hit it off,” he said innocently.
“Oh, good Christ,” she said, leaning on the marble surface. She closed her eyes and said, “Are you under the impression that I am a lesbian?”
“Well, yes.”
“Oh, my God,” she whispered, then laughed. “I can’t be upset with you. A tomboy is a stone’s throw from that. No, I’m not a lesbian. This beautiful woman was brought here as my date?”
“I am so sorry,” he said, thoroughly embarrassed. “Let me talk to Zora.”
“No. That’s OK. Let me,” Mel said. After handing Christopher his drink, she asked, “Zora, would you mind checking out the wine selections?”
“Not at all.”
Allen watched out of the corner of his eye as Mel placed her hand on Zora’s back. Mel smiled at her and spoke softly. A look of confusion came across Zora’s face as Mel spoke but quickly changed to a warm smile. Zora placed her hand on Mel’s. She kissed her on the forehead and, with her thumb, wiped the lipstick it left behind. Their attention turned to the wine. Mel laughed loudly at something Zora said. Christopher smirked at Mel. “Idiot,” he said under his breath. Allen shot him a look.
The evening continued as if nothing had happened. The dining room table was set, complete with two flower arrangements. Allen and Christopher sat at opposite ends of the table. Eric and Meghan sat on one side and Mel and Zora on the other.
Mel asked Eric, “How long have you two been together?”
Eric lifted Meghan’s hand from under the table and kissed it. “Two years. The first time I saw Meghan, I was hooked. I couldn’t take my eyes off her. Then she turned and looked at me and smiled. I couldn’t believe it. Everything came into focus. People say things like the sky is bluer, the birds sing more sweetly, and that is the truth. She was just what I needed in my life,” Eric said and leaned in for a kiss.

PART ONE — HER STYLE
Chapter 1—September 6th, 1972
The night breeze was a welcome sensation after spending six hours working up a sweat cleaning one of the NYU buildings off Washington Square. This seedy side of town always put Melanie on edge. The drenched bandana covering her hair would stay in place until she was safely back in her room. Reaching into her purple bag, she found her keys. Before putting one foot on the sidewalk, she made sure the keys were spread apart and protruding between her fingers.
The walk to the Village Plaza Hotel took as long as smoking one cigarette, three quarters if she was nervous. Three drags in, she heard a low, angry voice. A lighter voice responded as if confused. In the darkness of a doorway off to the left, Melanie could make out a large man hanging over a smaller person.
“Faggot, yer gonna get yer fuckin’ ass kicked,” he growled while raising his massive fist back over his shoulder. It was then that Mel realized the smaller person was a man trying to cover his head with his hands.
Quickly, she stepped toward them. “Honey, where have you been?” she asked, pulling the bandana off her head. The growler, still clenching his fist, turned to look at her. For just a few seconds, he stared at her. Her dirty bell-bottoms and loosely fitting t-shirt covering her slender body did not distract him from the long, curly-cue, strawberry blonde hair that framed her beautiful face and fell to her elbows. With one hand on her hip, she flicked the cigarette to the side. For a fleeting moment, the only sounds were a few crickets communicating with each other. She took that time to smile and step toward him. When she was close enough to see him begin to smile back, her right arm swung around, connecting with his left cheek and eye. The punch itself was not remarkable, but the keys split his face and it had begun to bleed. He lost his balance just enough to allow her to finish the job by kneeing him in the groin. He yelped in pain as he fell over, clutching his crotch. Placing her arm under the light voiced man’s arm, she brought him to his feet.
All he could do was stare at her. Not for her hair and sweet face, but because he was dumbstruck. He’d seen only one other woman fight like that.
Grabbing his hand, they ran down Washington Place. Twice, she looked back to see if the beast was behind them. Tugging him to the right, they ran into the hotel. The man behind the desk in the lobby yelled, “Where are you going?”
“It’s me, Melanie, Mr. Jones.” The three flights of stairs took the last of her energy. Looking back over her shoulder, she felt a little safer. She had not let go of his hand. At times, he’d run right beside her, others ahead of her. They stopped on the third floor. She let go of him and bent over, hands on her knees, trying to catch her breath. With a sweeping motion, she tossed her hair back and stood upright. In front of her darkened doorway, she finally looked over at him. Once her eyes adjusted to the light, she saw his face. In the shadows of a dimly lit bare bulb screwed into the ceiling, she could see his smile. He leaned against the wall with his hand shaking against his chest.
“You’ll be OK,” she tried to say in a calm voice.
His long, dark brown, shiny hair fell in layers just below his shoulders. A pair of Aviator prescription glasses rested on his significant and masculine nose. Eyeliner enhanced his almond-shaped brown eyes and long lashes. Her eyes fell to his mouth, and she couldn’t help but stare at his lips. They were the kind that made women jealous. Both the top and bottom were full. The deep dimples were like perpetual parentheses on the edges of that extraordinary mouth. Once he stood up straight, Melanie guessed he was only a few inches taller than her, putting him at about 5’11”. A bead of blood rolled down over his eyelid.
“Looks like he got a punch in.” She handed him a tissue from her bag, put her blood-covered door key in the worn lock and opened it. He followed her inside.
The kitchen was no more than an area in the otherwise Lilliputian room. She pulled the only chair from the tiny table and motioned for him to sit.
“What’s your name?” she asked as she rinsed off her keys.
“Allen. Shandi.”
She smiled. “Like the beer?”
“No,” he smiled, “as in boisterous.” He looked around the room. It was shabby but clean. Not like anything he’d ever experienced. “And what is your name? I heard you say, ‘Melanie.’”
“Yeah. Melanie. Mel. Foster.”
“As in cultivate?”
“Nah. Like the Grant’s.”
His laugh was light and feminine. Mel pulled a small container from under the twin bed and put it on the threadbare rug next to him. Inside was an assortment of necessities. It contained a sewing needle stuck in a spool of white thread, a hammer, a box of band-aids, a roll of tape, and a small glass container of hydrogen peroxide. She retrieved a band-aid and the bottle.
“Would you take off your glasses, please?”
“Truth be told, my vision is horrible. I can only see about a foot in front of me without them,” he told her.
“I’d like to clean out that cut. That bastard was filthy. It wouldn’t surprise me if you caught something just by breathing in the same space as that creep did. Your glasses could use a wipe, too.” He removed them and tilted his head towards her. “This might sting a bit,” Mel warned. She lifted his thick hair away from his forehead. The aroma of pot and sandalwood floated up to her and it made her smile. She lightly patted his head with a paper towel with the tiniest bit of hydrogen peroxide.
“Jesus!” He winced.
“I’m sorry,” she said, and blew on the cut.
“I haven’t thanked you for saving me from that Neanderthal. What would ever make you go after something that size?”
She paused. “The ‘f’ word.”
“Fuck?”
“Faggot.” The very word made her purse her lips. “May I have your glasses?” She took them, gave them a quick cleaning on her shirt, and held them out to him.
He reached for her hand holding the paper towel, but she quickly pulled away. He was startled by her reaction. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean anything by it,” he said. “I should go. Thank you for your care and time.” He put his glasses back on, then got up and walked to the door.
She was still holding the bloodied paper towel as he closed the door behind him. Her head fell back. “Oh, good Christ,” she said, disappointed in herself. “Let it go!” she whispered.
Once she’d quickly washed the dirty coffee cup from that morning and rinsed herself off in front of the sink, she fell onto the bed. The sounds of New York City outside her window had finally become familiar to her. That was not what kept her from relaxing. The image of his face kept returning to her. Allen was beautiful. He’s gay. She punched her pillow in hopes of making it more comfortable and closed her eyes. Tomorrow is Saturday. She began a mental list of things to do. Things like laundry and groceries and such needed to be done. But then, she heard his laugh in her head. Her eyes opened, and she sighed. There will not be much in the way of sleep tonight. “Happy birthday to me,” she whispered.
Chapter 2
It was nearly noon when she opened her eyes. A light knock on the door startled her. She jumped out of bed and put on her robe.
“Who’s there?”
“I have a delivery for Miss Grant,” a deep voice said.
“Miss Grant?” she whispered, and then it clicked. “Hold on.” Grabbing her bag off the floor, she searched inside until she found a quarter at the bottom. Pulling the door open just a crack, she could see an enormous assortment of purple and white flowers. She opened it wide enough to take them. Slowly, the bouquet lowered, and Allen’s eyes came into view. He playfully batted them at her.
She laughed. “What’s this?”
“It’s just a modest gift in appreciation of your bravery. Also…” He handed her a large, beautifully wrapped box. She took it from him.
“Come on in, please. You didn’t have to do this.”
He placed the flowers on the tiny table, then turned to her. After adjusting his glasses against his nose, Allen stood with his hands behind his back. His skin-tight, shiny black jeans flared out into a modest bell. The shoes looked like women’s leather square-toed chunky-heeled pumps, but he made them look great. The tan tank top was sheer enough that the hair on his chest and the outline of his nipples were evident. Around his neck he wore a slender black leather tie that was loosened and hung low on his chest. The knot itself was strange. A black silk scarf was wrapped several times around his left wrist and tied, leaving the ends hanging about six inches.
She sat on the bed, pulled off the wrapping, and lifted the lid. Inside was a proper first aid kit, a sewing kit complete with scissors, and a few smaller tools complete with two kinds of screwdrivers, a tape measure, pliers and an adjustable wrench.
“This is too much!”
He sat near her and took out an ‘L’ shaped piece of metal and examined it. “What is this?”
“It’s an Allen wrench,” she laughed. His smile disappeared, and he placed it back in the box. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to….” Tentatively, she patted his shoulder and rose from the bed. “Would you like a cup of coffee? All I have is instant.” She clutched her robe at the neck and started to open one of the two cabinets.
“I was hoping I could take you out for a bite. It’s a lovely day. We could walk a bit if you’d like.” Mel did not answer. “We could take a cab if you prefer.”
“I…I don’t have any clean clothes. Today is laundry day for me. Can I take a raincheck?” she finally asked, not meeting his eye as her face reddened.
“Well, this is all too perfect! How long will it take for you to put on whatever you would have worn to the laundromat? In 15 minutes, I’ll have a cab out front, alright?”
“I don’t…”
“Please?” He held out his hand. She looked down, smiled and swatted her fingertips with his.
“Alright, then. Meet me outside in fifteen minutes,” Allen said with a smile. Just before he closed the door, he looked back at her, flashed that incredible smile again, and gave a quick nod in a way that somehow relaxed any of her suspicious feelings.
She lifted a pair of hip huggers from the top of a pile of clothes in her closet and shook them out. Her only clean shirt was a lilac sleeveless turtleneck her brother made for her. She brushed her teeth with one hand and ran her fingers through her thick hair with the other. Laying out two pieces of bread on the counter, she assembled a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. She rinsed out the paper coffee cup she’d saved from the day before and filled it with milk. The lid still fit. There were far too many beautiful flowers in her bouquet not to share. She chose three cosmoses, cut the stems, and set them in a little water-filled jelly jar. Splashing water on her face, she looked at her reflection in the aged mirror on the wall. As ready as I’ll ever be. Taking a deep breath, Melanie slung her bag over her shoulder. She tried to walk calmly down the three flights of stairs.
Through the dirty front door window, she could see Allen leaning on a cab, chatting with the driver. Just then, a tall blonde man walked by them. Both heads swiveled, taking a long look at his ass. She had to chuckle.
“I’d check that out myself,” she whispered.
The day was quite a bit cooler than the day before. Allen took a cigarette from his pocket, along with a gold lighter. As he lit up, he saw Melanie walking toward him. She turned to the homeless man sitting up against the building. “Fred, here’s a little something to eat. Would you save me the glass?” He reached out for the paper bag and cup. With his free hand, he took hers and kissed it. Mumbling something unintelligible to her, she smiled and gave him the flowers.
He placed them up against his leg, cupped his hand around the glass and admired his gift.
A breeze drifted down the street. Melanie’s nipples shriveled from the cold air. Her knee-jerk reaction was to draw her arms up to her chest. Allen noticed and immediately felt embarrassed for her.
A policeman walked by them and stopped to observe Allen. He grabbed Mel’s hand, opened the door to the cab, and helped her in. Walking to the other side, Allen kept an eye on him. He tipped an imaginary cap to the officer and climbed inside. “Broome and Mercer,” he directed and turned to her. “You are adorable!” he said, smiling at Mel. The cabbie stared at him through the rearview mirror.
“Where were you coming from last night?” he asked her.
“My job. I didn’t ask you how your head is.”
He smiled. “It’s fine. Where do you work?”
“In the evenings, I clean some of the buildings at NYU.” She lifted his hair away from the cut. Clicking her tongue at the sight of the half dollar sized bruise developing, she asked, “Did you ice this?”
“No. How old are you?”
“20. And you?”
“24. Where are you from originally?”
“Upstate New York. A tiny town no one’s ever heard of.”
“Is that where you learned to fight?” he asked with a smile.
The color seemed to drain from her face. A silence hung between them until the cab hit a pothole that sent them both leaning hard to the right. She caught Allen as he fell against her.
Her loud, nervous laugh made its debut, and it certainly could draw attention.
“Oh my! Well, I love that sound!” he said.
The cab pulled over and made a hard stop. “Broome and Mercer, Mr. Shandi.” Allen’s tight pants forced him to lean to the left awkwardly. Jamming his right hand in his front pocket, he retrieved a bundle of bills. Mel glanced down at his hands. The bulge to the left of the bottom of his zipper caught her off guard. She very quickly looked away. He gave the cabbie a $5 tip.
“Thank you, Mr. Shandi!” His hand began to tremble as he put his money away. She took notice, and he caught that. He exited, went to her side of the cab and opened the door. Offering her his left hand, he helped her climb out.
“Are you hungry? I’m hungry. Let’s get lunch. My treat,” he said, looking across the street. He grabbed her hand and they sprinted through the traffic. Horns began honking, and a few cars stopped short. He held his hand up in a thanks gesture. She loved the way his hair bounced as he trotted. They entered a narrow eatery. A decidedly gay man welcomed Allen.
“Mr. Shandi, it’s so good to see you again. Your table is ready.” Other couples that had been waiting were not regulars or did not carry the same weight as Allen. She did not know what to make of this.
They were seated across from one another in a dark and quiet corner. Paper menus were brought to the table by a pretty young lady. “What can I get you to drink, Mr. Shandi?” she asked in a coquettish manner. She reached past Melanie’s face to light the candle and replaced the dirty ashtray with a clean one.
“What would you like, Mel?”
No one had called her that in at least five years.
“Coffee please, with milk?” she asked, looking at the waitress.
“I’ll have the same.”
The waitress placed her hand on his shoulder and said, “You’ve got it, Honey.” She walked away with quite a sway in her hips. Mel grinned and looked over to see Allen reaching for her over the table. He took a lock of her curly hair and rolled it between his fingers.
“If mermaids were real, this is the kind of hair they would have.”
She laughed as her face turned red. “Wow. I’ve never heard that before.” The art that was curiously placed up against the wall caught her eye. One piece in particular stood out. “Take a peek at that one! It’s a kaleidoscope!” She turned her attention back to his face. He’d been staring at her. Feeling embarrassed, she pretended to go over the menu. “Where are you from?” Mel asked.
“I’m not an interesting person,” he said while lighting a cigarette. “Would you like one?” he offered.
“No, thanks. I don’t want to hear your deepest, darkest secrets. How about, what do you do for a living? I feel like I’m the only one not in on it. Everybody knows you. I’ve lived here for five months, and I have no idea what you do or why you are so,” she paused, “beloved.”
“Beloved. That’s interesting.” He propped up his elbow on the table, and he rested his chin in his hand. The smoke from his cigarette curled up around his face. She sat back in the chair and crossed her ankle over her knee. Lacing her fingers together, she rested her hands in her lap. Giving him an “I’ve got all day” look, she took a deep breath.
Tapping his cigarette on the ashtray, he asked, “Have you ever heard of a clothing line called ‘Cleo’?”
“Yes. Do you work for her?”
“Well, I am her, so to speak. I named it after a knot I created for a necktie.” He pointed to the one that hung from his neck. It almost appeared to be a braid, and yet it was not. “The business has been open for three and a half years. It was perfect timing for my vision of what young women wanted. And the rest as they say…” he laughed, waving his cigarette in the air.
The waitress returned with the coffee. “Have you decided what you’d like to eat?” she asked, staring directly at Allen.
“Not really. Can we have a few more minutes?”
“Sure, Honey,” she answered and sashayed away, stopping once to look over her shoulder at Allen. But his thoughts were elsewhere.
“Have you always known you were…a visionary?” Mel asked as she stirred her coffee.
Allen glanced around to see if anyone was within earshot. He whispered, “What exactly are you asking?”
“My brother made this top for me. Not really my style, but he made it with love.” She gently touched the gauzy fabric around her neck. “Ben knew he was gay from the time he was a little boy,” Mel said softly. Her eyes welled up. “My mother simply ignored that fact. My father had an altogether different take on Ben. The things he would punish him for, well, it would just break your heart. That bastard took off in 1965. Good riddance.”
“Where is Ben now?”
“Buried in the Oswegatchie Cemetery outside of Fine, NY. Fine, NY! Funny, huh?” she laughed to cover the sadness.
More customers had begun to fill the place. The waitress returned once more. “What will it be?” she asked.
“Mel?” he asked.
She kept her head down and asked, “May I have a burger?” A tear rolled down her nose and fell on the menu.
“I’ll have the same,” he said. The waitress jotted it down as she walked away.
He gave Mel his napkin. “Dry your eyes, Sweetness,” then moved to a chair next to her and put his arm around her shoulders. “There are souls that are just too beautiful for this world,” he whispered in her ear. She had thought the very same thing a thousand times.
Two gay teens cautiously approached the table. Mel looked up. “Your fans, Mr. S! If you’ll excuse me…” The young men nearly levitated over a chance to chat with Allen. He watched her walk through a narrow doorway and into the restroom.
Splashing a little water on her face, she looked at her reflection. Her hands gripped the sides of the sink. “Pull it together,” she whispered to herself. Once she’d collected herself with a few deep breaths, she headed back to the table. She stopped and watched Allen as he spoke to them. He listened carefully as they replied and talked about their dreams.
Allen was leaning forward, elbows on his knees and speaking softly. He was incredibly patient as he explained what it took to get where he was. His enormous smile was evidence that he seemed to enjoy this part of his celebrity.
She leaned against the door frame, legs crossed at the ankles, her arms crossed just below her chest.
The two teens stood close to each other. For a second, their pinkies hooked together. Allen grinned. Removing the scarf from his wrist, he tied it around the wrist of the young man on the left, then lifted the tie from his neck and put it on the other fan. He held out his hand to shake theirs.
An older couple seated at a nearby table shook their heads in disapproval. Mel stood and stared at them for a moment, then turned her back and obstructed their view. The boys practically pogoed over to her.
“Johnny, isn’t he amazing?” the shorter of the two asked his boyfriend.
He grinned at Mel and said, “He’s amazing!”
“He certainly is,” she replied. The boys left overwhelmed with joy about what had just happened.
The burgers arrived at the table as Mel sat back down. “Thank you,” she said to the waitress and tried to make eye contact.
Finally, she looked at Mel and said, “You’re welcome.”
“Those kids will be living on that for a long time. That’s just about the sweetest thing I have ever seen,” she told him.
“I could say that about what you did for the guy sitting in front of your building earlier, but I won’t. Mine was sweeter.”
Her laugh reached the customers near the front door. “Sorry,” she said, covering her mouth, trying to muffle the sound. “You are a brat!”
“The boys’ names are Jon and Johnny. Isn’t that sweet? They’re hoping to open a clothing store in the village.” As he set his coffee cup on the saucer, his hand trembled again, rattling both. “Don’t ever apologize for your laugh. I like people that let their emotions out. I’d hate to think what would happen if you tried to hold that inside. It could be catastrophic! Your eyes and brain would be scattered everywhere!” he nearly shrilled, while his hand swiped through the air as if he were carrying a tray of filled coffee cups.
She was about to ask him about his hand, but he stood, excused himself, and headed toward the restroom. His hand, his life. It was quite simply none of her business.
When he returned, they continued to talk for another hour or so. Allen had participated in the Stonewall riots and Mel wanted to learn about every scrap of it.
“I witnessed the woman, Storme DeLarverie, fighting the cops. Some aren’t sure it was her, but I’m convinced it was. When she yelled out to us, ‘Why don’t you guys do something?’ we all went crazy. I guess we all have a boiling point.”
“Truer words, my friend. Ben wanted so much to be a part of it. He never hid who he was. All he ever wanted was to work for, well, someone exactly like you. Damn, you would have loved him,” she said, leaning back in her chair.
“The mob and the cops were involved in the whole thing. Talk about an uphill battle. At that time, the lesbians, queens and gays were not exactly a team.”
“Really? You’d think people treating all of you like dirt would be enough to pull everyone together,” she said.
“Well, to be fair, I’ve seen the same sort of division in the women’s movement.”
“You’re right.” She paused and said, “Things are going to change. They’ve got to. We have no control over who we fall in love with.” She lit one of the two cigarettes she had left. “Would you like one?” she offered. He waved it off. “Do you have somebody special in your life?” she asked.
“Yes, I do. A man named Christopher.” Allen’s eyes lit up.
“How did you meet?”
“Everyone thinks we met at a fashion show. We met while waiting for a cab. Long story short, we ended up sharing one and kept on sharing.”
“How long are the two of you together?”
“Almost a year,” he answered with a smile.
“How did you know it was love?”
“Oh, good Lord. How does anyone ever truly know? I wish I could say that it was love at first sight. Like a bolt of lightning jabbing me in the heart and I would never be the same. I think that’s bull. It never happens that way. How about you? Is there someone special?”
“No,” she said, stood and tossed her bag over her shoulder. She sighed as she thought about the bill. “I don’t even have enough money for a decent tip. I promise I will pay you back.” As she passed the kaleidoscope painting, she stopped to take a closer look but gasped when she saw the price.
He stood and tossed a few bills on the table. As he passed the waitress, he shoved a few additional bills into her pocket. “Thank you, dear.” She smiled at him, then continued to pour coffee into another young man’s cup, flirting away with her latest customer.
It felt good to have something substantial in her stomach for a change. As they left the eatery and headed north, a sophisticated man walked toward them. His Dobermann ignored the noises around him. “Geeze. Check out this beautiful beast,” she gushed. “Excuse me. May I pet him?” she asked the gentleman.
“He can be skittish,” he replied.
Mel held her hand out palm down. She let the dog take its time sniffing, and then she turned her hand over. He began to lick her fingers.
“Well, I’ll be,” said the man.
“My trick is to let them smell me when I just finished eating,” she joked. The gentleman chuckled as he and his pet went on with their walk.
“You like dogs?” Allen asked.
“To be honest, I love them. Dogs are such wonderful creatures. They love you no matter what. That’s hard to find.”
“Let me get a cab.” There were none in sight. While they waited at the curb, a policeman began to cross the street and headed toward them. Allen shoved his hand into his pockets and quietly asked, “Would you take my arm?”
Mel did not realize what was happening but did what he had asked. It was then that she noticed the officer. Mel laid her head on his shoulder and focused her gaze on a couple window shopping across the street. Once he had passed, she removed her arm from his. “I hate that fucking shit,” she hissed. Allen looked down at her face. Her eyes were blazing. He waved down an approaching cab, and they piled in.
“You can’t let it get to you,” he said in a matter-of fact kind of way. He turned his attention to the cabbie and said, “West Central Park and 69th.” This time, she accepted when he offered a cigarette.
Pulling her hair back, she leaned into the lighter’s flame. She sighed. “I’m not able to pay for anything, and it’s driving me nuts. I’m embarrassed,” and sighed again. “As soon as I…”
“Later, OK?” he asked and patted her hand.
She could not help but look up at all the high-reaching buildings that stood in Manhattan. “I can never get over just how immense this place is.” Her head was just about upside down, trying to get the best possible view.
“Yes. You are adorable.” She didn’t hear him. The city and all its energy had her full attention. Allen turned to the gorgeous driver. When they arrived at his address, the cabbie thanked Allen for the tip. He also handed him a slip of paper with his name and number on it.
Allen just smiled and put it in his pocket.
A uniformed doorman held open the heavy glass door. “Good afternoon, Mr. Shandi.”
“Hey there, George. How are Christina and the baby?”
“They are wonderful, thanks for asking.”
“Come on. You must have a picture, yes?”
With that, George pulled his wallet out of his pocket and opened it to a photo.
“Oh,” Allen said with a sigh. “Oh my gosh. They are lovely. Is Penelope about four months old now? Look at these beautiful women, Mel.”
She took the wallet. The woman in the photo looked thrilled to be a mom. Little Penelope’s toothless grin was precious. “You are a very lucky man,” she said placing her hand on her abdomen. Still smiling, she handed it back to him.
“Yes, I am.” George took a few seconds to look at the picture before putting it away.
“By the way, Christopher has taken Daphne for a walk.”
Allen gave him a wink. “Thanks, George.”
The elevator required a unique key to go to the penthouse. Mel and Allen rode it nine floors up. When the elevator doors opened, they stepped into a small area with a large door across the way. He opened it and they entered an extravagant vestibule. Mel had never seen or could even imagine such wealth. An older gentleman greeted Allen with his mail and messages.
He looked inquisitively at Melanie.
Allen said, “This is my sweet friend, Melanie. Mel, this is Quinten. If you need or want anything, this is your man.”
Mel extended her hand out to Quinten and said, “Nice to meet you.” He hesitated and looked at Allen. Allen grinned.
He took her hand and said, “It’s very nice to meet you. Would you prefer Mel or Melanie?”
“Either is fine. May I use the bathroom?”
“Of course, follow me, please.”
The bathroom was straight ahead and to the right. It was below a winding staircase with full bookshelves. Quinten lightly pressed the spine of a red and black book, and a door opened outward. Orange-yellow light spilled out onto the tiled floor.
“I’ve never actually seen a secret door. Very cool! Thank you,” she said and went inside. The dominant color was red, and the accent colors were black, gold and purple. Tiles of red with gold swirls outlined in black covered the bottom half of the walls. The upper half was crimson. She was sure the entire room was larger than her apartment. There were several black and red velvet ottomans and a purple and gold chaise lounge in a sitting area. On the other side of a half wall was the toilet and a bidet alongside it. Over the double sinks hung an enormous mirror with an ornate frame. She set her bag on the black marble counter between the sinks. As she sat on the toilet, she tried to take all of it in. “And this is just the bathroom,” she whispered. Once she’d finished, she washed her hands and raked her fingers through her hair.
Allen was waiting for her. “I’d like to show you something.” They went up the stairs and off to the left. After passing several rooms, Allen held open the door to a bedroom. She flashed him a confused expression.
“Oh! No. This isn’t one of those ‘I’d like to show you my etchings’ snares. I wanted to show you a few things from my collection. It’s through the doorway on the left.”
She did not budge. “Wait here,” he said and disappeared into that room. As he came back, he draped pieces of clothing on hangers across the bed. Spreading them out, he chose a backless sequin-covered halter top jumpsuit in champagne gold. “Isn’t this scrumptious?”
“It’s dazzling. But it’s not my style.”
He looked at the remainder of what was on the bed. “That’s the second time you’ve mentioned your style. What is your style, exactly?”
“I like a less feminine look, you know? I’ve always been a tomboy,” she said timidly. “Do you design things for men?”
The sound of quickly clicking toenails on the wood floor grew louder. With that, a magnificent Rottweiler burst into the room. “Daphne-love!” gushed Allen.
Catching his breath, Christopher followed. He stood over six feet tall, blonde hair parted on the right and trimmed with precision. Although he was slender, he was muscular the way 20-year-old men often are. “I’m back from our daily tug. She is going to pull my arm out one of these days,” he said.
Daphne’s interest shifted to the new scent in the room. Her full tail swished back and forth as she sniffed Mel’s feet and legs.
“Who is this?” Christopher asked, inspecting Mel.
She stuck out her hand, “I’m Mel Foster.” He hesitated for a moment, then took her hand. “It’s very nice to meet you,” she said. Still looking at Christopher, she asked, “Daphne’s tail is intact? I don’t think I’ve ever seen that. She’s a beauty.”
“We got her when she was a pup, and we specifically told them not to do that. It’s unthinkable,” Allen huffed.
Mel was on her knees, along with Christopher, cuddling and scratching her belly. “We had a large dog when I was little. Just a mutt, but at least 100 pounds. My father found a harness for her and it helped when we had to walk her.” Daphne jumped onto Mel knocking her back with her legs folded under her and began licking her face. Mel laughed and hugged her around the neck.
“Daphne!” Allen laughed. “Come! Come here, my girl.” She obediently went to his side.
“May I have a washcloth or something?” Mel asked once Allen had lured Daphne away.
Christopher answered, “Sure.” Mel followed him out of the bedroom and down the hall.
“Second door on the left,” he said with a forced smile.
She pushed the door, but it did not close all the way. Splashing her face with warm soap and water removed the drool from her face. Two black velvet ottomans placed side by side with a tiny table between were in the corner. She sat and took advantage of the small, crystal ashtray. Digging through her bag, she retrieved her last cigarette, matches and a hair clip. Taking a deep drag, she grabbed everything and went to the mirror. With the cigarette hanging from her mouth, she pulled her thick hair and piled it on the crown of her head. The extra-large leather slide barely fit over her mop of curls. She pushed the stick through the holes to secure everything in place. Invariably, five or six tendrils hung down around her neck, dripping down over her back and shoulders. She could hear a discussion growing louder coming from the bedroom. “She will end up becoming just another fag-hag for you. What is this, the fifth? I do not need yet another person hanging around watching us as if you and I were a freakshow,” Christopher said firmly.
“You are wrong about her. She’s one of us. Her ideas about women’s clothing are perfect for what’s down the road,” said Allen.
“Is that how you met her?” There was a pause.
Trying to make her presence known, Mel tugged the door open and stomped heavily onto the floor. Daphne flounced toward her. “I’m going to have to get going, little girl.” Holding either side of her enormous head, she kissed her loudly.
“Your hair. I love it!” declared Allen. “I have a proposal for you, Mel. You brought up a more masculine feel for women’s clothing. Would you help me bring that idea to life?” Allen asked.
“I don’t know the first thing about fashion.”
Christopher laughed, “You’ve got that right.”
“Now, now. Let’s not be bitchy,” said Allen.
Mel motioned toward Christopher while looking at Allen and said, “He understands that I do not…”
“Sometimes, all you need to know is what you like and what you don’t like,” said Allen. “Like art.” He grabbed her hand and led her to the back of the bedroom. After opening the double-door walk-in closet, he began to look through his clothes. He chose a white button-down shirt from his closet. “What would you do with this?” He held it out to her. His right arm was across his chest and was clutching his left bicep. His forearm extended outward with the palm of his hand facing the ceiling, and the shirt dangled from his fingertip. She would come to know this as his “What say you?” pose.
“Seriously?” She exhaled. Taking the shirt from him, she hung it from an indentation on one of the columns of the four-poster bed. Christopher gasped at the thought of damage done to the tiger maple column. “I would make it sleeveless and shorten the front to waist length.” She turned it around. Christopher stepped in and held it for her. “Thanks, Christopher. It could be darted a bit to fit my form, then lengthened the shirttail to fall just passed the…” she patted her rear.
“Ass?” Christopher asked. Allen gave him a look.
“Well, I was gonna say cheeks, but either fit. Split it up the middle to about two inches below the waistline. It would end up kind of like tails on a tux. If you could give it lapels rather than a collar, I think that would be something I’d like.”
“What would you wear with it?” asked Allen.
Taking a moment to think, she finally said, “I would wear straight leg jeans and man boots up to my knees. You know, the kind that you tie up in the front without the spiky heels.”
Allen looked over at Christopher and said, “Do you see what I mean?”
“Do you design clothes also, Christopher?”
He seemed insulted by the question. “I am a model,” he answered in a sharp tone.
“I’m sorry. I don’t read many magazines.” Pointing out her appearance with gesturing hands, she laughed, “Just look at me for crying out loud!”
“I have to give you that,” Christopher said.
“Honey, that’s not…” Allen started to say.
“But it’s funny and appropriate,” answered Mel. “Allen, thanks for all of this. I’ve got to get going.”
A nearly palpable look went from Allen to Christopher. Christopher shrugged his shoulders and said, “OK,” and he left the room.
“This might be forward, but I…we wondered if you would consider staying with us while we take Cleo in this new direction? This place has several empty rooms. But I think you’d truly love the one on the far end.”
“But I haven’t agreed to the clothing thing.”
He ignored her. She followed him to an enormous room down the hallway. Daphne’s toenails let them know she was right behind them. Everything was covered with sheets except the king-size bed. Sliding glass doors on the far side of the room led to a balcony complete with greenery and furniture. The walls were white, and the furniture was in varying shades of red. As the sun fell low in the sky, it cast a fantastic orangey-pink over everything around her, including Allen.
“Isn’t it gorgeous?”
“Yes, but I have a job,” she said.
He came toward her and held her by the shoulders. “This is an opportunity to grow. It will be your job. Name your price.” She was only aware of his hands on her. Everything else was a blur. “Please?” he asked, batting his eyes again. Allen bent down a bit to meet her eye and was inches from her face. “I need you.”
She paused, then finally said, “Yes. Thank you. Allen, I am so grateful…” but the lump in her throat and tears squelched her ability to speak.
Allen threw his arms around her and she pulled away just a bit. He laughed and said, “I’m sorry. I excite easily!”
“Good to know,” she said, patting him on the back. He laughed into her ear. The sensation of his breath on her neck was incredible and alarming at once. “I have one request.”
“Name it.”
She pulled back and placed her hands on his chest. “I am not a huggee, cuddly, touchy-feely person. Please, don’t take it the wrong way. You are such a great guy, a real gentleman. You would never deliberately hurt anyone. It just makes me uncomfortable.”
He looked into her eyes. “Of course, I can respect that.” He backed away. “I understand, you know. Maybe better than most. I was different, too.” She felt light-headed.
“Are you alright?” he asked.
“Yes. I think I need a shower and a good night’s sleep.”
“Can I have Quinten bring you a bite to eat?”
“No, not right now. If I get hungry, I’ll poke around the kitchen, if that’s OK.”
“It’s fine with me, but Quinten gets a bit touchy when his domain is disturbed.”
“I promise I’ll clean up after myself,” she offered.
“Good Lord, woman, I was joking! Feel free to have anything you’d like.” He left her room and closed the door behind him.
Chapter 3
By the next morning, all of Mel’s belongings had been picked up and delivered to the penthouse. That afternoon, Allen purchased a month’s worth of clothing for her right down to her panties, along with a carton of her favorite cigarettes plus several joints. She sat on the edge of the bed surrounded by all of it, including the jelly jar she’d given to Fred and her prized possession. It was an old lockbox. Taking the key out of her bag, she placed the box on her lap and opened it slowly. Lifting the three photographs of her brother, Benjamin, from inside, she traced his face with her finger. It also contained a spool of fishing line. She looked up to see Allen standing in the doorway. She closed the box and set it aside.
“Would you like a hand putting things away?” he asked.
“I can’t accept all of this.”
“Consider it an advance,” he said. “Anything you dislike will be returned, exchanged, whatever.” He walked toward her.
Mel stood and moved toward the middle of the room. “You could have let my friend keep the glass,” she remarked.
“I did something a little better, I think. I hope you agree. Fred now occupies your old apartment, and I’ve paid up for two years. He has several new outfits, a bit of cash, and will be filling in at your old job until you decide what you want to do. I will find another place for you to live if you think this isn’t working out, but I want you to share your ideas with me,” he said in a serious tone.
She turned away from him. “I’m going to do my very best for you. Thank you for giving me this chance.”
He moved toward her, then thought better of it. Quinten knocked on the door frame.
“Excuse me, Sir. How many for dinner tonight?”
“Six, I think. Very casual, OK?” Allen asked.
“Time?”
“Six-thirty.”
“Is there anything, in particular, you would like tonight, Sir?”
“Mel, if you sat down in a restaurant and could have anything you wanted, what would it be?” Allen asked her.
She chuckled. “I feel as if I’m in a dream, or I’m high. Maybe I’ve died and gone to Heaven.” She asked timidly, “Do you like spaghetti and meatballs and maybe a salad?”
“Perfect. Is that doable, Quinten?”
“Of course, Sir. Can I get you anything in the meantime, Miss Melanie?”
“No thanks, and for God’s sake, drop the Miss. You make me feel as if I’m the character in ‘Gone with the Wind’! Or worse, my mother.”
“Quinten, could you give us a minute?”
“Of course,” he said and went downstairs.
Allen sat on the bench at the foot of the bed. His legs crossed at the knee and leaning back on his hands. “Did I tell you how I ended up living here?” he asked Mel. She shook her head, no. He gestured with his hand for her to sit next to him. She sat beside him with her legs apart, her elbows resting on her thighs and hands folded. He brushed her hair over her shoulder.
“I just want to see your face, OK?”
“Yes,” she answered and looked at him.
“My father owned an oil conglomerate. It doesn’t matter which one. They are all greed-factories. He could buy and sell God, or so he said. The best part is that God got the last laugh. One morning he told his secretary that there were to be no phone calls, no interruptions. He had a massive heart attack at his desk while she typed away just outside his door. Side note, she was also his mistress. An hour and a half later, she poked her head in to ask a question. She found him sweat-soaked and face down in a pool of his vomit. The Man upstairs is a funny guy, don’t you agree?”
“I gather you were not close to him?”
“No one was. My father loved money and fucking women. If he could have figured out a way to bang them with a roll of hundreds on his cock, it would have been his ejaculation of a lifetime.”
“Wow,” she chuckled. “How did your mom take it?”
“Poor thing, she loved him and not for his money. She would tell me about the 19-year-old boy she’d met all those years ago. Generous, kind, hardworking and very gentle with her. Somewhere along the line, he soured. He began drinking to excess and worse, hitting her. He became ruthless.”
“Did he know you are gay?”
“I think if he’d spent just a bit of time with me, he would have. But you must be in the same room with a person, look into their eyes, listen to what they say to learn anything. My wonderful mother died two years after my father. Countless homes, cars, all kinds of ‘things’ had become the property of my brother and me. Did I tell you I have a brother? Keith. Funny guy. A good man. Anyway. He and I sold most of it and gave the money to charities for the homeless, hospitals, but the best was handing out money to anyone that looked like they could use it. We knew this would make the old bastard roll in his grave. Even better, we made the donations in his name.”
“Ooooh, you scoundrels. I love it,” she laughed.
“Quinten has been with our family since before I was born. He is an old-fashioned gentleman’s gentleman. He just can’t help himself. I know for certain there were times that he would intercept when that bastard was after my mom. He’d lie and say there was a phone call or news on TV about my father’s company. My father was so drunk he probably could have distracted him with a ring of keys, …like an infant. All that being said, Quinten is who he is, and we accept him that way. Alright?”
Her face was beet red. “Yes. Understood. I’ll make it right.” She looked back on the bed and asked, “I hate to sound like such a girl, but what are you wearing tonight?”
Allen laughed. “How do jeans and a shirt sound? Shoes are optional.”
“Comfortable, thank you.”
Allen’s chef, Wyatt Edmonds, had taken the time to ask Mel about her selection for dinner, right down to the amount of garlic or basil. He stood at six foot four and two hundred forty pounds of muscle. He looked extremely intimidating, but that turned out to be completely wrong. He was a gentle and soft-spoken man. It was moving to see his interest in what would make her happy.
That evening, softly playing jazz hung in the background. Allen and Christopher were in one of two black loveseats in a cozy area of the living room. The other loveseat was directly across from them, with two red high-back chairs between them facing the fireplace. A black lacquered coffee table sat between it all.
The first to arrive were two women that worked in the garment district. Eric had red cropped hair and was wearing a man’s blue button-down shirt tucked into her black jeans with a matching blue belt and sneakers.
Mel asked Eric, “May I ask, do you consider yourself a ‘he’ or ‘she’?”
“He, and thank you for asking.” His girlfriend, Meghan also had red hair, but shoulder length. She wore a short denim skirt, a red sweater and black high heels. After the introductions, Allen offered drinks. Eric would have his usual Pabst Blue Ribbon beer in a pint glass while Meghan preferred white wine. Rather than help, Christopher called out for a vodka and tonic. As Allen gave Eric and Meghan their drinks, he heard the elevator door open and excused himself. Mel went to the bar to make Christopher’s drink. She brought it to him and asked, “What do you think Allen will have?”
“I have no idea,” he answered, not meeting her eyes.
“Mel, meet Zora Preston. She is a buyer for one of the high-end stores on 5th Avenue. Zora, Mel Foster.”
She was a tall, curvy African American woman with a beautiful, giant Afro. She wore a tight-fitting, sleeveless black turtleneck sweater, large gold hoop earrings and a floor-length striped skirt in all the colors of the rainbow. Mel smiled and shook her hand. “Do you prefer Mel or Melanie?” Zora asked in a soft and sexy voice.
“Either is fine.”
“Then, Melanie, it is.”
“Your hair is gorgeous!” Mel gushed.
“As is yours,” she responded, taking a handful and twirling it between her fingers.
“I told her just how beautiful you are, Mel. And did I lie?” Allen asked, holding his hands to her like the statuesque women on game shows would when displaying a new car.
Mel became an entirely new shade of red. “Allen, please.” She laughed and turned to Zora. “If you know Allen at all, then you know how generous he is with his compliments. Zora, what can I get you to drink?”
“I’ll have whatever you’re having,” she smiled, putting her hand on top of Mel’s. The sound of ice cubes clinking together came from Christopher. He’d raised his glass and shook it. Allen snatched it from his hand, then he and Mel went to the bar.
“What’s going on, Allen?”
“I’m sorry for Christopher’s behavior.”
“That’s not what I meant. Why is Zora here?”
“I thought the two of you might hit it off,” he said innocently.
“Oh, good Christ,” she said, leaning on the marble surface. She closed her eyes and said, “Are you under the impression that I am a lesbian?”
“Well, yes.”
“Oh, my God,” she whispered, then laughed. “I can’t be upset with you. A tomboy is a stone’s throw from that. No, I’m not a lesbian. This beautiful woman was brought here as my date?”
“I am so sorry,” he said, thoroughly embarrassed. “Let me talk to Zora.”
“No. That’s OK. Let me,” Mel said. After handing Christopher his drink, she asked, “Zora, would you mind checking out the wine selections?”
“Not at all.”
Allen watched out of the corner of his eye as Mel placed her hand on Zora’s back. Mel smiled at her and spoke softly. A look of confusion came across Zora’s face as Mel spoke but quickly changed to a warm smile. Zora placed her hand on Mel’s. She kissed her on the forehead and, with her thumb, wiped the lipstick it left behind. Their attention turned to the wine. Mel laughed loudly at something Zora said. Christopher smirked at Mel. “Idiot,” he said under his breath. Allen shot him a look.
The evening continued as if nothing had happened. The dining room table was set, complete with two flower arrangements. Allen and Christopher sat at opposite ends of the table. Eric and Meghan sat on one side and Mel and Zora on the other.
Mel asked Eric, “How long have you two been together?”
Eric lifted Meghan’s hand from under the table and kissed it. “Two years. The first time I saw Meghan, I was hooked. I couldn’t take my eyes off her. Then she turned and looked at me and smiled. I couldn’t believe it. Everything came into focus. People say things like the sky is bluer, the birds sing more sweetly, and that is the truth. She was just what I needed in my life,” Eric said and leaned in for a kiss.

PART ONE — HER STYLE
Chapter 1—September 6th, 1972
The night breeze was a welcome sensation after spending six hours working up a sweat cleaning one of the NYU buildings off Washington Square. This seedy side of town always put Melanie on edge. The drenched bandana covering her hair would stay in place until she was safely back in her room. Reaching into her purple bag, she found her keys. Before putting one foot on the sidewalk, she made sure the keys were spread apart and protruding between her fingers.
The walk to the Village Plaza Hotel took as long as smoking one cigarette, three quarters if she was nervous. Three drags in, she heard a low, angry voice. A lighter voice responded as if confused. In the darkness of a doorway off to the left, Melanie could make out a large man hanging over a smaller person.
“Faggot, yer gonna get yer fuckin’ ass kicked,” he growled while raising his massive fist back over his shoulder. It was then that Mel realized the smaller person was a man trying to cover his head with his hands.
Quickly, she stepped toward them. “Honey, where have you been?” she asked, pulling the bandana off her head. The growler, still clenching his fist, turned to look at her. For just a few seconds, he stared at her. Her dirty bell-bottoms and loosely fitting t-shirt covering her slender body did not distract him from the long, curly-cue, strawberry blonde hair that framed her beautiful face and fell to her elbows. With one hand on her hip, she flicked the cigarette to the side. For a fleeting moment, the only sounds were a few crickets communicating with each other. She took that time to smile and step toward him. When she was close enough to see him begin to smile back, her right arm swung around, connecting with his left cheek and eye. The punch itself was not remarkable, but the keys split his face and it had begun to bleed. He lost his balance just enough to allow her to finish the job by kneeing him in the groin. He yelped in pain as he fell over, clutching his crotch. Placing her arm under the light voiced man’s arm, she brought him to his feet.
All he could do was stare at her. Not for her hair and sweet face, but because he was dumbstruck. He’d seen only one other woman fight like that.
Grabbing his hand, they ran down Washington Place. Twice, she looked back to see if the beast was behind them. Tugging him to the right, they ran into the hotel. The man behind the desk in the lobby yelled, “Where are you going?”
“It’s me, Melanie, Mr. Jones.” The three flights of stairs took the last of her energy. Looking back over her shoulder, she felt a little safer. She had not let go of his hand. At times, he’d run right beside her, others ahead of her. They stopped on the third floor. She let go of him and bent over, hands on her knees, trying to catch her breath. With a sweeping motion, she tossed her hair back and stood upright. In front of her darkened doorway, she finally looked over at him. Once her eyes adjusted to the light, she saw his face. In the shadows of a dimly lit bare bulb screwed into the ceiling, she could see his smile. He leaned against the wall with his hand shaking against his chest.
“You’ll be OK,” she tried to say in a calm voice.
His long, dark brown, shiny hair fell in layers just below his shoulders. A pair of Aviator prescription glasses rested on his significant and masculine nose. Eyeliner enhanced his almond-shaped brown eyes and long lashes. Her eyes fell to his mouth, and she couldn’t help but stare at his lips. They were the kind that made women jealous. Both the top and bottom were full. The deep dimples were like perpetual parentheses on the edges of that extraordinary mouth. Once he stood up straight, Melanie guessed he was only a few inches taller than her, putting him at about 5’11”. A bead of blood rolled down over his eyelid.
“Looks like he got a punch in.” She handed him a tissue from her bag, put her blood-covered door key in the worn lock and opened it. He followed her inside.
The kitchen was no more than an area in the otherwise Lilliputian room. She pulled the only chair from the tiny table and motioned for him to sit.
“What’s your name?” she asked as she rinsed off her keys.
“Allen. Shandi.”
She smiled. “Like the beer?”
“No,” he smiled, “as in boisterous.” He looked around the room. It was shabby but clean. Not like anything he’d ever experienced. “And what is your name? I heard you say, ‘Melanie.’”
“Yeah. Melanie. Mel. Foster.”
“As in cultivate?”
“Nah. Like the Grant’s.”
His laugh was light and feminine. Mel pulled a small container from under the twin bed and put it on the threadbare rug next to him. Inside was an assortment of necessities. It contained a sewing needle stuck in a spool of white thread, a hammer, a box of band-aids, a roll of tape, and a small glass container of hydrogen peroxide. She retrieved a band-aid and the bottle.
“Would you take off your glasses, please?”
“Truth be told, my vision is horrible. I can only see about a foot in front of me without them,” he told her.
“I’d like to clean out that cut. That bastard was filthy. It wouldn’t surprise me if you caught something just by breathing in the same space as that creep did. Your glasses could use a wipe, too.” He removed them and tilted his head towards her. “This might sting a bit,” Mel warned. She lifted his thick hair away from his forehead. The aroma of pot and sandalwood floated up to her and it made her smile. She lightly patted his head with a paper towel with the tiniest bit of hydrogen peroxide.
“Jesus!” He winced.
“I’m sorry,” she said, and blew on the cut.
“I haven’t thanked you for saving me from that Neanderthal. What would ever make you go after something that size?”
She paused. “The ‘f’ word.”
“Fuck?”
“Faggot.” The very word made her purse her lips. “May I have your glasses?” She took them, gave them a quick cleaning on her shirt, and held them out to him.
He reached for her hand holding the paper towel, but she quickly pulled away. He was startled by her reaction. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean anything by it,” he said. “I should go. Thank you for your care and time.” He put his glasses back on, then got up and walked to the door.
She was still holding the bloodied paper towel as he closed the door behind him. Her head fell back. “Oh, good Christ,” she said, disappointed in herself. “Let it go!” she whispered.
Once she’d quickly washed the dirty coffee cup from that morning and rinsed herself off in front of the sink, she fell onto the bed. The sounds of New York City outside her window had finally become familiar to her. That was not what kept her from relaxing. The image of his face kept returning to her. Allen was beautiful. He’s gay. She punched her pillow in hopes of making it more comfortable and closed her eyes. Tomorrow is Saturday. She began a mental list of things to do. Things like laundry and groceries and such needed to be done. But then, she heard his laugh in her head. Her eyes opened, and she sighed. There will not be much in the way of sleep tonight. “Happy birthday to me,” she whispered.
Chapter 2
It was nearly noon when she opened her eyes. A light knock on the door startled her. She jumped out of bed and put on her robe.
“Who’s there?”
“I have a delivery for Miss Grant,” a deep voice said.
“Miss Grant?” she whispered, and then it clicked. “Hold on.” Grabbing her bag off the floor, she searched inside until she found a quarter at the bottom. Pulling the door open just a crack, she could see an enormous assortment of purple and white flowers. She opened it wide enough to take them. Slowly, the bouquet lowered, and Allen’s eyes came into view. He playfully batted them at her.
She laughed. “What’s this?”
“It’s just a modest gift in appreciation of your bravery. Also…” He handed her a large, beautifully wrapped box. She took it from him.
“Come on in, please. You didn’t have to do this.”
He placed the flowers on the tiny table, then turned to her. After adjusting his glasses against his nose, Allen stood with his hands behind his back. His skin-tight, shiny black jeans flared out into a modest bell. The shoes looked like women’s leather square-toed chunky-heeled pumps, but he made them look great. The tan tank top was sheer enough that the hair on his chest and the outline of his nipples were evident. Around his neck he wore a slender black leather tie that was loosened and hung low on his chest. The knot itself was strange. A black silk scarf was wrapped several times around his left wrist and tied, leaving the ends hanging about six inches.
She sat on the bed, pulled off the wrapping, and lifted the lid. Inside was a proper first aid kit, a sewing kit complete with scissors, and a few smaller tools complete with two kinds of screwdrivers, a tape measure, pliers and an adjustable wrench.
“This is too much!”
He sat near her and took out an ‘L’ shaped piece of metal and examined it. “What is this?”
“It’s an Allen wrench,” she laughed. His smile disappeared, and he placed it back in the box. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to….” Tentatively, she patted his shoulder and rose from the bed. “Would you like a cup of coffee? All I have is instant.” She clutched her robe at the neck and started to open one of the two cabinets.
“I was hoping I could take you out for a bite. It’s a lovely day. We could walk a bit if you’d like.” Mel did not answer. “We could take a cab if you prefer.”
“I…I don’t have any clean clothes. Today is laundry day for me. Can I take a raincheck?” she finally asked, not meeting his eye as her face reddened.
“Well, this is all too perfect! How long will it take for you to put on whatever you would have worn to the laundromat? In 15 minutes, I’ll have a cab out front, alright?”
“I don’t…”
“Please?” He held out his hand. She looked down, smiled and swatted her fingertips with his.
“Alright, then. Meet me outside in fifteen minutes,” Allen said with a smile. Just before he closed the door, he looked back at her, flashed that incredible smile again, and gave a quick nod in a way that somehow relaxed any of her suspicious feelings.
She lifted a pair of hip huggers from the top of a pile of clothes in her closet and shook them out. Her only clean shirt was a lilac sleeveless turtleneck her brother made for her. She brushed her teeth with one hand and ran her fingers through her thick hair with the other. Laying out two pieces of bread on the counter, she assembled a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. She rinsed out the paper coffee cup she’d saved from the day before and filled it with milk. The lid still fit. There were far too many beautiful flowers in her bouquet not to share. She chose three cosmoses, cut the stems, and set them in a little water-filled jelly jar. Splashing water on her face, she looked at her reflection in the aged mirror on the wall. As ready as I’ll ever be. Taking a deep breath, Melanie slung her bag over her shoulder. She tried to walk calmly down the three flights of stairs.
Through the dirty front door window, she could see Allen leaning on a cab, chatting with the driver. Just then, a tall blonde man walked by them. Both heads swiveled, taking a long look at his ass. She had to chuckle.
“I’d check that out myself,” she whispered.
The day was quite a bit cooler than the day before. Allen took a cigarette from his pocket, along with a gold lighter. As he lit up, he saw Melanie walking toward him. She turned to the homeless man sitting up against the building. “Fred, here’s a little something to eat. Would you save me the glass?” He reached out for the paper bag and cup. With his free hand, he took hers and kissed it. Mumbling something unintelligible to her, she smiled and gave him the flowers.
He placed them up against his leg, cupped his hand around the glass and admired his gift.
A breeze drifted down the street. Melanie’s nipples shriveled from the cold air. Her knee-jerk reaction was to draw her arms up to her chest. Allen noticed and immediately felt embarrassed for her.
A policeman walked by them and stopped to observe Allen. He grabbed Mel’s hand, opened the door to the cab, and helped her in. Walking to the other side, Allen kept an eye on him. He tipped an imaginary cap to the officer and climbed inside. “Broome and Mercer,” he directed and turned to her. “You are adorable!” he said, smiling at Mel. The cabbie stared at him through the rearview mirror.
“Where were you coming from last night?” he asked her.
“My job. I didn’t ask you how your head is.”
He smiled. “It’s fine. Where do you work?”
“In the evenings, I clean some of the buildings at NYU.” She lifted his hair away from the cut. Clicking her tongue at the sight of the half dollar sized bruise developing, she asked, “Did you ice this?”
“No. How old are you?”
“20. And you?”
“24. Where are you from originally?”
“Upstate New York. A tiny town no one’s ever heard of.”
“Is that where you learned to fight?” he asked with a smile.
The color seemed to drain from her face. A silence hung between them until the cab hit a pothole that sent them both leaning hard to the right. She caught Allen as he fell against her.
Her loud, nervous laugh made its debut, and it certainly could draw attention.
“Oh my! Well, I love that sound!” he said.
The cab pulled over and made a hard stop. “Broome and Mercer, Mr. Shandi.” Allen’s tight pants forced him to lean to the left awkwardly. Jamming his right hand in his front pocket, he retrieved a bundle of bills. Mel glanced down at his hands. The bulge to the left of the bottom of his zipper caught her off guard. She very quickly looked away. He gave the cabbie a $5 tip.
“Thank you, Mr. Shandi!” His hand began to tremble as he put his money away. She took notice, and he caught that. He exited, went to her side of the cab and opened the door. Offering her his left hand, he helped her climb out.
“Are you hungry? I’m hungry. Let’s get lunch. My treat,” he said, looking across the street. He grabbed her hand and they sprinted through the traffic. Horns began honking, and a few cars stopped short. He held his hand up in a thanks gesture. She loved the way his hair bounced as he trotted. They entered a narrow eatery. A decidedly gay man welcomed Allen.
“Mr. Shandi, it’s so good to see you again. Your table is ready.” Other couples that had been waiting were not regulars or did not carry the same weight as Allen. She did not know what to make of this.
They were seated across from one another in a dark and quiet corner. Paper menus were brought to the table by a pretty young lady. “What can I get you to drink, Mr. Shandi?” she asked in a coquettish manner. She reached past Melanie’s face to light the candle and replaced the dirty ashtray with a clean one.
“What would you like, Mel?”
No one had called her that in at least five years.
“Coffee please, with milk?” she asked, looking at the waitress.
“I’ll have the same.”
The waitress placed her hand on his shoulder and said, “You’ve got it, Honey.” She walked away with quite a sway in her hips. Mel grinned and looked over to see Allen reaching for her over the table. He took a lock of her curly hair and rolled it between his fingers.
“If mermaids were real, this is the kind of hair they would have.”
She laughed as her face turned red. “Wow. I’ve never heard that before.” The art that was curiously placed up against the wall caught her eye. One piece in particular stood out. “Take a peek at that one! It’s a kaleidoscope!” She turned her attention back to his face. He’d been staring at her. Feeling embarrassed, she pretended to go over the menu. “Where are you from?” Mel asked.
“I’m not an interesting person,” he said while lighting a cigarette. “Would you like one?” he offered.
“No, thanks. I don’t want to hear your deepest, darkest secrets. How about, what do you do for a living? I feel like I’m the only one not in on it. Everybody knows you. I’ve lived here for five months, and I have no idea what you do or why you are so,” she paused, “beloved.”
“Beloved. That’s interesting.” He propped up his elbow on the table, and he rested his chin in his hand. The smoke from his cigarette curled up around his face. She sat back in the chair and crossed her ankle over her knee. Lacing her fingers together, she rested her hands in her lap. Giving him an “I’ve got all day” look, she took a deep breath.
Tapping his cigarette on the ashtray, he asked, “Have you ever heard of a clothing line called ‘Cleo’?”
“Yes. Do you work for her?”
“Well, I am her, so to speak. I named it after a knot I created for a necktie.” He pointed to the one that hung from his neck. It almost appeared to be a braid, and yet it was not. “The business has been open for three and a half years. It was perfect timing for my vision of what young women wanted. And the rest as they say…” he laughed, waving his cigarette in the air.
The waitress returned with the coffee. “Have you decided what you’d like to eat?” she asked, staring directly at Allen.
“Not really. Can we have a few more minutes?”
“Sure, Honey,” she answered and sashayed away, stopping once to look over her shoulder at Allen. But his thoughts were elsewhere.
“Have you always known you were…a visionary?” Mel asked as she stirred her coffee.
Allen glanced around to see if anyone was within earshot. He whispered, “What exactly are you asking?”
“My brother made this top for me. Not really my style, but he made it with love.” She gently touched the gauzy fabric around her neck. “Ben knew he was gay from the time he was a little boy,” Mel said softly. Her eyes welled up. “My mother simply ignored that fact. My father had an altogether different take on Ben. The things he would punish him for, well, it would just break your heart. That bastard took off in 1965. Good riddance.”
“Where is Ben now?”
“Buried in the Oswegatchie Cemetery outside of Fine, NY. Fine, NY! Funny, huh?” she laughed to cover the sadness.
More customers had begun to fill the place. The waitress returned once more. “What will it be?” she asked.
“Mel?” he asked.
She kept her head down and asked, “May I have a burger?” A tear rolled down her nose and fell on the menu.
“I’ll have the same,” he said. The waitress jotted it down as she walked away.
He gave Mel his napkin. “Dry your eyes, Sweetness,” then moved to a chair next to her and put his arm around her shoulders. “There are souls that are just too beautiful for this world,” he whispered in her ear. She had thought the very same thing a thousand times.
Two gay teens cautiously approached the table. Mel looked up. “Your fans, Mr. S! If you’ll excuse me…” The young men nearly levitated over a chance to chat with Allen. He watched her walk through a narrow doorway and into the restroom.
Splashing a little water on her face, she looked at her reflection. Her hands gripped the sides of the sink. “Pull it together,” she whispered to herself. Once she’d collected herself with a few deep breaths, she headed back to the table. She stopped and watched Allen as he spoke to them. He listened carefully as they replied and talked about their dreams.
Allen was leaning forward, elbows on his knees and speaking softly. He was incredibly patient as he explained what it took to get where he was. His enormous smile was evidence that he seemed to enjoy this part of his celebrity.
She leaned against the door frame, legs crossed at the ankles, her arms crossed just below her chest.
The two teens stood close to each other. For a second, their pinkies hooked together. Allen grinned. Removing the scarf from his wrist, he tied it around the wrist of the young man on the left, then lifted the tie from his neck and put it on the other fan. He held out his hand to shake theirs.
An older couple seated at a nearby table shook their heads in disapproval. Mel stood and stared at them for a moment, then turned her back and obstructed their view. The boys practically pogoed over to her.
“Johnny, isn’t he amazing?” the shorter of the two asked his boyfriend.
He grinned at Mel and said, “He’s amazing!”
“He certainly is,” she replied. The boys left overwhelmed with joy about what had just happened.
The burgers arrived at the table as Mel sat back down. “Thank you,” she said to the waitress and tried to make eye contact.
Finally, she looked at Mel and said, “You’re welcome.”
“Those kids will be living on that for a long time. That’s just about the sweetest thing I have ever seen,” she told him.
“I could say that about what you did for the guy sitting in front of your building earlier, but I won’t. Mine was sweeter.”
Her laugh reached the customers near the front door. “Sorry,” she said, covering her mouth, trying to muffle the sound. “You are a brat!”
“The boys’ names are Jon and Johnny. Isn’t that sweet? They’re hoping to open a clothing store in the village.” As he set his coffee cup on the saucer, his hand trembled again, rattling both. “Don’t ever apologize for your laugh. I like people that let their emotions out. I’d hate to think what would happen if you tried to hold that inside. It could be catastrophic! Your eyes and brain would be scattered everywhere!” he nearly shrilled, while his hand swiped through the air as if he were carrying a tray of filled coffee cups.
She was about to ask him about his hand, but he stood, excused himself, and headed toward the restroom. His hand, his life. It was quite simply none of her business.
When he returned, they continued to talk for another hour or so. Allen had participated in the Stonewall riots and Mel wanted to learn about every scrap of it.
“I witnessed the woman, Storme DeLarverie, fighting the cops. Some aren’t sure it was her, but I’m convinced it was. When she yelled out to us, ‘Why don’t you guys do something?’ we all went crazy. I guess we all have a boiling point.”
“Truer words, my friend. Ben wanted so much to be a part of it. He never hid who he was. All he ever wanted was to work for, well, someone exactly like you. Damn, you would have loved him,” she said, leaning back in her chair.
“The mob and the cops were involved in the whole thing. Talk about an uphill battle. At that time, the lesbians, queens and gays were not exactly a team.”
“Really? You’d think people treating all of you like dirt would be enough to pull everyone together,” she said.
“Well, to be fair, I’ve seen the same sort of division in the women’s movement.”
“You’re right.” She paused and said, “Things are going to change. They’ve got to. We have no control over who we fall in love with.” She lit one of the two cigarettes she had left. “Would you like one?” she offered. He waved it off. “Do you have somebody special in your life?” she asked.
“Yes, I do. A man named Christopher.” Allen’s eyes lit up.
“How did you meet?”
“Everyone thinks we met at a fashion show. We met while waiting for a cab. Long story short, we ended up sharing one and kept on sharing.”
“How long are the two of you together?”
“Almost a year,” he answered with a smile.
“How did you know it was love?”
“Oh, good Lord. How does anyone ever truly know? I wish I could say that it was love at first sight. Like a bolt of lightning jabbing me in the heart and I would never be the same. I think that’s bull. It never happens that way. How about you? Is there someone special?”
“No,” she said, stood and tossed her bag over her shoulder. She sighed as she thought about the bill. “I don’t even have enough money for a decent tip. I promise I will pay you back.” As she passed the kaleidoscope painting, she stopped to take a closer look but gasped when she saw the price.
He stood and tossed a few bills on the table. As he passed the waitress, he shoved a few additional bills into her pocket. “Thank you, dear.” She smiled at him, then continued to pour coffee into another young man’s cup, flirting away with her latest customer.
It felt good to have something substantial in her stomach for a change. As they left the eatery and headed north, a sophisticated man walked toward them. His Dobermann ignored the noises around him. “Geeze. Check out this beautiful beast,” she gushed. “Excuse me. May I pet him?” she asked the gentleman.
“He can be skittish,” he replied.
Mel held her hand out palm down. She let the dog take its time sniffing, and then she turned her hand over. He began to lick her fingers.
“Well, I’ll be,” said the man.
“My trick is to let them smell me when I just finished eating,” she joked. The gentleman chuckled as he and his pet went on with their walk.
“You like dogs?” Allen asked.
“To be honest, I love them. Dogs are such wonderful creatures. They love you no matter what. That’s hard to find.”
“Let me get a cab.” There were none in sight. While they waited at the curb, a policeman began to cross the street and headed toward them. Allen shoved his hand into his pockets and quietly asked, “Would you take my arm?”
Mel did not realize what was happening but did what he had asked. It was then that she noticed the officer. Mel laid her head on his shoulder and focused her gaze on a couple window shopping across the street. Once he had passed, she removed her arm from his. “I hate that fucking shit,” she hissed. Allen looked down at her face. Her eyes were blazing. He waved down an approaching cab, and they piled in.
“You can’t let it get to you,” he said in a matter-of fact kind of way. He turned his attention to the cabbie and said, “West Central Park and 69th.” This time, she accepted when he offered a cigarette.
Pulling her hair back, she leaned into the lighter’s flame. She sighed. “I’m not able to pay for anything, and it’s driving me nuts. I’m embarrassed,” and sighed again. “As soon as I…”
“Later, OK?” he asked and patted her hand.
She could not help but look up at all the high-reaching buildings that stood in Manhattan. “I can never get over just how immense this place is.” Her head was just about upside down, trying to get the best possible view.
“Yes. You are adorable.” She didn’t hear him. The city and all its energy had her full attention. Allen turned to the gorgeous driver. When they arrived at his address, the cabbie thanked Allen for the tip. He also handed him a slip of paper with his name and number on it.
Allen just smiled and put it in his pocket.
A uniformed doorman held open the heavy glass door. “Good afternoon, Mr. Shandi.”
“Hey there, George. How are Christina and the baby?”
“They are wonderful, thanks for asking.”
“Come on. You must have a picture, yes?”
With that, George pulled his wallet out of his pocket and opened it to a photo.
“Oh,” Allen said with a sigh. “Oh my gosh. They are lovely. Is Penelope about four months old now? Look at these beautiful women, Mel.”
She took the wallet. The woman in the photo looked thrilled to be a mom. Little Penelope’s toothless grin was precious. “You are a very lucky man,” she said placing her hand on her abdomen. Still smiling, she handed it back to him.
“Yes, I am.” George took a few seconds to look at the picture before putting it away.
“By the way, Christopher has taken Daphne for a walk.”
Allen gave him a wink. “Thanks, George.”
The elevator required a unique key to go to the penthouse. Mel and Allen rode it nine floors up. When the elevator doors opened, they stepped into a small area with a large door across the way. He opened it and they entered an extravagant vestibule. Mel had never seen or could even imagine such wealth. An older gentleman greeted Allen with his mail and messages.
He looked inquisitively at Melanie.
Allen said, “This is my sweet friend, Melanie. Mel, this is Quinten. If you need or want anything, this is your man.”
Mel extended her hand out to Quinten and said, “Nice to meet you.” He hesitated and looked at Allen. Allen grinned.
He took her hand and said, “It’s very nice to meet you. Would you prefer Mel or Melanie?”
“Either is fine. May I use the bathroom?”
“Of course, follow me, please.”
The bathroom was straight ahead and to the right. It was below a winding staircase with full bookshelves. Quinten lightly pressed the spine of a red and black book, and a door opened outward. Orange-yellow light spilled out onto the tiled floor.
“I’ve never actually seen a secret door. Very cool! Thank you,” she said and went inside. The dominant color was red, and the accent colors were black, gold and purple. Tiles of red with gold swirls outlined in black covered the bottom half of the walls. The upper half was crimson. She was sure the entire room was larger than her apartment. There were several black and red velvet ottomans and a purple and gold chaise lounge in a sitting area. On the other side of a half wall was the toilet and a bidet alongside it. Over the double sinks hung an enormous mirror with an ornate frame. She set her bag on the black marble counter between the sinks. As she sat on the toilet, she tried to take all of it in. “And this is just the bathroom,” she whispered. Once she’d finished, she washed her hands and raked her fingers through her hair.
Allen was waiting for her. “I’d like to show you something.” They went up the stairs and off to the left. After passing several rooms, Allen held open the door to a bedroom. She flashed him a confused expression.
“Oh! No. This isn’t one of those ‘I’d like to show you my etchings’ snares. I wanted to show you a few things from my collection. It’s through the doorway on the left.”
She did not budge. “Wait here,” he said and disappeared into that room. As he came back, he draped pieces of clothing on hangers across the bed. Spreading them out, he chose a backless sequin-covered halter top jumpsuit in champagne gold. “Isn’t this scrumptious?”
“It’s dazzling. But it’s not my style.”
He looked at the remainder of what was on the bed. “That’s the second time you’ve mentioned your style. What is your style, exactly?”
“I like a less feminine look, you know? I’ve always been a tomboy,” she said timidly. “Do you design things for men?”
The sound of quickly clicking toenails on the wood floor grew louder. With that, a magnificent Rottweiler burst into the room. “Daphne-love!” gushed Allen.
Catching his breath, Christopher followed. He stood over six feet tall, blonde hair parted on the right and trimmed with precision. Although he was slender, he was muscular the way 20-year-old men often are. “I’m back from our daily tug. She is going to pull my arm out one of these days,” he said.
Daphne’s interest shifted to the new scent in the room. Her full tail swished back and forth as she sniffed Mel’s feet and legs.
“Who is this?” Christopher asked, inspecting Mel.
She stuck out her hand, “I’m Mel Foster.” He hesitated for a moment, then took her hand. “It’s very nice to meet you,” she said. Still looking at Christopher, she asked, “Daphne’s tail is intact? I don’t think I’ve ever seen that. She’s a beauty.”
“We got her when she was a pup, and we specifically told them not to do that. It’s unthinkable,” Allen huffed.
Mel was on her knees, along with Christopher, cuddling and scratching her belly. “We had a large dog when I was little. Just a mutt, but at least 100 pounds. My father found a harness for her and it helped when we had to walk her.” Daphne jumped onto Mel knocking her back with her legs folded under her and began licking her face. Mel laughed and hugged her around the neck.
“Daphne!” Allen laughed. “Come! Come here, my girl.” She obediently went to his side.
“May I have a washcloth or something?” Mel asked once Allen had lured Daphne away.
Christopher answered, “Sure.” Mel followed him out of the bedroom and down the hall.
“Second door on the left,” he said with a forced smile.
She pushed the door, but it did not close all the way. Splashing her face with warm soap and water removed the drool from her face. Two black velvet ottomans placed side by side with a tiny table between were in the corner. She sat and took advantage of the small, crystal ashtray. Digging through her bag, she retrieved her last cigarette, matches and a hair clip. Taking a deep drag, she grabbed everything and went to the mirror. With the cigarette hanging from her mouth, she pulled her thick hair and piled it on the crown of her head. The extra-large leather slide barely fit over her mop of curls. She pushed the stick through the holes to secure everything in place. Invariably, five or six tendrils hung down around her neck, dripping down over her back and shoulders. She could hear a discussion growing louder coming from the bedroom. “She will end up becoming just another fag-hag for you. What is this, the fifth? I do not need yet another person hanging around watching us as if you and I were a freakshow,” Christopher said firmly.
“You are wrong about her. She’s one of us. Her ideas about women’s clothing are perfect for what’s down the road,” said Allen.
“Is that how you met her?” There was a pause.
Trying to make her presence known, Mel tugged the door open and stomped heavily onto the floor. Daphne flounced toward her. “I’m going to have to get going, little girl.” Holding either side of her enormous head, she kissed her loudly.
“Your hair. I love it!” declared Allen. “I have a proposal for you, Mel. You brought up a more masculine feel for women’s clothing. Would you help me bring that idea to life?” Allen asked.
“I don’t know the first thing about fashion.”
Christopher laughed, “You’ve got that right.”
“Now, now. Let’s not be bitchy,” said Allen.
Mel motioned toward Christopher while looking at Allen and said, “He understands that I do not…”
“Sometimes, all you need to know is what you like and what you don’t like,” said Allen. “Like art.” He grabbed her hand and led her to the back of the bedroom. After opening the double-door walk-in closet, he began to look through his clothes. He chose a white button-down shirt from his closet. “What would you do with this?” He held it out to her. His right arm was across his chest and was clutching his left bicep. His forearm extended outward with the palm of his hand facing the ceiling, and the shirt dangled from his fingertip. She would come to know this as his “What say you?” pose.
“Seriously?” She exhaled. Taking the shirt from him, she hung it from an indentation on one of the columns of the four-poster bed. Christopher gasped at the thought of damage done to the tiger maple column. “I would make it sleeveless and shorten the front to waist length.” She turned it around. Christopher stepped in and held it for her. “Thanks, Christopher. It could be darted a bit to fit my form, then lengthened the shirttail to fall just passed the…” she patted her rear.
“Ass?” Christopher asked. Allen gave him a look.
“Well, I was gonna say cheeks, but either fit. Split it up the middle to about two inches below the waistline. It would end up kind of like tails on a tux. If you could give it lapels rather than a collar, I think that would be something I’d like.”
“What would you wear with it?” asked Allen.
Taking a moment to think, she finally said, “I would wear straight leg jeans and man boots up to my knees. You know, the kind that you tie up in the front without the spiky heels.”
Allen looked over at Christopher and said, “Do you see what I mean?”
“Do you design clothes also, Christopher?”
He seemed insulted by the question. “I am a model,” he answered in a sharp tone.
“I’m sorry. I don’t read many magazines.” Pointing out her appearance with gesturing hands, she laughed, “Just look at me for crying out loud!”
“I have to give you that,” Christopher said.
“Honey, that’s not…” Allen started to say.
“But it’s funny and appropriate,” answered Mel. “Allen, thanks for all of this. I’ve got to get going.”
A nearly palpable look went from Allen to Christopher. Christopher shrugged his shoulders and said, “OK,” and he left the room.
“This might be forward, but I…we wondered if you would consider staying with us while we take Cleo in this new direction? This place has several empty rooms. But I think you’d truly love the one on the far end.”
“But I haven’t agreed to the clothing thing.”
He ignored her. She followed him to an enormous room down the hallway. Daphne’s toenails let them know she was right behind them. Everything was covered with sheets except the king-size bed. Sliding glass doors on the far side of the room led to a balcony complete with greenery and furniture. The walls were white, and the furniture was in varying shades of red. As the sun fell low in the sky, it cast a fantastic orangey-pink over everything around her, including Allen.
“Isn’t it gorgeous?”
“Yes, but I have a job,” she said.
He came toward her and held her by the shoulders. “This is an opportunity to grow. It will be your job. Name your price.” She was only aware of his hands on her. Everything else was a blur. “Please?” he asked, batting his eyes again. Allen bent down a bit to meet her eye and was inches from her face. “I need you.”
She paused, then finally said, “Yes. Thank you. Allen, I am so grateful…” but the lump in her throat and tears squelched her ability to speak.
Allen threw his arms around her and she pulled away just a bit. He laughed and said, “I’m sorry. I excite easily!”
“Good to know,” she said, patting him on the back. He laughed into her ear. The sensation of his breath on her neck was incredible and alarming at once. “I have one request.”
“Name it.”
She pulled back and placed her hands on his chest. “I am not a huggee, cuddly, touchy-feely person. Please, don’t take it the wrong way. You are such a great guy, a real gentleman. You would never deliberately hurt anyone. It just makes me uncomfortable.”
He looked into her eyes. “Of course, I can respect that.” He backed away. “I understand, you know. Maybe better than most. I was different, too.” She felt light-headed.
“Are you alright?” he asked.
“Yes. I think I need a shower and a good night’s sleep.”
“Can I have Quinten bring you a bite to eat?”
“No, not right now. If I get hungry, I’ll poke around the kitchen, if that’s OK.”
“It’s fine with me, but Quinten gets a bit touchy when his domain is disturbed.”
“I promise I’ll clean up after myself,” she offered.
“Good Lord, woman, I was joking! Feel free to have anything you’d like.” He left her room and closed the door behind him.
Chapter 3
By the next morning, all of Mel’s belongings had been picked up and delivered to the penthouse. That afternoon, Allen purchased a month’s worth of clothing for her right down to her panties, along with a carton of her favorite cigarettes plus several joints. She sat on the edge of the bed surrounded by all of it, including the jelly jar she’d given to Fred and her prized possession. It was an old lockbox. Taking the key out of her bag, she placed the box on her lap and opened it slowly. Lifting the three photographs of her brother, Benjamin, from inside, she traced his face with her finger. It also contained a spool of fishing line. She looked up to see Allen standing in the doorway. She closed the box and set it aside.
“Would you like a hand putting things away?” he asked.
“I can’t accept all of this.”
“Consider it an advance,” he said. “Anything you dislike will be returned, exchanged, whatever.” He walked toward her.
Mel stood and moved toward the middle of the room. “You could have let my friend keep the glass,” she remarked.
“I did something a little better, I think. I hope you agree. Fred now occupies your old apartment, and I’ve paid up for two years. He has several new outfits, a bit of cash, and will be filling in at your old job until you decide what you want to do. I will find another place for you to live if you think this isn’t working out, but I want you to share your ideas with me,” he said in a serious tone.
She turned away from him. “I’m going to do my very best for you. Thank you for giving me this chance.”
He moved toward her, then thought better of it. Quinten knocked on the door frame.
“Excuse me, Sir. How many for dinner tonight?”
“Six, I think. Very casual, OK?” Allen asked.
“Time?”
“Six-thirty.”
“Is there anything, in particular, you would like tonight, Sir?”
“Mel, if you sat down in a restaurant and could have anything you wanted, what would it be?” Allen asked her.
She chuckled. “I feel as if I’m in a dream, or I’m high. Maybe I’ve died and gone to Heaven.” She asked timidly, “Do you like spaghetti and meatballs and maybe a salad?”
“Perfect. Is that doable, Quinten?”
“Of course, Sir. Can I get you anything in the meantime, Miss Melanie?”
“No thanks, and for God’s sake, drop the Miss. You make me feel as if I’m the character in ‘Gone with the Wind’! Or worse, my mother.”
“Quinten, could you give us a minute?”
“Of course,” he said and went downstairs.
Allen sat on the bench at the foot of the bed. His legs crossed at the knee and leaning back on his hands. “Did I tell you how I ended up living here?” he asked Mel. She shook her head, no. He gestured with his hand for her to sit next to him. She sat beside him with her legs apart, her elbows resting on her thighs and hands folded. He brushed her hair over her shoulder.
“I just want to see your face, OK?”
“Yes,” she answered and looked at him.
“My father owned an oil conglomerate. It doesn’t matter which one. They are all greed-factories. He could buy and sell God, or so he said. The best part is that God got the last laugh. One morning he told his secretary that there were to be no phone calls, no interruptions. He had a massive heart attack at his desk while she typed away just outside his door. Side note, she was also his mistress. An hour and a half later, she poked her head in to ask a question. She found him sweat-soaked and face down in a pool of his vomit. The Man upstairs is a funny guy, don’t you agree?”
“I gather you were not close to him?”
“No one was. My father loved money and fucking women. If he could have figured out a way to bang them with a roll of hundreds on his cock, it would have been his ejaculation of a lifetime.”
“Wow,” she chuckled. “How did your mom take it?”
“Poor thing, she loved him and not for his money. She would tell me about the 19-year-old boy she’d met all those years ago. Generous, kind, hardworking and very gentle with her. Somewhere along the line, he soured. He began drinking to excess and worse, hitting her. He became ruthless.”
“Did he know you are gay?”
“I think if he’d spent just a bit of time with me, he would have. But you must be in the same room with a person, look into their eyes, listen to what they say to learn anything. My wonderful mother died two years after my father. Countless homes, cars, all kinds of ‘things’ had become the property of my brother and me. Did I tell you I have a brother? Keith. Funny guy. A good man. Anyway. He and I sold most of it and gave the money to charities for the homeless, hospitals, but the best was handing out money to anyone that looked like they could use it. We knew this would make the old bastard roll in his grave. Even better, we made the donations in his name.”
“Ooooh, you scoundrels. I love it,” she laughed.
“Quinten has been with our family since before I was born. He is an old-fashioned gentleman’s gentleman. He just can’t help himself. I know for certain there were times that he would intercept when that bastard was after my mom. He’d lie and say there was a phone call or news on TV about my father’s company. My father was so drunk he probably could have distracted him with a ring of keys, …like an infant. All that being said, Quinten is who he is, and we accept him that way. Alright?”
Her face was beet red. “Yes. Understood. I’ll make it right.” She looked back on the bed and asked, “I hate to sound like such a girl, but what are you wearing tonight?”
Allen laughed. “How do jeans and a shirt sound? Shoes are optional.”
“Comfortable, thank you.”
Allen’s chef, Wyatt Edmonds, had taken the time to ask Mel about her selection for dinner, right down to the amount of garlic or basil. He stood at six foot four and two hundred forty pounds of muscle. He looked extremely intimidating, but that turned out to be completely wrong. He was a gentle and soft-spoken man. It was moving to see his interest in what would make her happy.
That evening, softly playing jazz hung in the background. Allen and Christopher were in one of two black loveseats in a cozy area of the living room. The other loveseat was directly across from them, with two red high-back chairs between them facing the fireplace. A black lacquered coffee table sat between it all.
The first to arrive were two women that worked in the garment district. Eric had red cropped hair and was wearing a man’s blue button-down shirt tucked into her black jeans with a matching blue belt and sneakers.
Mel asked Eric, “May I ask, do you consider yourself a ‘he’ or ‘she’?”
“He, and thank you for asking.” His girlfriend, Meghan also had red hair, but shoulder length. She wore a short denim skirt, a red sweater and black high heels. After the introductions, Allen offered drinks. Eric would have his usual Pabst Blue Ribbon beer in a pint glass while Meghan preferred white wine. Rather than help, Christopher called out for a vodka and tonic. As Allen gave Eric and Meghan their drinks, he heard the elevator door open and excused himself. Mel went to the bar to make Christopher’s drink. She brought it to him and asked, “What do you think Allen will have?”
“I have no idea,” he answered, not meeting her eyes.
“Mel, meet Zora Preston. She is a buyer for one of the high-end stores on 5th Avenue. Zora, Mel Foster.”
She was a tall, curvy African American woman with a beautiful, giant Afro. She wore a tight-fitting, sleeveless black turtleneck sweater, large gold hoop earrings and a floor-length striped skirt in all the colors of the rainbow. Mel smiled and shook her hand. “Do you prefer Mel or Melanie?” Zora asked in a soft and sexy voice.
“Either is fine.”
“Then, Melanie, it is.”
“Your hair is gorgeous!” Mel gushed.
“As is yours,” she responded, taking a handful and twirling it between her fingers.
“I told her just how beautiful you are, Mel. And did I lie?” Allen asked, holding his hands to her like the statuesque women on game shows would when displaying a new car.
Mel became an entirely new shade of red. “Allen, please.” She laughed and turned to Zora. “If you know Allen at all, then you know how generous he is with his compliments. Zora, what can I get you to drink?”
“I’ll have whatever you’re having,” she smiled, putting her hand on top of Mel’s. The sound of ice cubes clinking together came from Christopher. He’d raised his glass and shook it. Allen snatched it from his hand, then he and Mel went to the bar.
“What’s going on, Allen?”
“I’m sorry for Christopher’s behavior.”
“That’s not what I meant. Why is Zora here?”
“I thought the two of you might hit it off,” he said innocently.
“Oh, good Christ,” she said, leaning on the marble surface. She closed her eyes and said, “Are you under the impression that I am a lesbian?”
“Well, yes.”
“Oh, my God,” she whispered, then laughed. “I can’t be upset with you. A tomboy is a stone’s throw from that. No, I’m not a lesbian. This beautiful woman was brought here as my date?”
“I am so sorry,” he said, thoroughly embarrassed. “Let me talk to Zora.”
“No. That’s OK. Let me,” Mel said. After handing Christopher his drink, she asked, “Zora, would you mind checking out the wine selections?”
“Not at all.”
Allen watched out of the corner of his eye as Mel placed her hand on Zora’s back. Mel smiled at her and spoke softly. A look of confusion came across Zora’s face as Mel spoke but quickly changed to a warm smile. Zora placed her hand on Mel’s. She kissed her on the forehead and, with her thumb, wiped the lipstick it left behind. Their attention turned to the wine. Mel laughed loudly at something Zora said. Christopher smirked at Mel. “Idiot,” he said under his breath. Allen shot him a look.
The evening continued as if nothing had happened. The dining room table was set, complete with two flower arrangements. Allen and Christopher sat at opposite ends of the table. Eric and Meghan sat on one side and Mel and Zora on the other.
Mel asked Eric, “How long have you two been together?”
Eric lifted Meghan’s hand from under the table and kissed it. “Two years. The first time I saw Meghan, I was hooked. I couldn’t take my eyes off her. Then she turned and looked at me and smiled. I couldn’t believe it. Everything came into focus. People say things like the sky is bluer, the birds sing more sweetly, and that is the truth. She was just what I needed in my life,” Eric said and leaned in for a kiss.
Aurora Carafa
Love All the Way
3 ratings","I absolutely loved the book. I finished it in just three days. Love All the Way is a 346-page novel by Aurora Carafa that beautifully portrays the essence of unconditional love and the challenges it overcomes. The range of emotions I experienced while reading was incredible, from moments of joy shared with the characters to the tears shed alongside them. The book was truly a rollercoaster ride of emotions, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Right from the very first chapter, the book captures your attention, leaving you eagerly anticipating what is to come until the very end. I would rate this book 4 out of 5. My only criticism lies in the dialogue and character development of Mel. Initially portrayed as a strong, independent woman who has endured the worst and survived, as the story progresses, she becomes excessively emotional, feeling sorry for herself and perceiving herself as a burden. This shift in her character made her less likable and 8 unintentional typos throughout the novel. However, despite these minor flaws, I would rate it a 4 out of 4 because I loved the overall story, the meaningful message it conveys, and the experiences and struggles of the characters."

PART ONE — HER STYLE
Chapter 1—September 6th, 1972
The night breeze was a welcome sensation after spending six hours working up a sweat cleaning one of the NYU buildings off Washington Square. This seedy side of town always put Melanie on edge. The drenched bandana covering her hair would stay in place until she was safely back in her room. Reaching into her purple bag, she found her keys. Before putting one foot on the sidewalk, she made sure the keys were spread apart and protruding between her fingers.
The walk to the Village Plaza Hotel took as long as smoking one cigarette, three quarters if she was nervous. Three drags in, she heard a low, angry voice. A lighter voice responded as if confused. In the darkness of a doorway off to the left, Melanie could make out a large man hanging over a smaller person.
“Faggot, yer gonna get yer fuckin’ ass kicked,” he growled while raising his massive fist back over his shoulder. It was then that Mel realized the smaller person was a man trying to cover his head with his hands.
Quickly, she stepped toward them. “Honey, where have you been?” she asked, pulling the bandana off her head. The growler, still clenching his fist, turned to look at her. For just a few seconds, he stared at her. Her dirty bell-bottoms and loosely fitting t-shirt covering her slender body did not distract him from the long, curly-cue, strawberry blonde hair that framed her beautiful face and fell to her elbows. With one hand on her hip, she flicked the cigarette to the side. For a fleeting moment, the only sounds were a few crickets communicating with each other. She took that time to smile and step toward him. When she was close enough to see him begin to smile back, her right arm swung around, connecting with his left cheek and eye. The punch itself was not remarkable, but the keys split his face and it had begun to bleed. He lost his balance just enough to allow her to finish the job by kneeing him in the groin. He yelped in pain as he fell over, clutching his crotch. Placing her arm under the light voiced man’s arm, she brought him to his feet.
All he could do was stare at her. Not for her hair and sweet face, but because he was dumbstruck. He’d seen only one other woman fight like that.
Grabbing his hand, they ran down Washington Place. Twice, she looked back to see if the beast was behind them. Tugging him to the right, they ran into the hotel. The man behind the desk in the lobby yelled, “Where are you going?”
“It’s me, Melanie, Mr. Jones.” The three flights of stairs took the last of her energy. Looking back over her shoulder, she felt a little safer. She had not let go of his hand. At times, he’d run right beside her, others ahead of her. They stopped on the third floor. She let go of him and bent over, hands on her knees, trying to catch her breath. With a sweeping motion, she tossed her hair back and stood upright. In front of her darkened doorway, she finally looked over at him. Once her eyes adjusted to the light, she saw his face. In the shadows of a dimly lit bare bulb screwed into the ceiling, she could see his smile. He leaned against the wall with his hand shaking against his chest.
“You’ll be OK,” she tried to say in a calm voice.
His long, dark brown, shiny hair fell in layers just below his shoulders. A pair of Aviator prescription glasses rested on his significant and masculine nose. Eyeliner enhanced his almond-shaped brown eyes and long lashes. Her eyes fell to his mouth, and she couldn’t help but stare at his lips. They were the kind that made women jealous. Both the top and bottom were full. The deep dimples were like perpetual parentheses on the edges of that extraordinary mouth. Once he stood up straight, Melanie guessed he was only a few inches taller than her, putting him at about 5’11”. A bead of blood rolled down over his eyelid.
“Looks like he got a punch in.” She handed him a tissue from her bag, put her blood-covered door key in the worn lock and opened it. He followed her inside.
The kitchen was no more than an area in the otherwise Lilliputian room. She pulled the only chair from the tiny table and motioned for him to sit.
“What’s your name?” she asked as she rinsed off her keys.
“Allen. Shandi.”
She smiled. “Like the beer?”
“No,” he smiled, “as in boisterous.” He looked around the room. It was shabby but clean. Not like anything he’d ever experienced. “And what is your name? I heard you say, ‘Melanie.’”
“Yeah. Melanie. Mel. Foster.”
“As in cultivate?”
“Nah. Like the Grant’s.”
His laugh was light and feminine. Mel pulled a small container from under the twin bed and put it on the threadbare rug next to him. Inside was an assortment of necessities. It contained a sewing needle stuck in a spool of white thread, a hammer, a box of band-aids, a roll of tape, and a small glass container of hydrogen peroxide. She retrieved a band-aid and the bottle.
“Would you take off your glasses, please?”
“Truth be told, my vision is horrible. I can only see about a foot in front of me without them,” he told her.
“I’d like to clean out that cut. That bastard was filthy. It wouldn’t surprise me if you caught something just by breathing in the same space as that creep did. Your glasses could use a wipe, too.” He removed them and tilted his head towards her. “This might sting a bit,” Mel warned. She lifted his thick hair away from his forehead. The aroma of pot and sandalwood floated up to her and it made her smile. She lightly patted his head with a paper towel with the tiniest bit of hydrogen peroxide.
“Jesus!” He winced.
“I’m sorry,” she said, and blew on the cut.
“I haven’t thanked you for saving me from that Neanderthal. What would ever make you go after something that size?”
She paused. “The ‘f’ word.”
“Fuck?”
“Faggot.” The very word made her purse her lips. “May I have your glasses?” She took them, gave them a quick cleaning on her shirt, and held them out to him.
He reached for her hand holding the paper towel, but she quickly pulled away. He was startled by her reaction. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean anything by it,” he said. “I should go. Thank you for your care and time.” He put his glasses back on, then got up and walked to the door.
She was still holding the bloodied paper towel as he closed the door behind him. Her head fell back. “Oh, good Christ,” she said, disappointed in herself. “Let it go!” she whispered.
Once she’d quickly washed the dirty coffee cup from that morning and rinsed herself off in front of the sink, she fell onto the bed. The sounds of New York City outside her window had finally become familiar to her. That was not what kept her from relaxing. The image of his face kept returning to her. Allen was beautiful. He’s gay. She punched her pillow in hopes of making it more comfortable and closed her eyes. Tomorrow is Saturday. She began a mental list of things to do. Things like laundry and groceries and such needed to be done. But then, she heard his laugh in her head. Her eyes opened, and she sighed. There will not be much in the way of sleep tonight. “Happy birthday to me,” she whispered.
Chapter 2
It was nearly noon when she opened her eyes. A light knock on the door startled her. She jumped out of bed and put on her robe.
“Who’s there?”
“I have a delivery for Miss Grant,” a deep voice said.
“Miss Grant?” she whispered, and then it clicked. “Hold on.” Grabbing her bag off the floor, she searched inside until she found a quarter at the bottom. Pulling the door open just a crack, she could see an enormous assortment of purple and white flowers. She opened it wide enough to take them. Slowly, the bouquet lowered, and Allen’s eyes came into view. He playfully batted them at her.
She laughed. “What’s this?”
“It’s just a modest gift in appreciation of your bravery. Also…” He handed her a large, beautifully wrapped box. She took it from him.
“Come on in, please. You didn’t have to do this.”
He placed the flowers on the tiny table, then turned to her. After adjusting his glasses against his nose, Allen stood with his hands behind his back. His skin-tight, shiny black jeans flared out into a modest bell. The shoes looked like women’s leather square-toed chunky-heeled pumps, but he made them look great. The tan tank top was sheer enough that the hair on his chest and the outline of his nipples were evident. Around his neck he wore a slender black leather tie that was loosened and hung low on his chest. The knot itself was strange. A black silk scarf was wrapped several times around his left wrist and tied, leaving the ends hanging about six inches.
She sat on the bed, pulled off the wrapping, and lifted the lid. Inside was a proper first aid kit, a sewing kit complete with scissors, and a few smaller tools complete with two kinds of screwdrivers, a tape measure, pliers and an adjustable wrench.
“This is too much!”
He sat near her and took out an ‘L’ shaped piece of metal and examined it. “What is this?”
“It’s an Allen wrench,” she laughed. His smile disappeared, and he placed it back in the box. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to….” Tentatively, she patted his shoulder and rose from the bed. “Would you like a cup of coffee? All I have is instant.” She clutched her robe at the neck and started to open one of the two cabinets.
“I was hoping I could take you out for a bite. It’s a lovely day. We could walk a bit if you’d like.” Mel did not answer. “We could take a cab if you prefer.”
“I…I don’t have any clean clothes. Today is laundry day for me. Can I take a raincheck?” she finally asked, not meeting his eye as her face reddened.
“Well, this is all too perfect! How long will it take for you to put on whatever you would have worn to the laundromat? In 15 minutes, I’ll have a cab out front, alright?”
“I don’t…”
“Please?” He held out his hand. She looked down, smiled and swatted her fingertips with his.
“Alright, then. Meet me outside in fifteen minutes,” Allen said with a smile. Just before he closed the door, he looked back at her, flashed that incredible smile again, and gave a quick nod in a way that somehow relaxed any of her suspicious feelings.
She lifted a pair of hip huggers from the top of a pile of clothes in her closet and shook them out. Her only clean shirt was a lilac sleeveless turtleneck her brother made for her. She brushed her teeth with one hand and ran her fingers through her thick hair with the other. Laying out two pieces of bread on the counter, she assembled a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. She rinsed out the paper coffee cup she’d saved from the day before and filled it with milk. The lid still fit. There were far too many beautiful flowers in her bouquet not to share. She chose three cosmoses, cut the stems, and set them in a little water-filled jelly jar. Splashing water on her face, she looked at her reflection in the aged mirror on the wall. As ready as I’ll ever be. Taking a deep breath, Melanie slung her bag over her shoulder. She tried to walk calmly down the three flights of stairs.
Through the dirty front door window, she could see Allen leaning on a cab, chatting with the driver. Just then, a tall blonde man walked by them. Both heads swiveled, taking a long look at his ass. She had to chuckle.
“I’d check that out myself,” she whispered.
The day was quite a bit cooler than the day before. Allen took a cigarette from his pocket, along with a gold lighter. As he lit up, he saw Melanie walking toward him. She turned to the homeless man sitting up against the building. “Fred, here’s a little something to eat. Would you save me the glass?” He reached out for the paper bag and cup. With his free hand, he took hers and kissed it. Mumbling something unintelligible to her, she smiled and gave him the flowers.
He placed them up against his leg, cupped his hand around the glass and admired his gift.
A breeze drifted down the street. Melanie’s nipples shriveled from the cold air. Her knee-jerk reaction was to draw her arms up to her chest. Allen noticed and immediately felt embarrassed for her.
A policeman walked by them and stopped to observe Allen. He grabbed Mel’s hand, opened the door to the cab, and helped her in. Walking to the other side, Allen kept an eye on him. He tipped an imaginary cap to the officer and climbed inside. “Broome and Mercer,” he directed and turned to her. “You are adorable!” he said, smiling at Mel. The cabbie stared at him through the rearview mirror.
“Where were you coming from last night?” he asked her.
“My job. I didn’t ask you how your head is.”
He smiled. “It’s fine. Where do you work?”
“In the evenings, I clean some of the buildings at NYU.” She lifted his hair away from the cut. Clicking her tongue at the sight of the half dollar sized bruise developing, she asked, “Did you ice this?”
“No. How old are you?”
“20. And you?”
“24. Where are you from originally?”
“Upstate New York. A tiny town no one’s ever heard of.”
“Is that where you learned to fight?” he asked with a smile.
The color seemed to drain from her face. A silence hung between them until the cab hit a pothole that sent them both leaning hard to the right. She caught Allen as he fell against her.
Her loud, nervous laugh made its debut, and it certainly could draw attention.
“Oh my! Well, I love that sound!” he said.
The cab pulled over and made a hard stop. “Broome and Mercer, Mr. Shandi.” Allen’s tight pants forced him to lean to the left awkwardly. Jamming his right hand in his front pocket, he retrieved a bundle of bills. Mel glanced down at his hands. The bulge to the left of the bottom of his zipper caught her off guard. She very quickly looked away. He gave the cabbie a $5 tip.
“Thank you, Mr. Shandi!” His hand began to tremble as he put his money away. She took notice, and he caught that. He exited, went to her side of the cab and opened the door. Offering her his left hand, he helped her climb out.
“Are you hungry? I’m hungry. Let’s get lunch. My treat,” he said, looking across the street. He grabbed her hand and they sprinted through the traffic. Horns began honking, and a few cars stopped short. He held his hand up in a thanks gesture. She loved the way his hair bounced as he trotted. They entered a narrow eatery. A decidedly gay man welcomed Allen.
“Mr. Shandi, it’s so good to see you again. Your table is ready.” Other couples that had been waiting were not regulars or did not carry the same weight as Allen. She did not know what to make of this.
They were seated across from one another in a dark and quiet corner. Paper menus were brought to the table by a pretty young lady. “What can I get you to drink, Mr. Shandi?” she asked in a coquettish manner. She reached past Melanie’s face to light the candle and replaced the dirty ashtray with a clean one.
“What would you like, Mel?”
No one had called her that in at least five years.
“Coffee please, with milk?” she asked, looking at the waitress.
“I’ll have the same.”
The waitress placed her hand on his shoulder and said, “You’ve got it, Honey.” She walked away with quite a sway in her hips. Mel grinned and looked over to see Allen reaching for her over the table. He took a lock of her curly hair and rolled it between his fingers.
“If mermaids were real, this is the kind of hair they would have.”
She laughed as her face turned red. “Wow. I’ve never heard that before.” The art that was curiously placed up against the wall caught her eye. One piece in particular stood out. “Take a peek at that one! It’s a kaleidoscope!” She turned her attention back to his face. He’d been staring at her. Feeling embarrassed, she pretended to go over the menu. “Where are you from?” Mel asked.
“I’m not an interesting person,” he said while lighting a cigarette. “Would you like one?” he offered.
“No, thanks. I don’t want to hear your deepest, darkest secrets. How about, what do you do for a living? I feel like I’m the only one not in on it. Everybody knows you. I’ve lived here for five months, and I have no idea what you do or why you are so,” she paused, “beloved.”
“Beloved. That’s interesting.” He propped up his elbow on the table, and he rested his chin in his hand. The smoke from his cigarette curled up around his face. She sat back in the chair and crossed her ankle over her knee. Lacing her fingers together, she rested her hands in her lap. Giving him an “I’ve got all day” look, she took a deep breath.
Tapping his cigarette on the ashtray, he asked, “Have you ever heard of a clothing line called ‘Cleo’?”
“Yes. Do you work for her?”
“Well, I am her, so to speak. I named it after a knot I created for a necktie.” He pointed to the one that hung from his neck. It almost appeared to be a braid, and yet it was not. “The business has been open for three and a half years. It was perfect timing for my vision of what young women wanted. And the rest as they say…” he laughed, waving his cigarette in the air.
The waitress returned with the coffee. “Have you decided what you’d like to eat?” she asked, staring directly at Allen.
“Not really. Can we have a few more minutes?”
“Sure, Honey,” she answered and sashayed away, stopping once to look over her shoulder at Allen. But his thoughts were elsewhere.
“Have you always known you were…a visionary?” Mel asked as she stirred her coffee.
Allen glanced around to see if anyone was within earshot. He whispered, “What exactly are you asking?”
“My brother made this top for me. Not really my style, but he made it with love.” She gently touched the gauzy fabric around her neck. “Ben knew he was gay from the time he was a little boy,” Mel said softly. Her eyes welled up. “My mother simply ignored that fact. My father had an altogether different take on Ben. The things he would punish him for, well, it would just break your heart. That bastard took off in 1965. Good riddance.”
“Where is Ben now?”
“Buried in the Oswegatchie Cemetery outside of Fine, NY. Fine, NY! Funny, huh?” she laughed to cover the sadness.
More customers had begun to fill the place. The waitress returned once more. “What will it be?” she asked.
“Mel?” he asked.
She kept her head down and asked, “May I have a burger?” A tear rolled down her nose and fell on the menu.
“I’ll have the same,” he said. The waitress jotted it down as she walked away.
He gave Mel his napkin. “Dry your eyes, Sweetness,” then moved to a chair next to her and put his arm around her shoulders. “There are souls that are just too beautiful for this world,” he whispered in her ear. She had thought the very same thing a thousand times.
Two gay teens cautiously approached the table. Mel looked up. “Your fans, Mr. S! If you’ll excuse me…” The young men nearly levitated over a chance to chat with Allen. He watched her walk through a narrow doorway and into the restroom.
Splashing a little water on her face, she looked at her reflection. Her hands gripped the sides of the sink. “Pull it together,” she whispered to herself. Once she’d collected herself with a few deep breaths, she headed back to the table. She stopped and watched Allen as he spoke to them. He listened carefully as they replied and talked about their dreams.
Allen was leaning forward, elbows on his knees and speaking softly. He was incredibly patient as he explained what it took to get where he was. His enormous smile was evidence that he seemed to enjoy this part of his celebrity.
She leaned against the door frame, legs crossed at the ankles, her arms crossed just below her chest.
The two teens stood close to each other. For a second, their pinkies hooked together. Allen grinned. Removing the scarf from his wrist, he tied it around the wrist of the young man on the left, then lifted the tie from his neck and put it on the other fan. He held out his hand to shake theirs.
An older couple seated at a nearby table shook their heads in disapproval. Mel stood and stared at them for a moment, then turned her back and obstructed their view. The boys practically pogoed over to her.
“Johnny, isn’t he amazing?” the shorter of the two asked his boyfriend.
He grinned at Mel and said, “He’s amazing!”
“He certainly is,” she replied. The boys left overwhelmed with joy about what had just happened.
The burgers arrived at the table as Mel sat back down. “Thank you,” she said to the waitress and tried to make eye contact.
Finally, she looked at Mel and said, “You’re welcome.”
“Those kids will be living on that for a long time. That’s just about the sweetest thing I have ever seen,” she told him.
“I could say that about what you did for the guy sitting in front of your building earlier, but I won’t. Mine was sweeter.”
Her laugh reached the customers near the front door. “Sorry,” she said, covering her mouth, trying to muffle the sound. “You are a brat!”
“The boys’ names are Jon and Johnny. Isn’t that sweet? They’re hoping to open a clothing store in the village.” As he set his coffee cup on the saucer, his hand trembled again, rattling both. “Don’t ever apologize for your laugh. I like people that let their emotions out. I’d hate to think what would happen if you tried to hold that inside. It could be catastrophic! Your eyes and brain would be scattered everywhere!” he nearly shrilled, while his hand swiped through the air as if he were carrying a tray of filled coffee cups.
She was about to ask him about his hand, but he stood, excused himself, and headed toward the restroom. His hand, his life. It was quite simply none of her business.
When he returned, they continued to talk for another hour or so. Allen had participated in the Stonewall riots and Mel wanted to learn about every scrap of it.
“I witnessed the woman, Storme DeLarverie, fighting the cops. Some aren’t sure it was her, but I’m convinced it was. When she yelled out to us, ‘Why don’t you guys do something?’ we all went crazy. I guess we all have a boiling point.”
“Truer words, my friend. Ben wanted so much to be a part of it. He never hid who he was. All he ever wanted was to work for, well, someone exactly like you. Damn, you would have loved him,” she said, leaning back in her chair.
“The mob and the cops were involved in the whole thing. Talk about an uphill battle. At that time, the lesbians, queens and gays were not exactly a team.”
“Really? You’d think people treating all of you like dirt would be enough to pull everyone together,” she said.
“Well, to be fair, I’ve seen the same sort of division in the women’s movement.”
“You’re right.” She paused and said, “Things are going to change. They’ve got to. We have no control over who we fall in love with.” She lit one of the two cigarettes she had left. “Would you like one?” she offered. He waved it off. “Do you have somebody special in your life?” she asked.
“Yes, I do. A man named Christopher.” Allen’s eyes lit up.
“How did you meet?”
“Everyone thinks we met at a fashion show. We met while waiting for a cab. Long story short, we ended up sharing one and kept on sharing.”
“How long are the two of you together?”
“Almost a year,” he answered with a smile.
“How did you know it was love?”
“Oh, good Lord. How does anyone ever truly know? I wish I could say that it was love at first sight. Like a bolt of lightning jabbing me in the heart and I would never be the same. I think that’s bull. It never happens that way. How about you? Is there someone special?”
“No,” she said, stood and tossed her bag over her shoulder. She sighed as she thought about the bill. “I don’t even have enough money for a decent tip. I promise I will pay you back.” As she passed the kaleidoscope painting, she stopped to take a closer look but gasped when she saw the price.
He stood and tossed a few bills on the table. As he passed the waitress, he shoved a few additional bills into her pocket. “Thank you, dear.” She smiled at him, then continued to pour coffee into another young man’s cup, flirting away with her latest customer.
It felt good to have something substantial in her stomach for a change. As they left the eatery and headed north, a sophisticated man walked toward them. His Dobermann ignored the noises around him. “Geeze. Check out this beautiful beast,” she gushed. “Excuse me. May I pet him?” she asked the gentleman.
“He can be skittish,” he replied.
Mel held her hand out palm down. She let the dog take its time sniffing, and then she turned her hand over. He began to lick her fingers.
“Well, I’ll be,” said the man.
“My trick is to let them smell me when I just finished eating,” she joked. The gentleman chuckled as he and his pet went on with their walk.
“You like dogs?” Allen asked.
“To be honest, I love them. Dogs are such wonderful creatures. They love you no matter what. That’s hard to find.”
“Let me get a cab.” There were none in sight. While they waited at the curb, a policeman began to cross the street and headed toward them. Allen shoved his hand into his pockets and quietly asked, “Would you take my arm?”
Mel did not realize what was happening but did what he had asked. It was then that she noticed the officer. Mel laid her head on his shoulder and focused her gaze on a couple window shopping across the street. Once he had passed, she removed her arm from his. “I hate that fucking shit,” she hissed. Allen looked down at her face. Her eyes were blazing. He waved down an approaching cab, and they piled in.
“You can’t let it get to you,” he said in a matter-of fact kind of way. He turned his attention to the cabbie and said, “West Central Park and 69th.” This time, she accepted when he offered a cigarette.
Pulling her hair back, she leaned into the lighter’s flame. She sighed. “I’m not able to pay for anything, and it’s driving me nuts. I’m embarrassed,” and sighed again. “As soon as I…”
“Later, OK?” he asked and patted her hand.
She could not help but look up at all the high-reaching buildings that stood in Manhattan. “I can never get over just how immense this place is.” Her head was just about upside down, trying to get the best possible view.
“Yes. You are adorable.” She didn’t hear him. The city and all its energy had her full attention. Allen turned to the gorgeous driver. When they arrived at his address, the cabbie thanked Allen for the tip. He also handed him a slip of paper with his name and number on it.
Allen just smiled and put it in his pocket.
A uniformed doorman held open the heavy glass door. “Good afternoon, Mr. Shandi.”
“Hey there, George. How are Christina and the baby?”
“They are wonderful, thanks for asking.”
“Come on. You must have a picture, yes?”
With that, George pulled his wallet out of his pocket and opened it to a photo.
“Oh,” Allen said with a sigh. “Oh my gosh. They are lovely. Is Penelope about four months old now? Look at these beautiful women, Mel.”
She took the wallet. The woman in the photo looked thrilled to be a mom. Little Penelope’s toothless grin was precious. “You are a very lucky man,” she said placing her hand on her abdomen. Still smiling, she handed it back to him.
“Yes, I am.” George took a few seconds to look at the picture before putting it away.
“By the way, Christopher has taken Daphne for a walk.”
Allen gave him a wink. “Thanks, George.”
The elevator required a unique key to go to the penthouse. Mel and Allen rode it nine floors up. When the elevator doors opened, they stepped into a small area with a large door across the way. He opened it and they entered an extravagant vestibule. Mel had never seen or could even imagine such wealth. An older gentleman greeted Allen with his mail and messages.
He looked inquisitively at Melanie.
Allen said, “This is my sweet friend, Melanie. Mel, this is Quinten. If you need or want anything, this is your man.”
Mel extended her hand out to Quinten and said, “Nice to meet you.” He hesitated and looked at Allen. Allen grinned.
He took her hand and said, “It’s very nice to meet you. Would you prefer Mel or Melanie?”
“Either is fine. May I use the bathroom?”
“Of course, follow me, please.”
The bathroom was straight ahead and to the right. It was below a winding staircase with full bookshelves. Quinten lightly pressed the spine of a red and black book, and a door opened outward. Orange-yellow light spilled out onto the tiled floor.
“I’ve never actually seen a secret door. Very cool! Thank you,” she said and went inside. The dominant color was red, and the accent colors were black, gold and purple. Tiles of red with gold swirls outlined in black covered the bottom half of the walls. The upper half was crimson. She was sure the entire room was larger than her apartment. There were several black and red velvet ottomans and a purple and gold chaise lounge in a sitting area. On the other side of a half wall was the toilet and a bidet alongside it. Over the double sinks hung an enormous mirror with an ornate frame. She set her bag on the black marble counter between the sinks. As she sat on the toilet, she tried to take all of it in. “And this is just the bathroom,” she whispered. Once she’d finished, she washed her hands and raked her fingers through her hair.
Allen was waiting for her. “I’d like to show you something.” They went up the stairs and off to the left. After passing several rooms, Allen held open the door to a bedroom. She flashed him a confused expression.
“Oh! No. This isn’t one of those ‘I’d like to show you my etchings’ snares. I wanted to show you a few things from my collection. It’s through the doorway on the left.”
She did not budge. “Wait here,” he said and disappeared into that room. As he came back, he draped pieces of clothing on hangers across the bed. Spreading them out, he chose a backless sequin-covered halter top jumpsuit in champagne gold. “Isn’t this scrumptious?”
“It’s dazzling. But it’s not my style.”
He looked at the remainder of what was on the bed. “That’s the second time you’ve mentioned your style. What is your style, exactly?”
“I like a less feminine look, you know? I’ve always been a tomboy,” she said timidly. “Do you design things for men?”
The sound of quickly clicking toenails on the wood floor grew louder. With that, a magnificent Rottweiler burst into the room. “Daphne-love!” gushed Allen.
Catching his breath, Christopher followed. He stood over six feet tall, blonde hair parted on the right and trimmed with precision. Although he was slender, he was muscular the way 20-year-old men often are. “I’m back from our daily tug. She is going to pull my arm out one of these days,” he said.
Daphne’s interest shifted to the new scent in the room. Her full tail swished back and forth as she sniffed Mel’s feet and legs.
“Who is this?” Christopher asked, inspecting Mel.
She stuck out her hand, “I’m Mel Foster.” He hesitated for a moment, then took her hand. “It’s very nice to meet you,” she said. Still looking at Christopher, she asked, “Daphne’s tail is intact? I don’t think I’ve ever seen that. She’s a beauty.”
“We got her when she was a pup, and we specifically told them not to do that. It’s unthinkable,” Allen huffed.
Mel was on her knees, along with Christopher, cuddling and scratching her belly. “We had a large dog when I was little. Just a mutt, but at least 100 pounds. My father found a harness for her and it helped when we had to walk her.” Daphne jumped onto Mel knocking her back with her legs folded under her and began licking her face. Mel laughed and hugged her around the neck.
“Daphne!” Allen laughed. “Come! Come here, my girl.” She obediently went to his side.
“May I have a washcloth or something?” Mel asked once Allen had lured Daphne away.
Christopher answered, “Sure.” Mel followed him out of the bedroom and down the hall.
“Second door on the left,” he said with a forced smile.
She pushed the door, but it did not close all the way. Splashing her face with warm soap and water removed the drool from her face. Two black velvet ottomans placed side by side with a tiny table between were in the corner. She sat and took advantage of the small, crystal ashtray. Digging through her bag, she retrieved her last cigarette, matches and a hair clip. Taking a deep drag, she grabbed everything and went to the mirror. With the cigarette hanging from her mouth, she pulled her thick hair and piled it on the crown of her head. The extra-large leather slide barely fit over her mop of curls. She pushed the stick through the holes to secure everything in place. Invariably, five or six tendrils hung down around her neck, dripping down over her back and shoulders. She could hear a discussion growing louder coming from the bedroom. “She will end up becoming just another fag-hag for you. What is this, the fifth? I do not need yet another person hanging around watching us as if you and I were a freakshow,” Christopher said firmly.
“You are wrong about her. She’s one of us. Her ideas about women’s clothing are perfect for what’s down the road,” said Allen.
“Is that how you met her?” There was a pause.
Trying to make her presence known, Mel tugged the door open and stomped heavily onto the floor. Daphne flounced toward her. “I’m going to have to get going, little girl.” Holding either side of her enormous head, she kissed her loudly.
“Your hair. I love it!” declared Allen. “I have a proposal for you, Mel. You brought up a more masculine feel for women’s clothing. Would you help me bring that idea to life?” Allen asked.
“I don’t know the first thing about fashion.”
Christopher laughed, “You’ve got that right.”
“Now, now. Let’s not be bitchy,” said Allen.
Mel motioned toward Christopher while looking at Allen and said, “He understands that I do not…”
“Sometimes, all you need to know is what you like and what you don’t like,” said Allen. “Like art.” He grabbed her hand and led her to the back of the bedroom. After opening the double-door walk-in closet, he began to look through his clothes. He chose a white button-down shirt from his closet. “What would you do with this?” He held it out to her. His right arm was across his chest and was clutching his left bicep. His forearm extended outward with the palm of his hand facing the ceiling, and the shirt dangled from his fingertip. She would come to know this as his “What say you?” pose.
“Seriously?” She exhaled. Taking the shirt from him, she hung it from an indentation on one of the columns of the four-poster bed. Christopher gasped at the thought of damage done to the tiger maple column. “I would make it sleeveless and shorten the front to waist length.” She turned it around. Christopher stepped in and held it for her. “Thanks, Christopher. It could be darted a bit to fit my form, then lengthened the shirttail to fall just passed the…” she patted her rear.
“Ass?” Christopher asked. Allen gave him a look.
“Well, I was gonna say cheeks, but either fit. Split it up the middle to about two inches below the waistline. It would end up kind of like tails on a tux. If you could give it lapels rather than a collar, I think that would be something I’d like.”
“What would you wear with it?” asked Allen.
Taking a moment to think, she finally said, “I would wear straight leg jeans and man boots up to my knees. You know, the kind that you tie up in the front without the spiky heels.”
Allen looked over at Christopher and said, “Do you see what I mean?”
“Do you design clothes also, Christopher?”
He seemed insulted by the question. “I am a model,” he answered in a sharp tone.
“I’m sorry. I don’t read many magazines.” Pointing out her appearance with gesturing hands, she laughed, “Just look at me for crying out loud!”
“I have to give you that,” Christopher said.
“Honey, that’s not…” Allen started to say.
“But it’s funny and appropriate,” answered Mel. “Allen, thanks for all of this. I’ve got to get going.”
A nearly palpable look went from Allen to Christopher. Christopher shrugged his shoulders and said, “OK,” and he left the room.
“This might be forward, but I…we wondered if you would consider staying with us while we take Cleo in this new direction? This place has several empty rooms. But I think you’d truly love the one on the far end.”
“But I haven’t agreed to the clothing thing.”
He ignored her. She followed him to an enormous room down the hallway. Daphne’s toenails let them know she was right behind them. Everything was covered with sheets except the king-size bed. Sliding glass doors on the far side of the room led to a balcony complete with greenery and furniture. The walls were white, and the furniture was in varying shades of red. As the sun fell low in the sky, it cast a fantastic orangey-pink over everything around her, including Allen.
“Isn’t it gorgeous?”
“Yes, but I have a job,” she said.
He came toward her and held her by the shoulders. “This is an opportunity to grow. It will be your job. Name your price.” She was only aware of his hands on her. Everything else was a blur. “Please?” he asked, batting his eyes again. Allen bent down a bit to meet her eye and was inches from her face. “I need you.”
She paused, then finally said, “Yes. Thank you. Allen, I am so grateful…” but the lump in her throat and tears squelched her ability to speak.
Allen threw his arms around her and she pulled away just a bit. He laughed and said, “I’m sorry. I excite easily!”
“Good to know,” she said, patting him on the back. He laughed into her ear. The sensation of his breath on her neck was incredible and alarming at once. “I have one request.”
“Name it.”
She pulled back and placed her hands on his chest. “I am not a huggee, cuddly, touchy-feely person. Please, don’t take it the wrong way. You are such a great guy, a real gentleman. You would never deliberately hurt anyone. It just makes me uncomfortable.”
He looked into her eyes. “Of course, I can respect that.” He backed away. “I understand, you know. Maybe better than most. I was different, too.” She felt light-headed.
“Are you alright?” he asked.
“Yes. I think I need a shower and a good night’s sleep.”
“Can I have Quinten bring you a bite to eat?”
“No, not right now. If I get hungry, I’ll poke around the kitchen, if that’s OK.”
“It’s fine with me, but Quinten gets a bit touchy when his domain is disturbed.”
“I promise I’ll clean up after myself,” she offered.
“Good Lord, woman, I was joking! Feel free to have anything you’d like.” He left her room and closed the door behind him.
Chapter 3
By the next morning, all of Mel’s belongings had been picked up and delivered to the penthouse. That afternoon, Allen purchased a month’s worth of clothing for her right down to her panties, along with a carton of her favorite cigarettes plus several joints. She sat on the edge of the bed surrounded by all of it, including the jelly jar she’d given to Fred and her prized possession. It was an old lockbox. Taking the key out of her bag, she placed the box on her lap and opened it slowly. Lifting the three photographs of her brother, Benjamin, from inside, she traced his face with her finger. It also contained a spool of fishing line. She looked up to see Allen standing in the doorway. She closed the box and set it aside.
“Would you like a hand putting things away?” he asked.
“I can’t accept all of this.”
“Consider it an advance,” he said. “Anything you dislike will be returned, exchanged, whatever.” He walked toward her.
Mel stood and moved toward the middle of the room. “You could have let my friend keep the glass,” she remarked.
“I did something a little better, I think. I hope you agree. Fred now occupies your old apartment, and I’ve paid up for two years. He has several new outfits, a bit of cash, and will be filling in at your old job until you decide what you want to do. I will find another place for you to live if you think this isn’t working out, but I want you to share your ideas with me,” he said in a serious tone.
She turned away from him. “I’m going to do my very best for you. Thank you for giving me this chance.”
He moved toward her, then thought better of it. Quinten knocked on the door frame.
“Excuse me, Sir. How many for dinner tonight?”
“Six, I think. Very casual, OK?” Allen asked.
“Time?”
“Six-thirty.”
“Is there anything, in particular, you would like tonight, Sir?”
“Mel, if you sat down in a restaurant and could have anything you wanted, what would it be?” Allen asked her.
She chuckled. “I feel as if I’m in a dream, or I’m high. Maybe I’ve died and gone to Heaven.” She asked timidly, “Do you like spaghetti and meatballs and maybe a salad?”
“Perfect. Is that doable, Quinten?”
“Of course, Sir. Can I get you anything in the meantime, Miss Melanie?”
“No thanks, and for God’s sake, drop the Miss. You make me feel as if I’m the character in ‘Gone with the Wind’! Or worse, my mother.”
“Quinten, could you give us a minute?”
“Of course,” he said and went downstairs.
Allen sat on the bench at the foot of the bed. His legs crossed at the knee and leaning back on his hands. “Did I tell you how I ended up living here?” he asked Mel. She shook her head, no. He gestured with his hand for her to sit next to him. She sat beside him with her legs apart, her elbows resting on her thighs and hands folded. He brushed her hair over her shoulder.
“I just want to see your face, OK?”
“Yes,” she answered and looked at him.
“My father owned an oil conglomerate. It doesn’t matter which one. They are all greed-factories. He could buy and sell God, or so he said. The best part is that God got the last laugh. One morning he told his secretary that there were to be no phone calls, no interruptions. He had a massive heart attack at his desk while she typed away just outside his door. Side note, she was also his mistress. An hour and a half later, she poked her head in to ask a question. She found him sweat-soaked and face down in a pool of his vomit. The Man upstairs is a funny guy, don’t you agree?”
“I gather you were not close to him?”
“No one was. My father loved money and fucking women. If he could have figured out a way to bang them with a roll of hundreds on his cock, it would have been his ejaculation of a lifetime.”
“Wow,” she chuckled. “How did your mom take it?”
“Poor thing, she loved him and not for his money. She would tell me about the 19-year-old boy she’d met all those years ago. Generous, kind, hardworking and very gentle with her. Somewhere along the line, he soured. He began drinking to excess and worse, hitting her. He became ruthless.”
“Did he know you are gay?”
“I think if he’d spent just a bit of time with me, he would have. But you must be in the same room with a person, look into their eyes, listen to what they say to learn anything. My wonderful mother died two years after my father. Countless homes, cars, all kinds of ‘things’ had become the property of my brother and me. Did I tell you I have a brother? Keith. Funny guy. A good man. Anyway. He and I sold most of it and gave the money to charities for the homeless, hospitals, but the best was handing out money to anyone that looked like they could use it. We knew this would make the old bastard roll in his grave. Even better, we made the donations in his name.”
“Ooooh, you scoundrels. I love it,” she laughed.
“Quinten has been with our family since before I was born. He is an old-fashioned gentleman’s gentleman. He just can’t help himself. I know for certain there were times that he would intercept when that bastard was after my mom. He’d lie and say there was a phone call or news on TV about my father’s company. My father was so drunk he probably could have distracted him with a ring of keys, …like an infant. All that being said, Quinten is who he is, and we accept him that way. Alright?”
Her face was beet red. “Yes. Understood. I’ll make it right.” She looked back on the bed and asked, “I hate to sound like such a girl, but what are you wearing tonight?”
Allen laughed. “How do jeans and a shirt sound? Shoes are optional.”
“Comfortable, thank you.”
Allen’s chef, Wyatt Edmonds, had taken the time to ask Mel about her selection for dinner, right down to the amount of garlic or basil. He stood at six foot four and two hundred forty pounds of muscle. He looked extremely intimidating, but that turned out to be completely wrong. He was a gentle and soft-spoken man. It was moving to see his interest in what would make her happy.
That evening, softly playing jazz hung in the background. Allen and Christopher were in one of two black loveseats in a cozy area of the living room. The other loveseat was directly across from them, with two red high-back chairs between them facing the fireplace. A black lacquered coffee table sat between it all.
The first to arrive were two women that worked in the garment district. Eric had red cropped hair and was wearing a man’s blue button-down shirt tucked into her black jeans with a matching blue belt and sneakers.
Mel asked Eric, “May I ask, do you consider yourself a ‘he’ or ‘she’?”
“He, and thank you for asking.” His girlfriend, Meghan also had red hair, but shoulder length. She wore a short denim skirt, a red sweater and black high heels. After the introductions, Allen offered drinks. Eric would have his usual Pabst Blue Ribbon beer in a pint glass while Meghan preferred white wine. Rather than help, Christopher called out for a vodka and tonic. As Allen gave Eric and Meghan their drinks, he heard the elevator door open and excused himself. Mel went to the bar to make Christopher’s drink. She brought it to him and asked, “What do you think Allen will have?”
“I have no idea,” he answered, not meeting her eyes.
“Mel, meet Zora Preston. She is a buyer for one of the high-end stores on 5th Avenue. Zora, Mel Foster.”
She was a tall, curvy African American woman with a beautiful, giant Afro. She wore a tight-fitting, sleeveless black turtleneck sweater, large gold hoop earrings and a floor-length striped skirt in all the colors of the rainbow. Mel smiled and shook her hand. “Do you prefer Mel or Melanie?” Zora asked in a soft and sexy voice.
“Either is fine.”
“Then, Melanie, it is.”
“Your hair is gorgeous!” Mel gushed.
“As is yours,” she responded, taking a handful and twirling it between her fingers.
“I told her just how beautiful you are, Mel. And did I lie?” Allen asked, holding his hands to her like the statuesque women on game shows would when displaying a new car.
Mel became an entirely new shade of red. “Allen, please.” She laughed and turned to Zora. “If you know Allen at all, then you know how generous he is with his compliments. Zora, what can I get you to drink?”
“I’ll have whatever you’re having,” she smiled, putting her hand on top of Mel’s. The sound of ice cubes clinking together came from Christopher. He’d raised his glass and shook it. Allen snatched it from his hand, then he and Mel went to the bar.
“What’s going on, Allen?”
“I’m sorry for Christopher’s behavior.”
“That’s not what I meant. Why is Zora here?”
“I thought the two of you might hit it off,” he said innocently.
“Oh, good Christ,” she said, leaning on the marble surface. She closed her eyes and said, “Are you under the impression that I am a lesbian?”
“Well, yes.”
“Oh, my God,” she whispered, then laughed. “I can’t be upset with you. A tomboy is a stone’s throw from that. No, I’m not a lesbian. This beautiful woman was brought here as my date?”
“I am so sorry,” he said, thoroughly embarrassed. “Let me talk to Zora.”
“No. That’s OK. Let me,” Mel said. After handing Christopher his drink, she asked, “Zora, would you mind checking out the wine selections?”
“Not at all.”
Allen watched out of the corner of his eye as Mel placed her hand on Zora’s back. Mel smiled at her and spoke softly. A look of confusion came across Zora’s face as Mel spoke but quickly changed to a warm smile. Zora placed her hand on Mel’s. She kissed her on the forehead and, with her thumb, wiped the lipstick it left behind. Their attention turned to the wine. Mel laughed loudly at something Zora said. Christopher smirked at Mel. “Idiot,” he said under his breath. Allen shot him a look.
The evening continued as if nothing had happened. The dining room table was set, complete with two flower arrangements. Allen and Christopher sat at opposite ends of the table. Eric and Meghan sat on one side and Mel and Zora on the other.
Mel asked Eric, “How long have you two been together?”
Eric lifted Meghan’s hand from under the table and kissed it. “Two years. The first time I saw Meghan, I was hooked. I couldn’t take my eyes off her. Then she turned and looked at me and smiled. I couldn’t believe it. Everything came into focus. People say things like the sky is bluer, the birds sing more sweetly, and that is the truth. She was just what I needed in my life,” Eric said and leaned in for a kiss.

PART ONE — HER STYLE
Chapter 1—September 6th, 1972
The night breeze was a welcome sensation after spending six hours working up a sweat cleaning one of the NYU buildings off Washington Square. This seedy side of town always put Melanie on edge. The drenched bandana covering her hair would stay in place until she was safely back in her room. Reaching into her purple bag, she found her keys. Before putting one foot on the sidewalk, she made sure the keys were spread apart and protruding between her fingers.
The walk to the Village Plaza Hotel took as long as smoking one cigarette, three quarters if she was nervous. Three drags in, she heard a low, angry voice. A lighter voice responded as if confused. In the darkness of a doorway off to the left, Melanie could make out a large man hanging over a smaller person.
“Faggot, yer gonna get yer fuckin’ ass kicked,” he growled while raising his massive fist back over his shoulder. It was then that Mel realized the smaller person was a man trying to cover his head with his hands.
Quickly, she stepped toward them. “Honey, where have you been?” she asked, pulling the bandana off her head. The growler, still clenching his fist, turned to look at her. For just a few seconds, he stared at her. Her dirty bell-bottoms and loosely fitting t-shirt covering her slender body did not distract him from the long, curly-cue, strawberry blonde hair that framed her beautiful face and fell to her elbows. With one hand on her hip, she flicked the cigarette to the side. For a fleeting moment, the only sounds were a few crickets communicating with each other. She took that time to smile and step toward him. When she was close enough to see him begin to smile back, her right arm swung around, connecting with his left cheek and eye. The punch itself was not remarkable, but the keys split his face and it had begun to bleed. He lost his balance just enough to allow her to finish the job by kneeing him in the groin. He yelped in pain as he fell over, clutching his crotch. Placing her arm under the light voiced man’s arm, she brought him to his feet.
All he could do was stare at her. Not for her hair and sweet face, but because he was dumbstruck. He’d seen only one other woman fight like that.
Grabbing his hand, they ran down Washington Place. Twice, she looked back to see if the beast was behind them. Tugging him to the right, they ran into the hotel. The man behind the desk in the lobby yelled, “Where are you going?”
“It’s me, Melanie, Mr. Jones.” The three flights of stairs took the last of her energy. Looking back over her shoulder, she felt a little safer. She had not let go of his hand. At times, he’d run right beside her, others ahead of her. They stopped on the third floor. She let go of him and bent over, hands on her knees, trying to catch her breath. With a sweeping motion, she tossed her hair back and stood upright. In front of her darkened doorway, she finally looked over at him. Once her eyes adjusted to the light, she saw his face. In the shadows of a dimly lit bare bulb screwed into the ceiling, she could see his smile. He leaned against the wall with his hand shaking against his chest.
“You’ll be OK,” she tried to say in a calm voice.
His long, dark brown, shiny hair fell in layers just below his shoulders. A pair of Aviator prescription glasses rested on his significant and masculine nose. Eyeliner enhanced his almond-shaped brown eyes and long lashes. Her eyes fell to his mouth, and she couldn’t help but stare at his lips. They were the kind that made women jealous. Both the top and bottom were full. The deep dimples were like perpetual parentheses on the edges of that extraordinary mouth. Once he stood up straight, Melanie guessed he was only a few inches taller than her, putting him at about 5’11”. A bead of blood rolled down over his eyelid.
“Looks like he got a punch in.” She handed him a tissue from her bag, put her blood-covered door key in the worn lock and opened it. He followed her inside.
The kitchen was no more than an area in the otherwise Lilliputian room. She pulled the only chair from the tiny table and motioned for him to sit.
“What’s your name?” she asked as she rinsed off her keys.
“Allen. Shandi.”
She smiled. “Like the beer?”
“No,” he smiled, “as in boisterous.” He looked around the room. It was shabby but clean. Not like anything he’d ever experienced. “And what is your name? I heard you say, ‘Melanie.’”
“Yeah. Melanie. Mel. Foster.”
“As in cultivate?”
“Nah. Like the Grant’s.”
His laugh was light and feminine. Mel pulled a small container from under the twin bed and put it on the threadbare rug next to him. Inside was an assortment of necessities. It contained a sewing needle stuck in a spool of white thread, a hammer, a box of band-aids, a roll of tape, and a small glass container of hydrogen peroxide. She retrieved a band-aid and the bottle.
“Would you take off your glasses, please?”
“Truth be told, my vision is horrible. I can only see about a foot in front of me without them,” he told her.
“I’d like to clean out that cut. That bastard was filthy. It wouldn’t surprise me if you caught something just by breathing in the same space as that creep did. Your glasses could use a wipe, too.” He removed them and tilted his head towards her. “This might sting a bit,” Mel warned. She lifted his thick hair away from his forehead. The aroma of pot and sandalwood floated up to her and it made her smile. She lightly patted his head with a paper towel with the tiniest bit of hydrogen peroxide.
“Jesus!” He winced.
“I’m sorry,” she said, and blew on the cut.
“I haven’t thanked you for saving me from that Neanderthal. What would ever make you go after something that size?”
She paused. “The ‘f’ word.”
“Fuck?”
“Faggot.” The very word made her purse her lips. “May I have your glasses?” She took them, gave them a quick cleaning on her shirt, and held them out to him.
He reached for her hand holding the paper towel, but she quickly pulled away. He was startled by her reaction. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean anything by it,” he said. “I should go. Thank you for your care and time.” He put his glasses back on, then got up and walked to the door.
She was still holding the bloodied paper towel as he closed the door behind him. Her head fell back. “Oh, good Christ,” she said, disappointed in herself. “Let it go!” she whispered.
Once she’d quickly washed the dirty coffee cup from that morning and rinsed herself off in front of the sink, she fell onto the bed. The sounds of New York City outside her window had finally become familiar to her. That was not what kept her from relaxing. The image of his face kept returning to her. Allen was beautiful. He’s gay. She punched her pillow in hopes of making it more comfortable and closed her eyes. Tomorrow is Saturday. She began a mental list of things to do. Things like laundry and groceries and such needed to be done. But then, she heard his laugh in her head. Her eyes opened, and she sighed. There will not be much in the way of sleep tonight. “Happy birthday to me,” she whispered.
Chapter 2
It was nearly noon when she opened her eyes. A light knock on the door startled her. She jumped out of bed and put on her robe.
“Who’s there?”
“I have a delivery for Miss Grant,” a deep voice said.
“Miss Grant?” she whispered, and then it clicked. “Hold on.” Grabbing her bag off the floor, she searched inside until she found a quarter at the bottom. Pulling the door open just a crack, she could see an enormous assortment of purple and white flowers. She opened it wide enough to take them. Slowly, the bouquet lowered, and Allen’s eyes came into view. He playfully batted them at her.
She laughed. “What’s this?”
“It’s just a modest gift in appreciation of your bravery. Also…” He handed her a large, beautifully wrapped box. She took it from him.
“Come on in, please. You didn’t have to do this.”
He placed the flowers on the tiny table, then turned to her. After adjusting his glasses against his nose, Allen stood with his hands behind his back. His skin-tight, shiny black jeans flared out into a modest bell. The shoes looked like women’s leather square-toed chunky-heeled pumps, but he made them look great. The tan tank top was sheer enough that the hair on his chest and the outline of his nipples were evident. Around his neck he wore a slender black leather tie that was loosened and hung low on his chest. The knot itself was strange. A black silk scarf was wrapped several times around his left wrist and tied, leaving the ends hanging about six inches.
She sat on the bed, pulled off the wrapping, and lifted the lid. Inside was a proper first aid kit, a sewing kit complete with scissors, and a few smaller tools complete with two kinds of screwdrivers, a tape measure, pliers and an adjustable wrench.
“This is too much!”
He sat near her and took out an ‘L’ shaped piece of metal and examined it. “What is this?”
“It’s an Allen wrench,” she laughed. His smile disappeared, and he placed it back in the box. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to….” Tentatively, she patted his shoulder and rose from the bed. “Would you like a cup of coffee? All I have is instant.” She clutched her robe at the neck and started to open one of the two cabinets.
“I was hoping I could take you out for a bite. It’s a lovely day. We could walk a bit if you’d like.” Mel did not answer. “We could take a cab if you prefer.”
“I…I don’t have any clean clothes. Today is laundry day for me. Can I take a raincheck?” she finally asked, not meeting his eye as her face reddened.
“Well, this is all too perfect! How long will it take for you to put on whatever you would have worn to the laundromat? In 15 minutes, I’ll have a cab out front, alright?”
“I don’t…”
“Please?” He held out his hand. She looked down, smiled and swatted her fingertips with his.
“Alright, then. Meet me outside in fifteen minutes,” Allen said with a smile. Just before he closed the door, he looked back at her, flashed that incredible smile again, and gave a quick nod in a way that somehow relaxed any of her suspicious feelings.
She lifted a pair of hip huggers from the top of a pile of clothes in her closet and shook them out. Her only clean shirt was a lilac sleeveless turtleneck her brother made for her. She brushed her teeth with one hand and ran her fingers through her thick hair with the other. Laying out two pieces of bread on the counter, she assembled a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. She rinsed out the paper coffee cup she’d saved from the day before and filled it with milk. The lid still fit. There were far too many beautiful flowers in her bouquet not to share. She chose three cosmoses, cut the stems, and set them in a little water-filled jelly jar. Splashing water on her face, she looked at her reflection in the aged mirror on the wall. As ready as I’ll ever be. Taking a deep breath, Melanie slung her bag over her shoulder. She tried to walk calmly down the three flights of stairs.
Through the dirty front door window, she could see Allen leaning on a cab, chatting with the driver. Just then, a tall blonde man walked by them. Both heads swiveled, taking a long look at his ass. She had to chuckle.
“I’d check that out myself,” she whispered.
The day was quite a bit cooler than the day before. Allen took a cigarette from his pocket, along with a gold lighter. As he lit up, he saw Melanie walking toward him. She turned to the homeless man sitting up against the building. “Fred, here’s a little something to eat. Would you save me the glass?” He reached out for the paper bag and cup. With his free hand, he took hers and kissed it. Mumbling something unintelligible to her, she smiled and gave him the flowers.
He placed them up against his leg, cupped his hand around the glass and admired his gift.
A breeze drifted down the street. Melanie’s nipples shriveled from the cold air. Her knee-jerk reaction was to draw her arms up to her chest. Allen noticed and immediately felt embarrassed for her.
A policeman walked by them and stopped to observe Allen. He grabbed Mel’s hand, opened the door to the cab, and helped her in. Walking to the other side, Allen kept an eye on him. He tipped an imaginary cap to the officer and climbed inside. “Broome and Mercer,” he directed and turned to her. “You are adorable!” he said, smiling at Mel. The cabbie stared at him through the rearview mirror.
“Where were you coming from last night?” he asked her.
“My job. I didn’t ask you how your head is.”
He smiled. “It’s fine. Where do you work?”
“In the evenings, I clean some of the buildings at NYU.” She lifted his hair away from the cut. Clicking her tongue at the sight of the half dollar sized bruise developing, she asked, “Did you ice this?”
“No. How old are you?”
“20. And you?”
“24. Where are you from originally?”
“Upstate New York. A tiny town no one’s ever heard of.”
“Is that where you learned to fight?” he asked with a smile.
The color seemed to drain from her face. A silence hung between them until the cab hit a pothole that sent them both leaning hard to the right. She caught Allen as he fell against her.
Her loud, nervous laugh made its debut, and it certainly could draw attention.
“Oh my! Well, I love that sound!” he said.
The cab pulled over and made a hard stop. “Broome and Mercer, Mr. Shandi.” Allen’s tight pants forced him to lean to the left awkwardly. Jamming his right hand in his front pocket, he retrieved a bundle of bills. Mel glanced down at his hands. The bulge to the left of the bottom of his zipper caught her off guard. She very quickly looked away. He gave the cabbie a $5 tip.
“Thank you, Mr. Shandi!” His hand began to tremble as he put his money away. She took notice, and he caught that. He exited, went to her side of the cab and opened the door. Offering her his left hand, he helped her climb out.
“Are you hungry? I’m hungry. Let’s get lunch. My treat,” he said, looking across the street. He grabbed her hand and they sprinted through the traffic. Horns began honking, and a few cars stopped short. He held his hand up in a thanks gesture. She loved the way his hair bounced as he trotted. They entered a narrow eatery. A decidedly gay man welcomed Allen.
“Mr. Shandi, it’s so good to see you again. Your table is ready.” Other couples that had been waiting were not regulars or did not carry the same weight as Allen. She did not know what to make of this.
They were seated across from one another in a dark and quiet corner. Paper menus were brought to the table by a pretty young lady. “What can I get you to drink, Mr. Shandi?” she asked in a coquettish manner. She reached past Melanie’s face to light the candle and replaced the dirty ashtray with a clean one.
“What would you like, Mel?”
No one had called her that in at least five years.
“Coffee please, with milk?” she asked, looking at the waitress.
“I’ll have the same.”
The waitress placed her hand on his shoulder and said, “You’ve got it, Honey.” She walked away with quite a sway in her hips. Mel grinned and looked over to see Allen reaching for her over the table. He took a lock of her curly hair and rolled it between his fingers.
“If mermaids were real, this is the kind of hair they would have.”
She laughed as her face turned red. “Wow. I’ve never heard that before.” The art that was curiously placed up against the wall caught her eye. One piece in particular stood out. “Take a peek at that one! It’s a kaleidoscope!” She turned her attention back to his face. He’d been staring at her. Feeling embarrassed, she pretended to go over the menu. “Where are you from?” Mel asked.
“I’m not an interesting person,” he said while lighting a cigarette. “Would you like one?” he offered.
“No, thanks. I don’t want to hear your deepest, darkest secrets. How about, what do you do for a living? I feel like I’m the only one not in on it. Everybody knows you. I’ve lived here for five months, and I have no idea what you do or why you are so,” she paused, “beloved.”
“Beloved. That’s interesting.” He propped up his elbow on the table, and he rested his chin in his hand. The smoke from his cigarette curled up around his face. She sat back in the chair and crossed her ankle over her knee. Lacing her fingers together, she rested her hands in her lap. Giving him an “I’ve got all day” look, she took a deep breath.
Tapping his cigarette on the ashtray, he asked, “Have you ever heard of a clothing line called ‘Cleo’?”
“Yes. Do you work for her?”
“Well, I am her, so to speak. I named it after a knot I created for a necktie.” He pointed to the one that hung from his neck. It almost appeared to be a braid, and yet it was not. “The business has been open for three and a half years. It was perfect timing for my vision of what young women wanted. And the rest as they say…” he laughed, waving his cigarette in the air.
The waitress returned with the coffee. “Have you decided what you’d like to eat?” she asked, staring directly at Allen.
“Not really. Can we have a few more minutes?”
“Sure, Honey,” she answered and sashayed away, stopping once to look over her shoulder at Allen. But his thoughts were elsewhere.
“Have you always known you were…a visionary?” Mel asked as she stirred her coffee.
Allen glanced around to see if anyone was within earshot. He whispered, “What exactly are you asking?”
“My brother made this top for me. Not really my style, but he made it with love.” She gently touched the gauzy fabric around her neck. “Ben knew he was gay from the time he was a little boy,” Mel said softly. Her eyes welled up. “My mother simply ignored that fact. My father had an altogether different take on Ben. The things he would punish him for, well, it would just break your heart. That bastard took off in 1965. Good riddance.”
“Where is Ben now?”
“Buried in the Oswegatchie Cemetery outside of Fine, NY. Fine, NY! Funny, huh?” she laughed to cover the sadness.
More customers had begun to fill the place. The waitress returned once more. “What will it be?” she asked.
“Mel?” he asked.
She kept her head down and asked, “May I have a burger?” A tear rolled down her nose and fell on the menu.
“I’ll have the same,” he said. The waitress jotted it down as she walked away.
He gave Mel his napkin. “Dry your eyes, Sweetness,” then moved to a chair next to her and put his arm around her shoulders. “There are souls that are just too beautiful for this world,” he whispered in her ear. She had thought the very same thing a thousand times.
Two gay teens cautiously approached the table. Mel looked up. “Your fans, Mr. S! If you’ll excuse me…” The young men nearly levitated over a chance to chat with Allen. He watched her walk through a narrow doorway and into the restroom.
Splashing a little water on her face, she looked at her reflection. Her hands gripped the sides of the sink. “Pull it together,” she whispered to herself. Once she’d collected herself with a few deep breaths, she headed back to the table. She stopped and watched Allen as he spoke to them. He listened carefully as they replied and talked about their dreams.
Allen was leaning forward, elbows on his knees and speaking softly. He was incredibly patient as he explained what it took to get where he was. His enormous smile was evidence that he seemed to enjoy this part of his celebrity.
She leaned against the door frame, legs crossed at the ankles, her arms crossed just below her chest.
The two teens stood close to each other. For a second, their pinkies hooked together. Allen grinned. Removing the scarf from his wrist, he tied it around the wrist of the young man on the left, then lifted the tie from his neck and put it on the other fan. He held out his hand to shake theirs.
An older couple seated at a nearby table shook their heads in disapproval. Mel stood and stared at them for a moment, then turned her back and obstructed their view. The boys practically pogoed over to her.
“Johnny, isn’t he amazing?” the shorter of the two asked his boyfriend.
He grinned at Mel and said, “He’s amazing!”
“He certainly is,” she replied. The boys left overwhelmed with joy about what had just happened.
The burgers arrived at the table as Mel sat back down. “Thank you,” she said to the waitress and tried to make eye contact.
Finally, she looked at Mel and said, “You’re welcome.”
“Those kids will be living on that for a long time. That’s just about the sweetest thing I have ever seen,” she told him.
“I could say that about what you did for the guy sitting in front of your building earlier, but I won’t. Mine was sweeter.”
Her laugh reached the customers near the front door. “Sorry,” she said, covering her mouth, trying to muffle the sound. “You are a brat!”
“The boys’ names are Jon and Johnny. Isn’t that sweet? They’re hoping to open a clothing store in the village.” As he set his coffee cup on the saucer, his hand trembled again, rattling both. “Don’t ever apologize for your laugh. I like people that let their emotions out. I’d hate to think what would happen if you tried to hold that inside. It could be catastrophic! Your eyes and brain would be scattered everywhere!” he nearly shrilled, while his hand swiped through the air as if he were carrying a tray of filled coffee cups.
She was about to ask him about his hand, but he stood, excused himself, and headed toward the restroom. His hand, his life. It was quite simply none of her business.
When he returned, they continued to talk for another hour or so. Allen had participated in the Stonewall riots and Mel wanted to learn about every scrap of it.
“I witnessed the woman, Storme DeLarverie, fighting the cops. Some aren’t sure it was her, but I’m convinced it was. When she yelled out to us, ‘Why don’t you guys do something?’ we all went crazy. I guess we all have a boiling point.”
“Truer words, my friend. Ben wanted so much to be a part of it. He never hid who he was. All he ever wanted was to work for, well, someone exactly like you. Damn, you would have loved him,” she said, leaning back in her chair.
“The mob and the cops were involved in the whole thing. Talk about an uphill battle. At that time, the lesbians, queens and gays were not exactly a team.”
“Really? You’d think people treating all of you like dirt would be enough to pull everyone together,” she said.
“Well, to be fair, I’ve seen the same sort of division in the women’s movement.”
“You’re right.” She paused and said, “Things are going to change. They’ve got to. We have no control over who we fall in love with.” She lit one of the two cigarettes she had left. “Would you like one?” she offered. He waved it off. “Do you have somebody special in your life?” she asked.
“Yes, I do. A man named Christopher.” Allen’s eyes lit up.
“How did you meet?”
“Everyone thinks we met at a fashion show. We met while waiting for a cab. Long story short, we ended up sharing one and kept on sharing.”
“How long are the two of you together?”
“Almost a year,” he answered with a smile.
“How did you know it was love?”
“Oh, good Lord. How does anyone ever truly know? I wish I could say that it was love at first sight. Like a bolt of lightning jabbing me in the heart and I would never be the same. I think that’s bull. It never happens that way. How about you? Is there someone special?”
“No,” she said, stood and tossed her bag over her shoulder. She sighed as she thought about the bill. “I don’t even have enough money for a decent tip. I promise I will pay you back.” As she passed the kaleidoscope painting, she stopped to take a closer look but gasped when she saw the price.
He stood and tossed a few bills on the table. As he passed the waitress, he shoved a few additional bills into her pocket. “Thank you, dear.” She smiled at him, then continued to pour coffee into another young man’s cup, flirting away with her latest customer.
It felt good to have something substantial in her stomach for a change. As they left the eatery and headed north, a sophisticated man walked toward them. His Dobermann ignored the noises around him. “Geeze. Check out this beautiful beast,” she gushed. “Excuse me. May I pet him?” she asked the gentleman.
“He can be skittish,” he replied.
Mel held her hand out palm down. She let the dog take its time sniffing, and then she turned her hand over. He began to lick her fingers.
“Well, I’ll be,” said the man.
“My trick is to let them smell me when I just finished eating,” she joked. The gentleman chuckled as he and his pet went on with their walk.
“You like dogs?” Allen asked.
“To be honest, I love them. Dogs are such wonderful creatures. They love you no matter what. That’s hard to find.”
“Let me get a cab.” There were none in sight. While they waited at the curb, a policeman began to cross the street and headed toward them. Allen shoved his hand into his pockets and quietly asked, “Would you take my arm?”
Mel did not realize what was happening but did what he had asked. It was then that she noticed the officer. Mel laid her head on his shoulder and focused her gaze on a couple window shopping across the street. Once he had passed, she removed her arm from his. “I hate that fucking shit,” she hissed. Allen looked down at her face. Her eyes were blazing. He waved down an approaching cab, and they piled in.
“You can’t let it get to you,” he said in a matter-of fact kind of way. He turned his attention to the cabbie and said, “West Central Park and 69th.” This time, she accepted when he offered a cigarette.
Pulling her hair back, she leaned into the lighter’s flame. She sighed. “I’m not able to pay for anything, and it’s driving me nuts. I’m embarrassed,” and sighed again. “As soon as I…”
“Later, OK?” he asked and patted her hand.
She could not help but look up at all the high-reaching buildings that stood in Manhattan. “I can never get over just how immense this place is.” Her head was just about upside down, trying to get the best possible view.
“Yes. You are adorable.” She didn’t hear him. The city and all its energy had her full attention. Allen turned to the gorgeous driver. When they arrived at his address, the cabbie thanked Allen for the tip. He also handed him a slip of paper with his name and number on it.
Allen just smiled and put it in his pocket.
A uniformed doorman held open the heavy glass door. “Good afternoon, Mr. Shandi.”
“Hey there, George. How are Christina and the baby?”
“They are wonderful, thanks for asking.”
“Come on. You must have a picture, yes?”
With that, George pulled his wallet out of his pocket and opened it to a photo.
“Oh,” Allen said with a sigh. “Oh my gosh. They are lovely. Is Penelope about four months old now? Look at these beautiful women, Mel.”
She took the wallet. The woman in the photo looked thrilled to be a mom. Little Penelope’s toothless grin was precious. “You are a very lucky man,” she said placing her hand on her abdomen. Still smiling, she handed it back to him.
“Yes, I am.” George took a few seconds to look at the picture before putting it away.
“By the way, Christopher has taken Daphne for a walk.”
Allen gave him a wink. “Thanks, George.”
The elevator required a unique key to go to the penthouse. Mel and Allen rode it nine floors up. When the elevator doors opened, they stepped into a small area with a large door across the way. He opened it and they entered an extravagant vestibule. Mel had never seen or could even imagine such wealth. An older gentleman greeted Allen with his mail and messages.
He looked inquisitively at Melanie.
Allen said, “This is my sweet friend, Melanie. Mel, this is Quinten. If you need or want anything, this is your man.”
Mel extended her hand out to Quinten and said, “Nice to meet you.” He hesitated and looked at Allen. Allen grinned.
He took her hand and said, “It’s very nice to meet you. Would you prefer Mel or Melanie?”
“Either is fine. May I use the bathroom?”
“Of course, follow me, please.”
The bathroom was straight ahead and to the right. It was below a winding staircase with full bookshelves. Quinten lightly pressed the spine of a red and black book, and a door opened outward. Orange-yellow light spilled out onto the tiled floor.
“I’ve never actually seen a secret door. Very cool! Thank you,” she said and went inside. The dominant color was red, and the accent colors were black, gold and purple. Tiles of red with gold swirls outlined in black covered the bottom half of the walls. The upper half was crimson. She was sure the entire room was larger than her apartment. There were several black and red velvet ottomans and a purple and gold chaise lounge in a sitting area. On the other side of a half wall was the toilet and a bidet alongside it. Over the double sinks hung an enormous mirror with an ornate frame. She set her bag on the black marble counter between the sinks. As she sat on the toilet, she tried to take all of it in. “And this is just the bathroom,” she whispered. Once she’d finished, she washed her hands and raked her fingers through her hair.
Allen was waiting for her. “I’d like to show you something.” They went up the stairs and off to the left. After passing several rooms, Allen held open the door to a bedroom. She flashed him a confused expression.
“Oh! No. This isn’t one of those ‘I’d like to show you my etchings’ snares. I wanted to show you a few things from my collection. It’s through the doorway on the left.”
She did not budge. “Wait here,” he said and disappeared into that room. As he came back, he draped pieces of clothing on hangers across the bed. Spreading them out, he chose a backless sequin-covered halter top jumpsuit in champagne gold. “Isn’t this scrumptious?”
“It’s dazzling. But it’s not my style.”
He looked at the remainder of what was on the bed. “That’s the second time you’ve mentioned your style. What is your style, exactly?”
“I like a less feminine look, you know? I’ve always been a tomboy,” she said timidly. “Do you design things for men?”
The sound of quickly clicking toenails on the wood floor grew louder. With that, a magnificent Rottweiler burst into the room. “Daphne-love!” gushed Allen.
Catching his breath, Christopher followed. He stood over six feet tall, blonde hair parted on the right and trimmed with precision. Although he was slender, he was muscular the way 20-year-old men often are. “I’m back from our daily tug. She is going to pull my arm out one of these days,” he said.
Daphne’s interest shifted to the new scent in the room. Her full tail swished back and forth as she sniffed Mel’s feet and legs.
“Who is this?” Christopher asked, inspecting Mel.
She stuck out her hand, “I’m Mel Foster.” He hesitated for a moment, then took her hand. “It’s very nice to meet you,” she said. Still looking at Christopher, she asked, “Daphne’s tail is intact? I don’t think I’ve ever seen that. She’s a beauty.”
“We got her when she was a pup, and we specifically told them not to do that. It’s unthinkable,” Allen huffed.
Mel was on her knees, along with Christopher, cuddling and scratching her belly. “We had a large dog when I was little. Just a mutt, but at least 100 pounds. My father found a harness for her and it helped when we had to walk her.” Daphne jumped onto Mel knocking her back with her legs folded under her and began licking her face. Mel laughed and hugged her around the neck.
“Daphne!” Allen laughed. “Come! Come here, my girl.” She obediently went to his side.
“May I have a washcloth or something?” Mel asked once Allen had lured Daphne away.
Christopher answered, “Sure.” Mel followed him out of the bedroom and down the hall.
“Second door on the left,” he said with a forced smile.
She pushed the door, but it did not close all the way. Splashing her face with warm soap and water removed the drool from her face. Two black velvet ottomans placed side by side with a tiny table between were in the corner. She sat and took advantage of the small, crystal ashtray. Digging through her bag, she retrieved her last cigarette, matches and a hair clip. Taking a deep drag, she grabbed everything and went to the mirror. With the cigarette hanging from her mouth, she pulled her thick hair and piled it on the crown of her head. The extra-large leather slide barely fit over her mop of curls. She pushed the stick through the holes to secure everything in place. Invariably, five or six tendrils hung down around her neck, dripping down over her back and shoulders. She could hear a discussion growing louder coming from the bedroom. “She will end up becoming just another fag-hag for you. What is this, the fifth? I do not need yet another person hanging around watching us as if you and I were a freakshow,” Christopher said firmly.
“You are wrong about her. She’s one of us. Her ideas about women’s clothing are perfect for what’s down the road,” said Allen.
“Is that how you met her?” There was a pause.
Trying to make her presence known, Mel tugged the door open and stomped heavily onto the floor. Daphne flounced toward her. “I’m going to have to get going, little girl.” Holding either side of her enormous head, she kissed her loudly.
“Your hair. I love it!” declared Allen. “I have a proposal for you, Mel. You brought up a more masculine feel for women’s clothing. Would you help me bring that idea to life?” Allen asked.
“I don’t know the first thing about fashion.”
Christopher laughed, “You’ve got that right.”
“Now, now. Let’s not be bitchy,” said Allen.
Mel motioned toward Christopher while looking at Allen and said, “He understands that I do not…”
“Sometimes, all you need to know is what you like and what you don’t like,” said Allen. “Like art.” He grabbed her hand and led her to the back of the bedroom. After opening the double-door walk-in closet, he began to look through his clothes. He chose a white button-down shirt from his closet. “What would you do with this?” He held it out to her. His right arm was across his chest and was clutching his left bicep. His forearm extended outward with the palm of his hand facing the ceiling, and the shirt dangled from his fingertip. She would come to know this as his “What say you?” pose.
“Seriously?” She exhaled. Taking the shirt from him, she hung it from an indentation on one of the columns of the four-poster bed. Christopher gasped at the thought of damage done to the tiger maple column. “I would make it sleeveless and shorten the front to waist length.” She turned it around. Christopher stepped in and held it for her. “Thanks, Christopher. It could be darted a bit to fit my form, then lengthened the shirttail to fall just passed the…” she patted her rear.
“Ass?” Christopher asked. Allen gave him a look.
“Well, I was gonna say cheeks, but either fit. Split it up the middle to about two inches below the waistline. It would end up kind of like tails on a tux. If you could give it lapels rather than a collar, I think that would be something I’d like.”
“What would you wear with it?” asked Allen.
Taking a moment to think, she finally said, “I would wear straight leg jeans and man boots up to my knees. You know, the kind that you tie up in the front without the spiky heels.”
Allen looked over at Christopher and said, “Do you see what I mean?”
“Do you design clothes also, Christopher?”
He seemed insulted by the question. “I am a model,” he answered in a sharp tone.
“I’m sorry. I don’t read many magazines.” Pointing out her appearance with gesturing hands, she laughed, “Just look at me for crying out loud!”
“I have to give you that,” Christopher said.
“Honey, that’s not…” Allen started to say.
“But it’s funny and appropriate,” answered Mel. “Allen, thanks for all of this. I’ve got to get going.”
A nearly palpable look went from Allen to Christopher. Christopher shrugged his shoulders and said, “OK,” and he left the room.
“This might be forward, but I…we wondered if you would consider staying with us while we take Cleo in this new direction? This place has several empty rooms. But I think you’d truly love the one on the far end.”
“But I haven’t agreed to the clothing thing.”
He ignored her. She followed him to an enormous room down the hallway. Daphne’s toenails let them know she was right behind them. Everything was covered with sheets except the king-size bed. Sliding glass doors on the far side of the room led to a balcony complete with greenery and furniture. The walls were white, and the furniture was in varying shades of red. As the sun fell low in the sky, it cast a fantastic orangey-pink over everything around her, including Allen.
“Isn’t it gorgeous?”
“Yes, but I have a job,” she said.
He came toward her and held her by the shoulders. “This is an opportunity to grow. It will be your job. Name your price.” She was only aware of his hands on her. Everything else was a blur. “Please?” he asked, batting his eyes again. Allen bent down a bit to meet her eye and was inches from her face. “I need you.”
She paused, then finally said, “Yes. Thank you. Allen, I am so grateful…” but the lump in her throat and tears squelched her ability to speak.
Allen threw his arms around her and she pulled away just a bit. He laughed and said, “I’m sorry. I excite easily!”
“Good to know,” she said, patting him on the back. He laughed into her ear. The sensation of his breath on her neck was incredible and alarming at once. “I have one request.”
“Name it.”
She pulled back and placed her hands on his chest. “I am not a huggee, cuddly, touchy-feely person. Please, don’t take it the wrong way. You are such a great guy, a real gentleman. You would never deliberately hurt anyone. It just makes me uncomfortable.”
He looked into her eyes. “Of course, I can respect that.” He backed away. “I understand, you know. Maybe better than most. I was different, too.” She felt light-headed.
“Are you alright?” he asked.
“Yes. I think I need a shower and a good night’s sleep.”
“Can I have Quinten bring you a bite to eat?”
“No, not right now. If I get hungry, I’ll poke around the kitchen, if that’s OK.”
“It’s fine with me, but Quinten gets a bit touchy when his domain is disturbed.”
“I promise I’ll clean up after myself,” she offered.
“Good Lord, woman, I was joking! Feel free to have anything you’d like.” He left her room and closed the door behind him.
Chapter 3
By the next morning, all of Mel’s belongings had been picked up and delivered to the penthouse. That afternoon, Allen purchased a month’s worth of clothing for her right down to her panties, along with a carton of her favorite cigarettes plus several joints. She sat on the edge of the bed surrounded by all of it, including the jelly jar she’d given to Fred and her prized possession. It was an old lockbox. Taking the key out of her bag, she placed the box on her lap and opened it slowly. Lifting the three photographs of her brother, Benjamin, from inside, she traced his face with her finger. It also contained a spool of fishing line. She looked up to see Allen standing in the doorway. She closed the box and set it aside.
“Would you like a hand putting things away?” he asked.
“I can’t accept all of this.”
“Consider it an advance,” he said. “Anything you dislike will be returned, exchanged, whatever.” He walked toward her.
Mel stood and moved toward the middle of the room. “You could have let my friend keep the glass,” she remarked.
“I did something a little better, I think. I hope you agree. Fred now occupies your old apartment, and I’ve paid up for two years. He has several new outfits, a bit of cash, and will be filling in at your old job until you decide what you want to do. I will find another place for you to live if you think this isn’t working out, but I want you to share your ideas with me,” he said in a serious tone.
She turned away from him. “I’m going to do my very best for you. Thank you for giving me this chance.”
He moved toward her, then thought better of it. Quinten knocked on the door frame.
“Excuse me, Sir. How many for dinner tonight?”
“Six, I think. Very casual, OK?” Allen asked.
“Time?”
“Six-thirty.”
“Is there anything, in particular, you would like tonight, Sir?”
“Mel, if you sat down in a restaurant and could have anything you wanted, what would it be?” Allen asked her.
She chuckled. “I feel as if I’m in a dream, or I’m high. Maybe I’ve died and gone to Heaven.” She asked timidly, “Do you like spaghetti and meatballs and maybe a salad?”
“Perfect. Is that doable, Quinten?”
“Of course, Sir. Can I get you anything in the meantime, Miss Melanie?”
“No thanks, and for God’s sake, drop the Miss. You make me feel as if I’m the character in ‘Gone with the Wind’! Or worse, my mother.”
“Quinten, could you give us a minute?”
“Of course,” he said and went downstairs.
Allen sat on the bench at the foot of the bed. His legs crossed at the knee and leaning back on his hands. “Did I tell you how I ended up living here?” he asked Mel. She shook her head, no. He gestured with his hand for her to sit next to him. She sat beside him with her legs apart, her elbows resting on her thighs and hands folded. He brushed her hair over her shoulder.
“I just want to see your face, OK?”
“Yes,” she answered and looked at him.
“My father owned an oil conglomerate. It doesn’t matter which one. They are all greed-factories. He could buy and sell God, or so he said. The best part is that God got the last laugh. One morning he told his secretary that there were to be no phone calls, no interruptions. He had a massive heart attack at his desk while she typed away just outside his door. Side note, she was also his mistress. An hour and a half later, she poked her head in to ask a question. She found him sweat-soaked and face down in a pool of his vomit. The Man upstairs is a funny guy, don’t you agree?”
“I gather you were not close to him?”
“No one was. My father loved money and fucking women. If he could have figured out a way to bang them with a roll of hundreds on his cock, it would have been his ejaculation of a lifetime.”
“Wow,” she chuckled. “How did your mom take it?”
“Poor thing, she loved him and not for his money. She would tell me about the 19-year-old boy she’d met all those years ago. Generous, kind, hardworking and very gentle with her. Somewhere along the line, he soured. He began drinking to excess and worse, hitting her. He became ruthless.”
“Did he know you are gay?”
“I think if he’d spent just a bit of time with me, he would have. But you must be in the same room with a person, look into their eyes, listen to what they say to learn anything. My wonderful mother died two years after my father. Countless homes, cars, all kinds of ‘things’ had become the property of my brother and me. Did I tell you I have a brother? Keith. Funny guy. A good man. Anyway. He and I sold most of it and gave the money to charities for the homeless, hospitals, but the best was handing out money to anyone that looked like they could use it. We knew this would make the old bastard roll in his grave. Even better, we made the donations in his name.”
“Ooooh, you scoundrels. I love it,” she laughed.
“Quinten has been with our family since before I was born. He is an old-fashioned gentleman’s gentleman. He just can’t help himself. I know for certain there were times that he would intercept when that bastard was after my mom. He’d lie and say there was a phone call or news on TV about my father’s company. My father was so drunk he probably could have distracted him with a ring of keys, …like an infant. All that being said, Quinten is who he is, and we accept him that way. Alright?”
Her face was beet red. “Yes. Understood. I’ll make it right.” She looked back on the bed and asked, “I hate to sound like such a girl, but what are you wearing tonight?”
Allen laughed. “How do jeans and a shirt sound? Shoes are optional.”
“Comfortable, thank you.”
Allen’s chef, Wyatt Edmonds, had taken the time to ask Mel about her selection for dinner, right down to the amount of garlic or basil. He stood at six foot four and two hundred forty pounds of muscle. He looked extremely intimidating, but that turned out to be completely wrong. He was a gentle and soft-spoken man. It was moving to see his interest in what would make her happy.
That evening, softly playing jazz hung in the background. Allen and Christopher were in one of two black loveseats in a cozy area of the living room. The other loveseat was directly across from them, with two red high-back chairs between them facing the fireplace. A black lacquered coffee table sat between it all.
The first to arrive were two women that worked in the garment district. Eric had red cropped hair and was wearing a man’s blue button-down shirt tucked into her black jeans with a matching blue belt and sneakers.
Mel asked Eric, “May I ask, do you consider yourself a ‘he’ or ‘she’?”
“He, and thank you for asking.” His girlfriend, Meghan also had red hair, but shoulder length. She wore a short denim skirt, a red sweater and black high heels. After the introductions, Allen offered drinks. Eric would have his usual Pabst Blue Ribbon beer in a pint glass while Meghan preferred white wine. Rather than help, Christopher called out for a vodka and tonic. As Allen gave Eric and Meghan their drinks, he heard the elevator door open and excused himself. Mel went to the bar to make Christopher’s drink. She brought it to him and asked, “What do you think Allen will have?”
“I have no idea,” he answered, not meeting her eyes.
“Mel, meet Zora Preston. She is a buyer for one of the high-end stores on 5th Avenue. Zora, Mel Foster.”
She was a tall, curvy African American woman with a beautiful, giant Afro. She wore a tight-fitting, sleeveless black turtleneck sweater, large gold hoop earrings and a floor-length striped skirt in all the colors of the rainbow. Mel smiled and shook her hand. “Do you prefer Mel or Melanie?” Zora asked in a soft and sexy voice.
“Either is fine.”
“Then, Melanie, it is.”
“Your hair is gorgeous!” Mel gushed.
“As is yours,” she responded, taking a handful and twirling it between her fingers.
“I told her just how beautiful you are, Mel. And did I lie?” Allen asked, holding his hands to her like the statuesque women on game shows would when displaying a new car.
Mel became an entirely new shade of red. “Allen, please.” She laughed and turned to Zora. “If you know Allen at all, then you know how generous he is with his compliments. Zora, what can I get you to drink?”
“I’ll have whatever you’re having,” she smiled, putting her hand on top of Mel’s. The sound of ice cubes clinking together came from Christopher. He’d raised his glass and shook it. Allen snatched it from his hand, then he and Mel went to the bar.
“What’s going on, Allen?”
“I’m sorry for Christopher’s behavior.”
“That’s not what I meant. Why is Zora here?”
“I thought the two of you might hit it off,” he said innocently.
“Oh, good Christ,” she said, leaning on the marble surface. She closed her eyes and said, “Are you under the impression that I am a lesbian?”
“Well, yes.”
“Oh, my God,” she whispered, then laughed. “I can’t be upset with you. A tomboy is a stone’s throw from that. No, I’m not a lesbian. This beautiful woman was brought here as my date?”
“I am so sorry,” he said, thoroughly embarrassed. “Let me talk to Zora.”
“No. That’s OK. Let me,” Mel said. After handing Christopher his drink, she asked, “Zora, would you mind checking out the wine selections?”
“Not at all.”
Allen watched out of the corner of his eye as Mel placed her hand on Zora’s back. Mel smiled at her and spoke softly. A look of confusion came across Zora’s face as Mel spoke but quickly changed to a warm smile. Zora placed her hand on Mel’s. She kissed her on the forehead and, with her thumb, wiped the lipstick it left behind. Their attention turned to the wine. Mel laughed loudly at something Zora said. Christopher smirked at Mel. “Idiot,” he said under his breath. Allen shot him a look.
The evening continued as if nothing had happened. The dining room table was set, complete with two flower arrangements. Allen and Christopher sat at opposite ends of the table. Eric and Meghan sat on one side and Mel and Zora on the other.
Mel asked Eric, “How long have you two been together?”
Eric lifted Meghan’s hand from under the table and kissed it. “Two years. The first time I saw Meghan, I was hooked. I couldn’t take my eyes off her. Then she turned and looked at me and smiled. I couldn’t believe it. Everything came into focus. People say things like the sky is bluer, the birds sing more sweetly, and that is the truth. She was just what I needed in my life,” Eric said and leaned in for a kiss.

PART ONE — HER STYLE
Chapter 1—September 6th, 1972
The night breeze was a welcome sensation after spending six hours working up a sweat cleaning one of the NYU buildings off Washington Square. This seedy side of town always put Melanie on edge. The drenched bandana covering her hair would stay in place until she was safely back in her room. Reaching into her purple bag, she found her keys. Before putting one foot on the sidewalk, she made sure the keys were spread apart and protruding between her fingers.
The walk to the Village Plaza Hotel took as long as smoking one cigarette, three quarters if she was nervous. Three drags in, she heard a low, angry voice. A lighter voice responded as if confused. In the darkness of a doorway off to the left, Melanie could make out a large man hanging over a smaller person.
“Faggot, yer gonna get yer fuckin’ ass kicked,” he growled while raising his massive fist back over his shoulder. It was then that Mel realized the smaller person was a man trying to cover his head with his hands.
Quickly, she stepped toward them. “Honey, where have you been?” she asked, pulling the bandana off her head. The growler, still clenching his fist, turned to look at her. For just a few seconds, he stared at her. Her dirty bell-bottoms and loosely fitting t-shirt covering her slender body did not distract him from the long, curly-cue, strawberry blonde hair that framed her beautiful face and fell to her elbows. With one hand on her hip, she flicked the cigarette to the side. For a fleeting moment, the only sounds were a few crickets communicating with each other. She took that time to smile and step toward him. When she was close enough to see him begin to smile back, her right arm swung around, connecting with his left cheek and eye. The punch itself was not remarkable, but the keys split his face and it had begun to bleed. He lost his balance just enough to allow her to finish the job by kneeing him in the groin. He yelped in pain as he fell over, clutching his crotch. Placing her arm under the light voiced man’s arm, she brought him to his feet.
All he could do was stare at her. Not for her hair and sweet face, but because he was dumbstruck. He’d seen only one other woman fight like that.
Grabbing his hand, they ran down Washington Place. Twice, she looked back to see if the beast was behind them. Tugging him to the right, they ran into the hotel. The man behind the desk in the lobby yelled, “Where are you going?”
“It’s me, Melanie, Mr. Jones.” The three flights of stairs took the last of her energy. Looking back over her shoulder, she felt a little safer. She had not let go of his hand. At times, he’d run right beside her, others ahead of her. They stopped on the third floor. She let go of him and bent over, hands on her knees, trying to catch her breath. With a sweeping motion, she tossed her hair back and stood upright. In front of her darkened doorway, she finally looked over at him. Once her eyes adjusted to the light, she saw his face. In the shadows of a dimly lit bare bulb screwed into the ceiling, she could see his smile. He leaned against the wall with his hand shaking against his chest.
“You’ll be OK,” she tried to say in a calm voice.
His long, dark brown, shiny hair fell in layers just below his shoulders. A pair of Aviator prescription glasses rested on his significant and masculine nose. Eyeliner enhanced his almond-shaped brown eyes and long lashes. Her eyes fell to his mouth, and she couldn’t help but stare at his lips. They were the kind that made women jealous. Both the top and bottom were full. The deep dimples were like perpetual parentheses on the edges of that extraordinary mouth. Once he stood up straight, Melanie guessed he was only a few inches taller than her, putting him at about 5’11”. A bead of blood rolled down over his eyelid.
“Looks like he got a punch in.” She handed him a tissue from her bag, put her blood-covered door key in the worn lock and opened it. He followed her inside.
The kitchen was no more than an area in the otherwise Lilliputian room. She pulled the only chair from the tiny table and motioned for him to sit.
“What’s your name?” she asked as she rinsed off her keys.
“Allen. Shandi.”
She smiled. “Like the beer?”
“No,” he smiled, “as in boisterous.” He looked around the room. It was shabby but clean. Not like anything he’d ever experienced. “And what is your name? I heard you say, ‘Melanie.’”
“Yeah. Melanie. Mel. Foster.”
“As in cultivate?”
“Nah. Like the Grant’s.”
His laugh was light and feminine. Mel pulled a small container from under the twin bed and put it on the threadbare rug next to him. Inside was an assortment of necessities. It contained a sewing needle stuck in a spool of white thread, a hammer, a box of band-aids, a roll of tape, and a small glass container of hydrogen peroxide. She retrieved a band-aid and the bottle.
“Would you take off your glasses, please?”
“Truth be told, my vision is horrible. I can only see about a foot in front of me without them,” he told her.
“I’d like to clean out that cut. That bastard was filthy. It wouldn’t surprise me if you caught something just by breathing in the same space as that creep did. Your glasses could use a wipe, too.” He removed them and tilted his head towards her. “This might sting a bit,” Mel warned. She lifted his thick hair away from his forehead. The aroma of pot and sandalwood floated up to her and it made her smile. She lightly patted his head with a paper towel with the tiniest bit of hydrogen peroxide.
“Jesus!” He winced.
“I’m sorry,” she said, and blew on the cut.
“I haven’t thanked you for saving me from that Neanderthal. What would ever make you go after something that size?”
She paused. “The ‘f’ word.”
“Fuck?”
“Faggot.” The very word made her purse her lips. “May I have your glasses?” She took them, gave them a quick cleaning on her shirt, and held them out to him.
He reached for her hand holding the paper towel, but she quickly pulled away. He was startled by her reaction. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean anything by it,” he said. “I should go. Thank you for your care and time.” He put his glasses back on, then got up and walked to the door.
She was still holding the bloodied paper towel as he closed the door behind him. Her head fell back. “Oh, good Christ,” she said, disappointed in herself. “Let it go!” she whispered.
Once she’d quickly washed the dirty coffee cup from that morning and rinsed herself off in front of the sink, she fell onto the bed. The sounds of New York City outside her window had finally become familiar to her. That was not what kept her from relaxing. The image of his face kept returning to her. Allen was beautiful. He’s gay. She punched her pillow in hopes of making it more comfortable and closed her eyes. Tomorrow is Saturday. She began a mental list of things to do. Things like laundry and groceries and such needed to be done. But then, she heard his laugh in her head. Her eyes opened, and she sighed. There will not be much in the way of sleep tonight. “Happy birthday to me,” she whispered.
Chapter 2
It was nearly noon when she opened her eyes. A light knock on the door startled her. She jumped out of bed and put on her robe.
“Who’s there?”
“I have a delivery for Miss Grant,” a deep voice said.
“Miss Grant?” she whispered, and then it clicked. “Hold on.” Grabbing her bag off the floor, she searched inside until she found a quarter at the bottom. Pulling the door open just a crack, she could see an enormous assortment of purple and white flowers. She opened it wide enough to take them. Slowly, the bouquet lowered, and Allen’s eyes came into view. He playfully batted them at her.
She laughed. “What’s this?”
“It’s just a modest gift in appreciation of your bravery. Also…” He handed her a large, beautifully wrapped box. She took it from him.
“Come on in, please. You didn’t have to do this.”
He placed the flowers on the tiny table, then turned to her. After adjusting his glasses against his nose, Allen stood with his hands behind his back. His skin-tight, shiny black jeans flared out into a modest bell. The shoes looked like women’s leather square-toed chunky-heeled pumps, but he made them look great. The tan tank top was sheer enough that the hair on his chest and the outline of his nipples were evident. Around his neck he wore a slender black leather tie that was loosened and hung low on his chest. The knot itself was strange. A black silk scarf was wrapped several times around his left wrist and tied, leaving the ends hanging about six inches.
She sat on the bed, pulled off the wrapping, and lifted the lid. Inside was a proper first aid kit, a sewing kit complete with scissors, and a few smaller tools complete with two kinds of screwdrivers, a tape measure, pliers and an adjustable wrench.
“This is too much!”
He sat near her and took out an ‘L’ shaped piece of metal and examined it. “What is this?”
“It’s an Allen wrench,” she laughed. His smile disappeared, and he placed it back in the box. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to….” Tentatively, she patted his shoulder and rose from the bed. “Would you like a cup of coffee? All I have is instant.” She clutched her robe at the neck and started to open one of the two cabinets.
“I was hoping I could take you out for a bite. It’s a lovely day. We could walk a bit if you’d like.” Mel did not answer. “We could take a cab if you prefer.”
“I…I don’t have any clean clothes. Today is laundry day for me. Can I take a raincheck?” she finally asked, not meeting his eye as her face reddened.
“Well, this is all too perfect! How long will it take for you to put on whatever you would have worn to the laundromat? In 15 minutes, I’ll have a cab out front, alright?”
“I don’t…”
“Please?” He held out his hand. She looked down, smiled and swatted her fingertips with his.
“Alright, then. Meet me outside in fifteen minutes,” Allen said with a smile. Just before he closed the door, he looked back at her, flashed that incredible smile again, and gave a quick nod in a way that somehow relaxed any of her suspicious feelings.
She lifted a pair of hip huggers from the top of a pile of clothes in her closet and shook them out. Her only clean shirt was a lilac sleeveless turtleneck her brother made for her. She brushed her teeth with one hand and ran her fingers through her thick hair with the other. Laying out two pieces of bread on the counter, she assembled a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. She rinsed out the paper coffee cup she’d saved from the day before and filled it with milk. The lid still fit. There were far too many beautiful flowers in her bouquet not to share. She chose three cosmoses, cut the stems, and set them in a little water-filled jelly jar. Splashing water on her face, she looked at her reflection in the aged mirror on the wall. As ready as I’ll ever be. Taking a deep breath, Melanie slung her bag over her shoulder. She tried to walk calmly down the three flights of stairs.
Through the dirty front door window, she could see Allen leaning on a cab, chatting with the driver. Just then, a tall blonde man walked by them. Both heads swiveled, taking a long look at his ass. She had to chuckle.
“I’d check that out myself,” she whispered.
The day was quite a bit cooler than the day before. Allen took a cigarette from his pocket, along with a gold lighter. As he lit up, he saw Melanie walking toward him. She turned to the homeless man sitting up against the building. “Fred, here’s a little something to eat. Would you save me the glass?” He reached out for the paper bag and cup. With his free hand, he took hers and kissed it. Mumbling something unintelligible to her, she smiled and gave him the flowers.
He placed them up against his leg, cupped his hand around the glass and admired his gift.
A breeze drifted down the street. Melanie’s nipples shriveled from the cold air. Her knee-jerk reaction was to draw her arms up to her chest. Allen noticed and immediately felt embarrassed for her.
A policeman walked by them and stopped to observe Allen. He grabbed Mel’s hand, opened the door to the cab, and helped her in. Walking to the other side, Allen kept an eye on him. He tipped an imaginary cap to the officer and climbed inside. “Broome and Mercer,” he directed and turned to her. “You are adorable!” he said, smiling at Mel. The cabbie stared at him through the rearview mirror.
“Where were you coming from last night?” he asked her.
“My job. I didn’t ask you how your head is.”
He smiled. “It’s fine. Where do you work?”
“In the evenings, I clean some of the buildings at NYU.” She lifted his hair away from the cut. Clicking her tongue at the sight of the half dollar sized bruise developing, she asked, “Did you ice this?”
“No. How old are you?”
“20. And you?”
“24. Where are you from originally?”
“Upstate New York. A tiny town no one’s ever heard of.”
“Is that where you learned to fight?” he asked with a smile.
The color seemed to drain from her face. A silence hung between them until the cab hit a pothole that sent them both leaning hard to the right. She caught Allen as he fell against her.
Her loud, nervous laugh made its debut, and it certainly could draw attention.
“Oh my! Well, I love that sound!” he said.
The cab pulled over and made a hard stop. “Broome and Mercer, Mr. Shandi.” Allen’s tight pants forced him to lean to the left awkwardly. Jamming his right hand in his front pocket, he retrieved a bundle of bills. Mel glanced down at his hands. The bulge to the left of the bottom of his zipper caught her off guard. She very quickly looked away. He gave the cabbie a $5 tip.
“Thank you, Mr. Shandi!” His hand began to tremble as he put his money away. She took notice, and he caught that. He exited, went to her side of the cab and opened the door. Offering her his left hand, he helped her climb out.
“Are you hungry? I’m hungry. Let’s get lunch. My treat,” he said, looking across the street. He grabbed her hand and they sprinted through the traffic. Horns began honking, and a few cars stopped short. He held his hand up in a thanks gesture. She loved the way his hair bounced as he trotted. They entered a narrow eatery. A decidedly gay man welcomed Allen.
“Mr. Shandi, it’s so good to see you again. Your table is ready.” Other couples that had been waiting were not regulars or did not carry the same weight as Allen. She did not know what to make of this.
They were seated across from one another in a dark and quiet corner. Paper menus were brought to the table by a pretty young lady. “What can I get you to drink, Mr. Shandi?” she asked in a coquettish manner. She reached past Melanie’s face to light the candle and replaced the dirty ashtray with a clean one.
“What would you like, Mel?”
No one had called her that in at least five years.
“Coffee please, with milk?” she asked, looking at the waitress.
“I’ll have the same.”
The waitress placed her hand on his shoulder and said, “You’ve got it, Honey.” She walked away with quite a sway in her hips. Mel grinned and looked over to see Allen reaching for her over the table. He took a lock of her curly hair and rolled it between his fingers.
“If mermaids were real, this is the kind of hair they would have.”
She laughed as her face turned red. “Wow. I’ve never heard that before.” The art that was curiously placed up against the wall caught her eye. One piece in particular stood out. “Take a peek at that one! It’s a kaleidoscope!” She turned her attention back to his face. He’d been staring at her. Feeling embarrassed, she pretended to go over the menu. “Where are you from?” Mel asked.
“I’m not an interesting person,” he said while lighting a cigarette. “Would you like one?” he offered.
“No, thanks. I don’t want to hear your deepest, darkest secrets. How about, what do you do for a living? I feel like I’m the only one not in on it. Everybody knows you. I’ve lived here for five months, and I have no idea what you do or why you are so,” she paused, “beloved.”
“Beloved. That’s interesting.” He propped up his elbow on the table, and he rested his chin in his hand. The smoke from his cigarette curled up around his face. She sat back in the chair and crossed her ankle over her knee. Lacing her fingers together, she rested her hands in her lap. Giving him an “I’ve got all day” look, she took a deep breath.
Tapping his cigarette on the ashtray, he asked, “Have you ever heard of a clothing line called ‘Cleo’?”
“Yes. Do you work for her?”
“Well, I am her, so to speak. I named it after a knot I created for a necktie.” He pointed to the one that hung from his neck. It almost appeared to be a braid, and yet it was not. “The business has been open for three and a half years. It was perfect timing for my vision of what young women wanted. And the rest as they say…” he laughed, waving his cigarette in the air.
The waitress returned with the coffee. “Have you decided what you’d like to eat?” she asked, staring directly at Allen.
“Not really. Can we have a few more minutes?”
“Sure, Honey,” she answered and sashayed away, stopping once to look over her shoulder at Allen. But his thoughts were elsewhere.
“Have you always known you were…a visionary?” Mel asked as she stirred her coffee.
Allen glanced around to see if anyone was within earshot. He whispered, “What exactly are you asking?”
“My brother made this top for me. Not really my style, but he made it with love.” She gently touched the gauzy fabric around her neck. “Ben knew he was gay from the time he was a little boy,” Mel said softly. Her eyes welled up. “My mother simply ignored that fact. My father had an altogether different take on Ben. The things he would punish him for, well, it would just break your heart. That bastard took off in 1965. Good riddance.”
“Where is Ben now?”
“Buried in the Oswegatchie Cemetery outside of Fine, NY. Fine, NY! Funny, huh?” she laughed to cover the sadness.
More customers had begun to fill the place. The waitress returned once more. “What will it be?” she asked.
“Mel?” he asked.
She kept her head down and asked, “May I have a burger?” A tear rolled down her nose and fell on the menu.
“I’ll have the same,” he said. The waitress jotted it down as she walked away.
He gave Mel his napkin. “Dry your eyes, Sweetness,” then moved to a chair next to her and put his arm around her shoulders. “There are souls that are just too beautiful for this world,” he whispered in her ear. She had thought the very same thing a thousand times.
Two gay teens cautiously approached the table. Mel looked up. “Your fans, Mr. S! If you’ll excuse me…” The young men nearly levitated over a chance to chat with Allen. He watched her walk through a narrow doorway and into the restroom.
Splashing a little water on her face, she looked at her reflection. Her hands gripped the sides of the sink. “Pull it together,” she whispered to herself. Once she’d collected herself with a few deep breaths, she headed back to the table. She stopped and watched Allen as he spoke to them. He listened carefully as they replied and talked about their dreams.
Allen was leaning forward, elbows on his knees and speaking softly. He was incredibly patient as he explained what it took to get where he was. His enormous smile was evidence that he seemed to enjoy this part of his celebrity.
She leaned against the door frame, legs crossed at the ankles, her arms crossed just below her chest.
The two teens stood close to each other. For a second, their pinkies hooked together. Allen grinned. Removing the scarf from his wrist, he tied it around the wrist of the young man on the left, then lifted the tie from his neck and put it on the other fan. He held out his hand to shake theirs.
An older couple seated at a nearby table shook their heads in disapproval. Mel stood and stared at them for a moment, then turned her back and obstructed their view. The boys practically pogoed over to her.
“Johnny, isn’t he amazing?” the shorter of the two asked his boyfriend.
He grinned at Mel and said, “He’s amazing!”
“He certainly is,” she replied. The boys left overwhelmed with joy about what had just happened.
The burgers arrived at the table as Mel sat back down. “Thank you,” she said to the waitress and tried to make eye contact.
Finally, she looked at Mel and said, “You’re welcome.”
“Those kids will be living on that for a long time. That’s just about the sweetest thing I have ever seen,” she told him.
“I could say that about what you did for the guy sitting in front of your building earlier, but I won’t. Mine was sweeter.”
Her laugh reached the customers near the front door. “Sorry,” she said, covering her mouth, trying to muffle the sound. “You are a brat!”
“The boys’ names are Jon and Johnny. Isn’t that sweet? They’re hoping to open a clothing store in the village.” As he set his coffee cup on the saucer, his hand trembled again, rattling both. “Don’t ever apologize for your laugh. I like people that let their emotions out. I’d hate to think what would happen if you tried to hold that inside. It could be catastrophic! Your eyes and brain would be scattered everywhere!” he nearly shrilled, while his hand swiped through the air as if he were carrying a tray of filled coffee cups.
She was about to ask him about his hand, but he stood, excused himself, and headed toward the restroom. His hand, his life. It was quite simply none of her business.
When he returned, they continued to talk for another hour or so. Allen had participated in the Stonewall riots and Mel wanted to learn about every scrap of it.
“I witnessed the woman, Storme DeLarverie, fighting the cops. Some aren’t sure it was her, but I’m convinced it was. When she yelled out to us, ‘Why don’t you guys do something?’ we all went crazy. I guess we all have a boiling point.”
“Truer words, my friend. Ben wanted so much to be a part of it. He never hid who he was. All he ever wanted was to work for, well, someone exactly like you. Damn, you would have loved him,” she said, leaning back in her chair.
“The mob and the cops were involved in the whole thing. Talk about an uphill battle. At that time, the lesbians, queens and gays were not exactly a team.”
“Really? You’d think people treating all of you like dirt would be enough to pull everyone together,” she said.
“Well, to be fair, I’ve seen the same sort of division in the women’s movement.”
“You’re right.” She paused and said, “Things are going to change. They’ve got to. We have no control over who we fall in love with.” She lit one of the two cigarettes she had left. “Would you like one?” she offered. He waved it off. “Do you have somebody special in your life?” she asked.
“Yes, I do. A man named Christopher.” Allen’s eyes lit up.
“How did you meet?”
“Everyone thinks we met at a fashion show. We met while waiting for a cab. Long story short, we ended up sharing one and kept on sharing.”
“How long are the two of you together?”
“Almost a year,” he answered with a smile.
“How did you know it was love?”
“Oh, good Lord. How does anyone ever truly know? I wish I could say that it was love at first sight. Like a bolt of lightning jabbing me in the heart and I would never be the same. I think that’s bull. It never happens that way. How about you? Is there someone special?”
“No,” she said, stood and tossed her bag over her shoulder. She sighed as she thought about the bill. “I don’t even have enough money for a decent tip. I promise I will pay you back.” As she passed the kaleidoscope painting, she stopped to take a closer look but gasped when she saw the price.
He stood and tossed a few bills on the table. As he passed the waitress, he shoved a few additional bills into her pocket. “Thank you, dear.” She smiled at him, then continued to pour coffee into another young man’s cup, flirting away with her latest customer.
It felt good to have something substantial in her stomach for a change. As they left the eatery and headed north, a sophisticated man walked toward them. His Dobermann ignored the noises around him. “Geeze. Check out this beautiful beast,” she gushed. “Excuse me. May I pet him?” she asked the gentleman.
“He can be skittish,” he replied.
Mel held her hand out palm down. She let the dog take its time sniffing, and then she turned her hand over. He began to lick her fingers.
“Well, I’ll be,” said the man.
“My trick is to let them smell me when I just finished eating,” she joked. The gentleman chuckled as he and his pet went on with their walk.
“You like dogs?” Allen asked.
“To be honest, I love them. Dogs are such wonderful creatures. They love you no matter what. That’s hard to find.”
“Let me get a cab.” There were none in sight. While they waited at the curb, a policeman began to cross the street and headed toward them. Allen shoved his hand into his pockets and quietly asked, “Would you take my arm?”
Mel did not realize what was happening but did what he had asked. It was then that she noticed the officer. Mel laid her head on his shoulder and focused her gaze on a couple window shopping across the street. Once he had passed, she removed her arm from his. “I hate that fucking shit,” she hissed. Allen looked down at her face. Her eyes were blazing. He waved down an approaching cab, and they piled in.
“You can’t let it get to you,” he said in a matter-of fact kind of way. He turned his attention to the cabbie and said, “West Central Park and 69th.” This time, she accepted when he offered a cigarette.
Pulling her hair back, she leaned into the lighter’s flame. She sighed. “I’m not able to pay for anything, and it’s driving me nuts. I’m embarrassed,” and sighed again. “As soon as I…”
“Later, OK?” he asked and patted her hand.
She could not help but look up at all the high-reaching buildings that stood in Manhattan. “I can never get over just how immense this place is.” Her head was just about upside down, trying to get the best possible view.
“Yes. You are adorable.” She didn’t hear him. The city and all its energy had her full attention. Allen turned to the gorgeous driver. When they arrived at his address, the cabbie thanked Allen for the tip. He also handed him a slip of paper with his name and number on it.
Allen just smiled and put it in his pocket.
A uniformed doorman held open the heavy glass door. “Good afternoon, Mr. Shandi.”
“Hey there, George. How are Christina and the baby?”
“They are wonderful, thanks for asking.”
“Come on. You must have a picture, yes?”
With that, George pulled his wallet out of his pocket and opened it to a photo.
“Oh,” Allen said with a sigh. “Oh my gosh. They are lovely. Is Penelope about four months old now? Look at these beautiful women, Mel.”
She took the wallet. The woman in the photo looked thrilled to be a mom. Little Penelope’s toothless grin was precious. “You are a very lucky man,” she said placing her hand on her abdomen. Still smiling, she handed it back to him.
“Yes, I am.” George took a few seconds to look at the picture before putting it away.
“By the way, Christopher has taken Daphne for a walk.”
Allen gave him a wink. “Thanks, George.”
The elevator required a unique key to go to the penthouse. Mel and Allen rode it nine floors up. When the elevator doors opened, they stepped into a small area with a large door across the way. He opened it and they entered an extravagant vestibule. Mel had never seen or could even imagine such wealth. An older gentleman greeted Allen with his mail and messages.
He looked inquisitively at Melanie.
Allen said, “This is my sweet friend, Melanie. Mel, this is Quinten. If you need or want anything, this is your man.”
Mel extended her hand out to Quinten and said, “Nice to meet you.” He hesitated and looked at Allen. Allen grinned.
He took her hand and said, “It’s very nice to meet you. Would you prefer Mel or Melanie?”
“Either is fine. May I use the bathroom?”
“Of course, follow me, please.”
The bathroom was straight ahead and to the right. It was below a winding staircase with full bookshelves. Quinten lightly pressed the spine of a red and black book, and a door opened outward. Orange-yellow light spilled out onto the tiled floor.
“I’ve never actually seen a secret door. Very cool! Thank you,” she said and went inside. The dominant color was red, and the accent colors were black, gold and purple. Tiles of red with gold swirls outlined in black covered the bottom half of the walls. The upper half was crimson. She was sure the entire room was larger than her apartment. There were several black and red velvet ottomans and a purple and gold chaise lounge in a sitting area. On the other side of a half wall was the toilet and a bidet alongside it. Over the double sinks hung an enormous mirror with an ornate frame. She set her bag on the black marble counter between the sinks. As she sat on the toilet, she tried to take all of it in. “And this is just the bathroom,” she whispered. Once she’d finished, she washed her hands and raked her fingers through her hair.
Allen was waiting for her. “I’d like to show you something.” They went up the stairs and off to the left. After passing several rooms, Allen held open the door to a bedroom. She flashed him a confused expression.
“Oh! No. This isn’t one of those ‘I’d like to show you my etchings’ snares. I wanted to show you a few things from my collection. It’s through the doorway on the left.”
She did not budge. “Wait here,” he said and disappeared into that room. As he came back, he draped pieces of clothing on hangers across the bed. Spreading them out, he chose a backless sequin-covered halter top jumpsuit in champagne gold. “Isn’t this scrumptious?”
“It’s dazzling. But it’s not my style.”
He looked at the remainder of what was on the bed. “That’s the second time you’ve mentioned your style. What is your style, exactly?”
“I like a less feminine look, you know? I’ve always been a tomboy,” she said timidly. “Do you design things for men?”
The sound of quickly clicking toenails on the wood floor grew louder. With that, a magnificent Rottweiler burst into the room. “Daphne-love!” gushed Allen.
Catching his breath, Christopher followed. He stood over six feet tall, blonde hair parted on the right and trimmed with precision. Although he was slender, he was muscular the way 20-year-old men often are. “I’m back from our daily tug. She is going to pull my arm out one of these days,” he said.
Daphne’s interest shifted to the new scent in the room. Her full tail swished back and forth as she sniffed Mel’s feet and legs.
“Who is this?” Christopher asked, inspecting Mel.
She stuck out her hand, “I’m Mel Foster.” He hesitated for a moment, then took her hand. “It’s very nice to meet you,” she said. Still looking at Christopher, she asked, “Daphne’s tail is intact? I don’t think I’ve ever seen that. She’s a beauty.”
“We got her when she was a pup, and we specifically told them not to do that. It’s unthinkable,” Allen huffed.
Mel was on her knees, along with Christopher, cuddling and scratching her belly. “We had a large dog when I was little. Just a mutt, but at least 100 pounds. My father found a harness for her and it helped when we had to walk her.” Daphne jumped onto Mel knocking her back with her legs folded under her and began licking her face. Mel laughed and hugged her around the neck.
“Daphne!” Allen laughed. “Come! Come here, my girl.” She obediently went to his side.
“May I have a washcloth or something?” Mel asked once Allen had lured Daphne away.
Christopher answered, “Sure.” Mel followed him out of the bedroom and down the hall.
“Second door on the left,” he said with a forced smile.
She pushed the door, but it did not close all the way. Splashing her face with warm soap and water removed the drool from her face. Two black velvet ottomans placed side by side with a tiny table between were in the corner. She sat and took advantage of the small, crystal ashtray. Digging through her bag, she retrieved her last cigarette, matches and a hair clip. Taking a deep drag, she grabbed everything and went to the mirror. With the cigarette hanging from her mouth, she pulled her thick hair and piled it on the crown of her head. The extra-large leather slide barely fit over her mop of curls. She pushed the stick through the holes to secure everything in place. Invariably, five or six tendrils hung down around her neck, dripping down over her back and shoulders. She could hear a discussion growing louder coming from the bedroom. “She will end up becoming just another fag-hag for you. What is this, the fifth? I do not need yet another person hanging around watching us as if you and I were a freakshow,” Christopher said firmly.
“You are wrong about her. She’s one of us. Her ideas about women’s clothing are perfect for what’s down the road,” said Allen.
“Is that how you met her?” There was a pause.
Trying to make her presence known, Mel tugged the door open and stomped heavily onto the floor. Daphne flounced toward her. “I’m going to have to get going, little girl.” Holding either side of her enormous head, she kissed her loudly.
“Your hair. I love it!” declared Allen. “I have a proposal for you, Mel. You brought up a more masculine feel for women’s clothing. Would you help me bring that idea to life?” Allen asked.
“I don’t know the first thing about fashion.”
Christopher laughed, “You’ve got that right.”
“Now, now. Let’s not be bitchy,” said Allen.
Mel motioned toward Christopher while looking at Allen and said, “He understands that I do not…”
“Sometimes, all you need to know is what you like and what you don’t like,” said Allen. “Like art.” He grabbed her hand and led her to the back of the bedroom. After opening the double-door walk-in closet, he began to look through his clothes. He chose a white button-down shirt from his closet. “What would you do with this?” He held it out to her. His right arm was across his chest and was clutching his left bicep. His forearm extended outward with the palm of his hand facing the ceiling, and the shirt dangled from his fingertip. She would come to know this as his “What say you?” pose.
“Seriously?” She exhaled. Taking the shirt from him, she hung it from an indentation on one of the columns of the four-poster bed. Christopher gasped at the thought of damage done to the tiger maple column. “I would make it sleeveless and shorten the front to waist length.” She turned it around. Christopher stepped in and held it for her. “Thanks, Christopher. It could be darted a bit to fit my form, then lengthened the shirttail to fall just passed the…” she patted her rear.
“Ass?” Christopher asked. Allen gave him a look.
“Well, I was gonna say cheeks, but either fit. Split it up the middle to about two inches below the waistline. It would end up kind of like tails on a tux. If you could give it lapels rather than a collar, I think that would be something I’d like.”
“What would you wear with it?” asked Allen.
Taking a moment to think, she finally said, “I would wear straight leg jeans and man boots up to my knees. You know, the kind that you tie up in the front without the spiky heels.”
Allen looked over at Christopher and said, “Do you see what I mean?”
“Do you design clothes also, Christopher?”
He seemed insulted by the question. “I am a model,” he answered in a sharp tone.
“I’m sorry. I don’t read many magazines.” Pointing out her appearance with gesturing hands, she laughed, “Just look at me for crying out loud!”
“I have to give you that,” Christopher said.
“Honey, that’s not…” Allen started to say.
“But it’s funny and appropriate,” answered Mel. “Allen, thanks for all of this. I’ve got to get going.”
A nearly palpable look went from Allen to Christopher. Christopher shrugged his shoulders and said, “OK,” and he left the room.
“This might be forward, but I…we wondered if you would consider staying with us while we take Cleo in this new direction? This place has several empty rooms. But I think you’d truly love the one on the far end.”
“But I haven’t agreed to the clothing thing.”
He ignored her. She followed him to an enormous room down the hallway. Daphne’s toenails let them know she was right behind them. Everything was covered with sheets except the king-size bed. Sliding glass doors on the far side of the room led to a balcony complete with greenery and furniture. The walls were white, and the furniture was in varying shades of red. As the sun fell low in the sky, it cast a fantastic orangey-pink over everything around her, including Allen.
“Isn’t it gorgeous?”
“Yes, but I have a job,” she said.
He came toward her and held her by the shoulders. “This is an opportunity to grow. It will be your job. Name your price.” She was only aware of his hands on her. Everything else was a blur. “Please?” he asked, batting his eyes again. Allen bent down a bit to meet her eye and was inches from her face. “I need you.”
She paused, then finally said, “Yes. Thank you. Allen, I am so grateful…” but the lump in her throat and tears squelched her ability to speak.
Allen threw his arms around her and she pulled away just a bit. He laughed and said, “I’m sorry. I excite easily!”
“Good to know,” she said, patting him on the back. He laughed into her ear. The sensation of his breath on her neck was incredible and alarming at once. “I have one request.”
“Name it.”
She pulled back and placed her hands on his chest. “I am not a huggee, cuddly, touchy-feely person. Please, don’t take it the wrong way. You are such a great guy, a real gentleman. You would never deliberately hurt anyone. It just makes me uncomfortable.”
He looked into her eyes. “Of course, I can respect that.” He backed away. “I understand, you know. Maybe better than most. I was different, too.” She felt light-headed.
“Are you alright?” he asked.
“Yes. I think I need a shower and a good night’s sleep.”
“Can I have Quinten bring you a bite to eat?”
“No, not right now. If I get hungry, I’ll poke around the kitchen, if that’s OK.”
“It’s fine with me, but Quinten gets a bit touchy when his domain is disturbed.”
“I promise I’ll clean up after myself,” she offered.
“Good Lord, woman, I was joking! Feel free to have anything you’d like.” He left her room and closed the door behind him.
Chapter 3
By the next morning, all of Mel’s belongings had been picked up and delivered to the penthouse. That afternoon, Allen purchased a month’s worth of clothing for her right down to her panties, along with a carton of her favorite cigarettes plus several joints. She sat on the edge of the bed surrounded by all of it, including the jelly jar she’d given to Fred and her prized possession. It was an old lockbox. Taking the key out of her bag, she placed the box on her lap and opened it slowly. Lifting the three photographs of her brother, Benjamin, from inside, she traced his face with her finger. It also contained a spool of fishing line. She looked up to see Allen standing in the doorway. She closed the box and set it aside.
“Would you like a hand putting things away?” he asked.
“I can’t accept all of this.”
“Consider it an advance,” he said. “Anything you dislike will be returned, exchanged, whatever.” He walked toward her.
Mel stood and moved toward the middle of the room. “You could have let my friend keep the glass,” she remarked.
“I did something a little better, I think. I hope you agree. Fred now occupies your old apartment, and I’ve paid up for two years. He has several new outfits, a bit of cash, and will be filling in at your old job until you decide what you want to do. I will find another place for you to live if you think this isn’t working out, but I want you to share your ideas with me,” he said in a serious tone.
She turned away from him. “I’m going to do my very best for you. Thank you for giving me this chance.”
He moved toward her, then thought better of it. Quinten knocked on the door frame.
“Excuse me, Sir. How many for dinner tonight?”
“Six, I think. Very casual, OK?” Allen asked.
“Time?”
“Six-thirty.”
“Is there anything, in particular, you would like tonight, Sir?”
“Mel, if you sat down in a restaurant and could have anything you wanted, what would it be?” Allen asked her.
She chuckled. “I feel as if I’m in a dream, or I’m high. Maybe I’ve died and gone to Heaven.” She asked timidly, “Do you like spaghetti and meatballs and maybe a salad?”
“Perfect. Is that doable, Quinten?”
“Of course, Sir. Can I get you anything in the meantime, Miss Melanie?”
“No thanks, and for God’s sake, drop the Miss. You make me feel as if I’m the character in ‘Gone with the Wind’! Or worse, my mother.”
“Quinten, could you give us a minute?”
“Of course,” he said and went downstairs.
Allen sat on the bench at the foot of the bed. His legs crossed at the knee and leaning back on his hands. “Did I tell you how I ended up living here?” he asked Mel. She shook her head, no. He gestured with his hand for her to sit next to him. She sat beside him with her legs apart, her elbows resting on her thighs and hands folded. He brushed her hair over her shoulder.
“I just want to see your face, OK?”
“Yes,” she answered and looked at him.
“My father owned an oil conglomerate. It doesn’t matter which one. They are all greed-factories. He could buy and sell God, or so he said. The best part is that God got the last laugh. One morning he told his secretary that there were to be no phone calls, no interruptions. He had a massive heart attack at his desk while she typed away just outside his door. Side note, she was also his mistress. An hour and a half later, she poked her head in to ask a question. She found him sweat-soaked and face down in a pool of his vomit. The Man upstairs is a funny guy, don’t you agree?”
“I gather you were not close to him?”
“No one was. My father loved money and fucking women. If he could have figured out a way to bang them with a roll of hundreds on his cock, it would have been his ejaculation of a lifetime.”
“Wow,” she chuckled. “How did your mom take it?”
“Poor thing, she loved him and not for his money. She would tell me about the 19-year-old boy she’d met all those years ago. Generous, kind, hardworking and very gentle with her. Somewhere along the line, he soured. He began drinking to excess and worse, hitting her. He became ruthless.”
“Did he know you are gay?”
“I think if he’d spent just a bit of time with me, he would have. But you must be in the same room with a person, look into their eyes, listen to what they say to learn anything. My wonderful mother died two years after my father. Countless homes, cars, all kinds of ‘things’ had become the property of my brother and me. Did I tell you I have a brother? Keith. Funny guy. A good man. Anyway. He and I sold most of it and gave the money to charities for the homeless, hospitals, but the best was handing out money to anyone that looked like they could use it. We knew this would make the old bastard roll in his grave. Even better, we made the donations in his name.”
“Ooooh, you scoundrels. I love it,” she laughed.
“Quinten has been with our family since before I was born. He is an old-fashioned gentleman’s gentleman. He just can’t help himself. I know for certain there were times that he would intercept when that bastard was after my mom. He’d lie and say there was a phone call or news on TV about my father’s company. My father was so drunk he probably could have distracted him with a ring of keys, …like an infant. All that being said, Quinten is who he is, and we accept him that way. Alright?”
Her face was beet red. “Yes. Understood. I’ll make it right.” She looked back on the bed and asked, “I hate to sound like such a girl, but what are you wearing tonight?”
Allen laughed. “How do jeans and a shirt sound? Shoes are optional.”
“Comfortable, thank you.”
Allen’s chef, Wyatt Edmonds, had taken the time to ask Mel about her selection for dinner, right down to the amount of garlic or basil. He stood at six foot four and two hundred forty pounds of muscle. He looked extremely intimidating, but that turned out to be completely wrong. He was a gentle and soft-spoken man. It was moving to see his interest in what would make her happy.
That evening, softly playing jazz hung in the background. Allen and Christopher were in one of two black loveseats in a cozy area of the living room. The other loveseat was directly across from them, with two red high-back chairs between them facing the fireplace. A black lacquered coffee table sat between it all.
The first to arrive were two women that worked in the garment district. Eric had red cropped hair and was wearing a man’s blue button-down shirt tucked into her black jeans with a matching blue belt and sneakers.
Mel asked Eric, “May I ask, do you consider yourself a ‘he’ or ‘she’?”
“He, and thank you for asking.” His girlfriend, Meghan also had red hair, but shoulder length. She wore a short denim skirt, a red sweater and black high heels. After the introductions, Allen offered drinks. Eric would have his usual Pabst Blue Ribbon beer in a pint glass while Meghan preferred white wine. Rather than help, Christopher called out for a vodka and tonic. As Allen gave Eric and Meghan their drinks, he heard the elevator door open and excused himself. Mel went to the bar to make Christopher’s drink. She brought it to him and asked, “What do you think Allen will have?”
“I have no idea,” he answered, not meeting her eyes.
“Mel, meet Zora Preston. She is a buyer for one of the high-end stores on 5th Avenue. Zora, Mel Foster.”
She was a tall, curvy African American woman with a beautiful, giant Afro. She wore a tight-fitting, sleeveless black turtleneck sweater, large gold hoop earrings and a floor-length striped skirt in all the colors of the rainbow. Mel smiled and shook her hand. “Do you prefer Mel or Melanie?” Zora asked in a soft and sexy voice.
“Either is fine.”
“Then, Melanie, it is.”
“Your hair is gorgeous!” Mel gushed.
“As is yours,” she responded, taking a handful and twirling it between her fingers.
“I told her just how beautiful you are, Mel. And did I lie?” Allen asked, holding his hands to her like the statuesque women on game shows would when displaying a new car.
Mel became an entirely new shade of red. “Allen, please.” She laughed and turned to Zora. “If you know Allen at all, then you know how generous he is with his compliments. Zora, what can I get you to drink?”
“I’ll have whatever you’re having,” she smiled, putting her hand on top of Mel’s. The sound of ice cubes clinking together came from Christopher. He’d raised his glass and shook it. Allen snatched it from his hand, then he and Mel went to the bar.
“What’s going on, Allen?”
“I’m sorry for Christopher’s behavior.”
“That’s not what I meant. Why is Zora here?”
“I thought the two of you might hit it off,” he said innocently.
“Oh, good Christ,” she said, leaning on the marble surface. She closed her eyes and said, “Are you under the impression that I am a lesbian?”
“Well, yes.”
“Oh, my God,” she whispered, then laughed. “I can’t be upset with you. A tomboy is a stone’s throw from that. No, I’m not a lesbian. This beautiful woman was brought here as my date?”
“I am so sorry,” he said, thoroughly embarrassed. “Let me talk to Zora.”
“No. That’s OK. Let me,” Mel said. After handing Christopher his drink, she asked, “Zora, would you mind checking out the wine selections?”
“Not at all.”
Allen watched out of the corner of his eye as Mel placed her hand on Zora’s back. Mel smiled at her and spoke softly. A look of confusion came across Zora’s face as Mel spoke but quickly changed to a warm smile. Zora placed her hand on Mel’s. She kissed her on the forehead and, with her thumb, wiped the lipstick it left behind. Their attention turned to the wine. Mel laughed loudly at something Zora said. Christopher smirked at Mel. “Idiot,” he said under his breath. Allen shot him a look.
The evening continued as if nothing had happened. The dining room table was set, complete with two flower arrangements. Allen and Christopher sat at opposite ends of the table. Eric and Meghan sat on one side and Mel and Zora on the other.
Mel asked Eric, “How long have you two been together?”
Eric lifted Meghan’s hand from under the table and kissed it. “Two years. The first time I saw Meghan, I was hooked. I couldn’t take my eyes off her. Then she turned and looked at me and smiled. I couldn’t believe it. Everything came into focus. People say things like the sky is bluer, the birds sing more sweetly, and that is the truth. She was just what I needed in my life,” Eric said and leaned in for a kiss.

PART ONE — HER STYLE
Chapter 1—September 6th, 1972
The night breeze was a welcome sensation after spending six hours working up a sweat cleaning one of the NYU buildings off Washington Square. This seedy side of town always put Melanie on edge. The drenched bandana covering her hair would stay in place until she was safely back in her room. Reaching into her purple bag, she found her keys. Before putting one foot on the sidewalk, she made sure the keys were spread apart and protruding between her fingers.
The walk to the Village Plaza Hotel took as long as smoking one cigarette, three quarters if she was nervous. Three drags in, she heard a low, angry voice. A lighter voice responded as if confused. In the darkness of a doorway off to the left, Melanie could make out a large man hanging over a smaller person.
“Faggot, yer gonna get yer fuckin’ ass kicked,” he growled while raising his massive fist back over his shoulder. It was then that Mel realized the smaller person was a man trying to cover his head with his hands.
Quickly, she stepped toward them. “Honey, where have you been?” she asked, pulling the bandana off her head. The growler, still clenching his fist, turned to look at her. For just a few seconds, he stared at her. Her dirty bell-bottoms and loosely fitting t-shirt covering her slender body did not distract him from the long, curly-cue, strawberry blonde hair that framed her beautiful face and fell to her elbows. With one hand on her hip, she flicked the cigarette to the side. For a fleeting moment, the only sounds were a few crickets communicating with each other. She took that time to smile and step toward him. When she was close enough to see him begin to smile back, her right arm swung around, connecting with his left cheek and eye. The punch itself was not remarkable, but the keys split his face and it had begun to bleed. He lost his balance just enough to allow her to finish the job by kneeing him in the groin. He yelped in pain as he fell over, clutching his crotch. Placing her arm under the light voiced man’s arm, she brought him to his feet.
All he could do was stare at her. Not for her hair and sweet face, but because he was dumbstruck. He’d seen only one other woman fight like that.
Grabbing his hand, they ran down Washington Place. Twice, she looked back to see if the beast was behind them. Tugging him to the right, they ran into the hotel. The man behind the desk in the lobby yelled, “Where are you going?”
“It’s me, Melanie, Mr. Jones.” The three flights of stairs took the last of her energy. Looking back over her shoulder, she felt a little safer. She had not let go of his hand. At times, he’d run right beside her, others ahead of her. They stopped on the third floor. She let go of him and bent over, hands on her knees, trying to catch her breath. With a sweeping motion, she tossed her hair back and stood upright. In front of her darkened doorway, she finally looked over at him. Once her eyes adjusted to the light, she saw his face. In the shadows of a dimly lit bare bulb screwed into the ceiling, she could see his smile. He leaned against the wall with his hand shaking against his chest.
“You’ll be OK,” she tried to say in a calm voice.
His long, dark brown, shiny hair fell in layers just below his shoulders. A pair of Aviator prescription glasses rested on his significant and masculine nose. Eyeliner enhanced his almond-shaped brown eyes and long lashes. Her eyes fell to his mouth, and she couldn’t help but stare at his lips. They were the kind that made women jealous. Both the top and bottom were full. The deep dimples were like perpetual parentheses on the edges of that extraordinary mouth. Once he stood up straight, Melanie guessed he was only a few inches taller than her, putting him at about 5’11”. A bead of blood rolled down over his eyelid.
“Looks like he got a punch in.” She handed him a tissue from her bag, put her blood-covered door key in the worn lock and opened it. He followed her inside.
The kitchen was no more than an area in the otherwise Lilliputian room. She pulled the only chair from the tiny table and motioned for him to sit.
“What’s your name?” she asked as she rinsed off her keys.
“Allen. Shandi.”
She smiled. “Like the beer?”
“No,” he smiled, “as in boisterous.” He looked around the room. It was shabby but clean. Not like anything he’d ever experienced. “And what is your name? I heard you say, ‘Melanie.’”
“Yeah. Melanie. Mel. Foster.”
“As in cultivate?”
“Nah. Like the Grant’s.”
His laugh was light and feminine. Mel pulled a small container from under the twin bed and put it on the threadbare rug next to him. Inside was an assortment of necessities. It contained a sewing needle stuck in a spool of white thread, a hammer, a box of band-aids, a roll of tape, and a small glass container of hydrogen peroxide. She retrieved a band-aid and the bottle.
“Would you take off your glasses, please?”
“Truth be told, my vision is horrible. I can only see about a foot in front of me without them,” he told her.
“I’d like to clean out that cut. That bastard was filthy. It wouldn’t surprise me if you caught something just by breathing in the same space as that creep did. Your glasses could use a wipe, too.” He removed them and tilted his head towards her. “This might sting a bit,” Mel warned. She lifted his thick hair away from his forehead. The aroma of pot and sandalwood floated up to her and it made her smile. She lightly patted his head with a paper towel with the tiniest bit of hydrogen peroxide.
“Jesus!” He winced.
“I’m sorry,” she said, and blew on the cut.
“I haven’t thanked you for saving me from that Neanderthal. What would ever make you go after something that size?”
She paused. “The ‘f’ word.”
“Fuck?”
“Faggot.” The very word made her purse her lips. “May I have your glasses?” She took them, gave them a quick cleaning on her shirt, and held them out to him.
He reached for her hand holding the paper towel, but she quickly pulled away. He was startled by her reaction. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean anything by it,” he said. “I should go. Thank you for your care and time.” He put his glasses back on, then got up and walked to the door.
She was still holding the bloodied paper towel as he closed the door behind him. Her head fell back. “Oh, good Christ,” she said, disappointed in herself. “Let it go!” she whispered.
Once she’d quickly washed the dirty coffee cup from that morning and rinsed herself off in front of the sink, she fell onto the bed. The sounds of New York City outside her window had finally become familiar to her. That was not what kept her from relaxing. The image of his face kept returning to her. Allen was beautiful. He’s gay. She punched her pillow in hopes of making it more comfortable and closed her eyes. Tomorrow is Saturday. She began a mental list of things to do. Things like laundry and groceries and such needed to be done. But then, she heard his laugh in her head. Her eyes opened, and she sighed. There will not be much in the way of sleep tonight. “Happy birthday to me,” she whispered.
Chapter 2
It was nearly noon when she opened her eyes. A light knock on the door startled her. She jumped out of bed and put on her robe.
“Who’s there?”
“I have a delivery for Miss Grant,” a deep voice said.
“Miss Grant?” she whispered, and then it clicked. “Hold on.” Grabbing her bag off the floor, she searched inside until she found a quarter at the bottom. Pulling the door open just a crack, she could see an enormous assortment of purple and white flowers. She opened it wide enough to take them. Slowly, the bouquet lowered, and Allen’s eyes came into view. He playfully batted them at her.
She laughed. “What’s this?”
“It’s just a modest gift in appreciation of your bravery. Also…” He handed her a large, beautifully wrapped box. She took it from him.
“Come on in, please. You didn’t have to do this.”
He placed the flowers on the tiny table, then turned to her. After adjusting his glasses against his nose, Allen stood with his hands behind his back. His skin-tight, shiny black jeans flared out into a modest bell. The shoes looked like women’s leather square-toed chunky-heeled pumps, but he made them look great. The tan tank top was sheer enough that the hair on his chest and the outline of his nipples were evident. Around his neck he wore a slender black leather tie that was loosened and hung low on his chest. The knot itself was strange. A black silk scarf was wrapped several times around his left wrist and tied, leaving the ends hanging about six inches.
She sat on the bed, pulled off the wrapping, and lifted the lid. Inside was a proper first aid kit, a sewing kit complete with scissors, and a few smaller tools complete with two kinds of screwdrivers, a tape measure, pliers and an adjustable wrench.
“This is too much!”
He sat near her and took out an ‘L’ shaped piece of metal and examined it. “What is this?”
“It’s an Allen wrench,” she laughed. His smile disappeared, and he placed it back in the box. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to….” Tentatively, she patted his shoulder and rose from the bed. “Would you like a cup of coffee? All I have is instant.” She clutched her robe at the neck and started to open one of the two cabinets.
“I was hoping I could take you out for a bite. It’s a lovely day. We could walk a bit if you’d like.” Mel did not answer. “We could take a cab if you prefer.”
“I…I don’t have any clean clothes. Today is laundry day for me. Can I take a raincheck?” she finally asked, not meeting his eye as her face reddened.
“Well, this is all too perfect! How long will it take for you to put on whatever you would have worn to the laundromat? In 15 minutes, I’ll have a cab out front, alright?”
“I don’t…”
“Please?” He held out his hand. She looked down, smiled and swatted her fingertips with his.
“Alright, then. Meet me outside in fifteen minutes,” Allen said with a smile. Just before he closed the door, he looked back at her, flashed that incredible smile again, and gave a quick nod in a way that somehow relaxed any of her suspicious feelings.
She lifted a pair of hip huggers from the top of a pile of clothes in her closet and shook them out. Her only clean shirt was a lilac sleeveless turtleneck her brother made for her. She brushed her teeth with one hand and ran her fingers through her thick hair with the other. Laying out two pieces of bread on the counter, she assembled a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. She rinsed out the paper coffee cup she’d saved from the day before and filled it with milk. The lid still fit. There were far too many beautiful flowers in her bouquet not to share. She chose three cosmoses, cut the stems, and set them in a little water-filled jelly jar. Splashing water on her face, she looked at her reflection in the aged mirror on the wall. As ready as I’ll ever be. Taking a deep breath, Melanie slung her bag over her shoulder. She tried to walk calmly down the three flights of stairs.
Through the dirty front door window, she could see Allen leaning on a cab, chatting with the driver. Just then, a tall blonde man walked by them. Both heads swiveled, taking a long look at his ass. She had to chuckle.
“I’d check that out myself,” she whispered.
The day was quite a bit cooler than the day before. Allen took a cigarette from his pocket, along with a gold lighter. As he lit up, he saw Melanie walking toward him. She turned to the homeless man sitting up against the building. “Fred, here’s a little something to eat. Would you save me the glass?” He reached out for the paper bag and cup. With his free hand, he took hers and kissed it. Mumbling something unintelligible to her, she smiled and gave him the flowers.
He placed them up against his leg, cupped his hand around the glass and admired his gift.
A breeze drifted down the street. Melanie’s nipples shriveled from the cold air. Her knee-jerk reaction was to draw her arms up to her chest. Allen noticed and immediately felt embarrassed for her.
A policeman walked by them and stopped to observe Allen. He grabbed Mel’s hand, opened the door to the cab, and helped her in. Walking to the other side, Allen kept an eye on him. He tipped an imaginary cap to the officer and climbed inside. “Broome and Mercer,” he directed and turned to her. “You are adorable!” he said, smiling at Mel. The cabbie stared at him through the rearview mirror.
“Where were you coming from last night?” he asked her.
“My job. I didn’t ask you how your head is.”
He smiled. “It’s fine. Where do you work?”
“In the evenings, I clean some of the buildings at NYU.” She lifted his hair away from the cut. Clicking her tongue at the sight of the half dollar sized bruise developing, she asked, “Did you ice this?”
“No. How old are you?”
“20. And you?”
“24. Where are you from originally?”
“Upstate New York. A tiny town no one’s ever heard of.”
“Is that where you learned to fight?” he asked with a smile.
The color seemed to drain from her face. A silence hung between them until the cab hit a pothole that sent them both leaning hard to the right. She caught Allen as he fell against her.
Her loud, nervous laugh made its debut, and it certainly could draw attention.
“Oh my! Well, I love that sound!” he said.
The cab pulled over and made a hard stop. “Broome and Mercer, Mr. Shandi.” Allen’s tight pants forced him to lean to the left awkwardly. Jamming his right hand in his front pocket, he retrieved a bundle of bills. Mel glanced down at his hands. The bulge to the left of the bottom of his zipper caught her off guard. She very quickly looked away. He gave the cabbie a $5 tip.
“Thank you, Mr. Shandi!” His hand began to tremble as he put his money away. She took notice, and he caught that. He exited, went to her side of the cab and opened the door. Offering her his left hand, he helped her climb out.
“Are you hungry? I’m hungry. Let’s get lunch. My treat,” he said, looking across the street. He grabbed her hand and they sprinted through the traffic. Horns began honking, and a few cars stopped short. He held his hand up in a thanks gesture. She loved the way his hair bounced as he trotted. They entered a narrow eatery. A decidedly gay man welcomed Allen.
“Mr. Shandi, it’s so good to see you again. Your table is ready.” Other couples that had been waiting were not regulars or did not carry the same weight as Allen. She did not know what to make of this.
They were seated across from one another in a dark and quiet corner. Paper menus were brought to the table by a pretty young lady. “What can I get you to drink, Mr. Shandi?” she asked in a coquettish manner. She reached past Melanie’s face to light the candle and replaced the dirty ashtray with a clean one.
“What would you like, Mel?”
No one had called her that in at least five years.
“Coffee please, with milk?” she asked, looking at the waitress.
“I’ll have the same.”
The waitress placed her hand on his shoulder and said, “You’ve got it, Honey.” She walked away with quite a sway in her hips. Mel grinned and looked over to see Allen reaching for her over the table. He took a lock of her curly hair and rolled it between his fingers.
“If mermaids were real, this is the kind of hair they would have.”
She laughed as her face turned red. “Wow. I’ve never heard that before.” The art that was curiously placed up against the wall caught her eye. One piece in particular stood out. “Take a peek at that one! It’s a kaleidoscope!” She turned her attention back to his face. He’d been staring at her. Feeling embarrassed, she pretended to go over the menu. “Where are you from?” Mel asked.
“I’m not an interesting person,” he said while lighting a cigarette. “Would you like one?” he offered.
“No, thanks. I don’t want to hear your deepest, darkest secrets. How about, what do you do for a living? I feel like I’m the only one not in on it. Everybody knows you. I’ve lived here for five months, and I have no idea what you do or why you are so,” she paused, “beloved.”
“Beloved. That’s interesting.” He propped up his elbow on the table, and he rested his chin in his hand. The smoke from his cigarette curled up around his face. She sat back in the chair and crossed her ankle over her knee. Lacing her fingers together, she rested her hands in her lap. Giving him an “I’ve got all day” look, she took a deep breath.
Tapping his cigarette on the ashtray, he asked, “Have you ever heard of a clothing line called ‘Cleo’?”
“Yes. Do you work for her?”
“Well, I am her, so to speak. I named it after a knot I created for a necktie.” He pointed to the one that hung from his neck. It almost appeared to be a braid, and yet it was not. “The business has been open for three and a half years. It was perfect timing for my vision of what young women wanted. And the rest as they say…” he laughed, waving his cigarette in the air.
The waitress returned with the coffee. “Have you decided what you’d like to eat?” she asked, staring directly at Allen.
“Not really. Can we have a few more minutes?”
“Sure, Honey,” she answered and sashayed away, stopping once to look over her shoulder at Allen. But his thoughts were elsewhere.
“Have you always known you were…a visionary?” Mel asked as she stirred her coffee.
Allen glanced around to see if anyone was within earshot. He whispered, “What exactly are you asking?”
“My brother made this top for me. Not really my style, but he made it with love.” She gently touched the gauzy fabric around her neck. “Ben knew he was gay from the time he was a little boy,” Mel said softly. Her eyes welled up. “My mother simply ignored that fact. My father had an altogether different take on Ben. The things he would punish him for, well, it would just break your heart. That bastard took off in 1965. Good riddance.”
“Where is Ben now?”
“Buried in the Oswegatchie Cemetery outside of Fine, NY. Fine, NY! Funny, huh?” she laughed to cover the sadness.
More customers had begun to fill the place. The waitress returned once more. “What will it be?” she asked.
“Mel?” he asked.
She kept her head down and asked, “May I have a burger?” A tear rolled down her nose and fell on the menu.
“I’ll have the same,” he said. The waitress jotted it down as she walked away.
He gave Mel his napkin. “Dry your eyes, Sweetness,” then moved to a chair next to her and put his arm around her shoulders. “There are souls that are just too beautiful for this world,” he whispered in her ear. She had thought the very same thing a thousand times.
Two gay teens cautiously approached the table. Mel looked up. “Your fans, Mr. S! If you’ll excuse me…” The young men nearly levitated over a chance to chat with Allen. He watched her walk through a narrow doorway and into the restroom.
Splashing a little water on her face, she looked at her reflection. Her hands gripped the sides of the sink. “Pull it together,” she whispered to herself. Once she’d collected herself with a few deep breaths, she headed back to the table. She stopped and watched Allen as he spoke to them. He listened carefully as they replied and talked about their dreams.
Allen was leaning forward, elbows on his knees and speaking softly. He was incredibly patient as he explained what it took to get where he was. His enormous smile was evidence that he seemed to enjoy this part of his celebrity.
She leaned against the door frame, legs crossed at the ankles, her arms crossed just below her chest.
The two teens stood close to each other. For a second, their pinkies hooked together. Allen grinned. Removing the scarf from his wrist, he tied it around the wrist of the young man on the left, then lifted the tie from his neck and put it on the other fan. He held out his hand to shake theirs.
An older couple seated at a nearby table shook their heads in disapproval. Mel stood and stared at them for a moment, then turned her back and obstructed their view. The boys practically pogoed over to her.
“Johnny, isn’t he amazing?” the shorter of the two asked his boyfriend.
He grinned at Mel and said, “He’s amazing!”
“He certainly is,” she replied. The boys left overwhelmed with joy about what had just happened.
The burgers arrived at the table as Mel sat back down. “Thank you,” she said to the waitress and tried to make eye contact.
Finally, she looked at Mel and said, “You’re welcome.”
“Those kids will be living on that for a long time. That’s just about the sweetest thing I have ever seen,” she told him.
“I could say that about what you did for the guy sitting in front of your building earlier, but I won’t. Mine was sweeter.”
Her laugh reached the customers near the front door. “Sorry,” she said, covering her mouth, trying to muffle the sound. “You are a brat!”
“The boys’ names are Jon and Johnny. Isn’t that sweet? They’re hoping to open a clothing store in the village.” As he set his coffee cup on the saucer, his hand trembled again, rattling both. “Don’t ever apologize for your laugh. I like people that let their emotions out. I’d hate to think what would happen if you tried to hold that inside. It could be catastrophic! Your eyes and brain would be scattered everywhere!” he nearly shrilled, while his hand swiped through the air as if he were carrying a tray of filled coffee cups.
She was about to ask him about his hand, but he stood, excused himself, and headed toward the restroom. His hand, his life. It was quite simply none of her business.
When he returned, they continued to talk for another hour or so. Allen had participated in the Stonewall riots and Mel wanted to learn about every scrap of it.
“I witnessed the woman, Storme DeLarverie, fighting the cops. Some aren’t sure it was her, but I’m convinced it was. When she yelled out to us, ‘Why don’t you guys do something?’ we all went crazy. I guess we all have a boiling point.”
“Truer words, my friend. Ben wanted so much to be a part of it. He never hid who he was. All he ever wanted was to work for, well, someone exactly like you. Damn, you would have loved him,” she said, leaning back in her chair.
“The mob and the cops were involved in the whole thing. Talk about an uphill battle. At that time, the lesbians, queens and gays were not exactly a team.”
“Really? You’d think people treating all of you like dirt would be enough to pull everyone together,” she said.
“Well, to be fair, I’ve seen the same sort of division in the women’s movement.”
“You’re right.” She paused and said, “Things are going to change. They’ve got to. We have no control over who we fall in love with.” She lit one of the two cigarettes she had left. “Would you like one?” she offered. He waved it off. “Do you have somebody special in your life?” she asked.
“Yes, I do. A man named Christopher.” Allen’s eyes lit up.
“How did you meet?”
“Everyone thinks we met at a fashion show. We met while waiting for a cab. Long story short, we ended up sharing one and kept on sharing.”
“How long are the two of you together?”
“Almost a year,” he answered with a smile.
“How did you know it was love?”
“Oh, good Lord. How does anyone ever truly know? I wish I could say that it was love at first sight. Like a bolt of lightning jabbing me in the heart and I would never be the same. I think that’s bull. It never happens that way. How about you? Is there someone special?”
“No,” she said, stood and tossed her bag over her shoulder. She sighed as she thought about the bill. “I don’t even have enough money for a decent tip. I promise I will pay you back.” As she passed the kaleidoscope painting, she stopped to take a closer look but gasped when she saw the price.
He stood and tossed a few bills on the table. As he passed the waitress, he shoved a few additional bills into her pocket. “Thank you, dear.” She smiled at him, then continued to pour coffee into another young man’s cup, flirting away with her latest customer.
It felt good to have something substantial in her stomach for a change. As they left the eatery and headed north, a sophisticated man walked toward them. His Dobermann ignored the noises around him. “Geeze. Check out this beautiful beast,” she gushed. “Excuse me. May I pet him?” she asked the gentleman.
“He can be skittish,” he replied.
Mel held her hand out palm down. She let the dog take its time sniffing, and then she turned her hand over. He began to lick her fingers.
“Well, I’ll be,” said the man.
“My trick is to let them smell me when I just finished eating,” she joked. The gentleman chuckled as he and his pet went on with their walk.
“You like dogs?” Allen asked.
“To be honest, I love them. Dogs are such wonderful creatures. They love you no matter what. That’s hard to find.”
“Let me get a cab.” There were none in sight. While they waited at the curb, a policeman began to cross the street and headed toward them. Allen shoved his hand into his pockets and quietly asked, “Would you take my arm?”
Mel did not realize what was happening but did what he had asked. It was then that she noticed the officer. Mel laid her head on his shoulder and focused her gaze on a couple window shopping across the street. Once he had passed, she removed her arm from his. “I hate that fucking shit,” she hissed. Allen looked down at her face. Her eyes were blazing. He waved down an approaching cab, and they piled in.
“You can’t let it get to you,” he said in a matter-of fact kind of way. He turned his attention to the cabbie and said, “West Central Park and 69th.” This time, she accepted when he offered a cigarette.
Pulling her hair back, she leaned into the lighter’s flame. She sighed. “I’m not able to pay for anything, and it’s driving me nuts. I’m embarrassed,” and sighed again. “As soon as I…”
“Later, OK?” he asked and patted her hand.
She could not help but look up at all the high-reaching buildings that stood in Manhattan. “I can never get over just how immense this place is.” Her head was just about upside down, trying to get the best possible view.
“Yes. You are adorable.” She didn’t hear him. The city and all its energy had her full attention. Allen turned to the gorgeous driver. When they arrived at his address, the cabbie thanked Allen for the tip. He also handed him a slip of paper with his name and number on it.
Allen just smiled and put it in his pocket.
A uniformed doorman held open the heavy glass door. “Good afternoon, Mr. Shandi.”
“Hey there, George. How are Christina and the baby?”
“They are wonderful, thanks for asking.”
“Come on. You must have a picture, yes?”
With that, George pulled his wallet out of his pocket and opened it to a photo.
“Oh,” Allen said with a sigh. “Oh my gosh. They are lovely. Is Penelope about four months old now? Look at these beautiful women, Mel.”
She took the wallet. The woman in the photo looked thrilled to be a mom. Little Penelope’s toothless grin was precious. “You are a very lucky man,” she said placing her hand on her abdomen. Still smiling, she handed it back to him.
“Yes, I am.” George took a few seconds to look at the picture before putting it away.
“By the way, Christopher has taken Daphne for a walk.”
Allen gave him a wink. “Thanks, George.”
The elevator required a unique key to go to the penthouse. Mel and Allen rode it nine floors up. When the elevator doors opened, they stepped into a small area with a large door across the way. He opened it and they entered an extravagant vestibule. Mel had never seen or could even imagine such wealth. An older gentleman greeted Allen with his mail and messages.
He looked inquisitively at Melanie.
Allen said, “This is my sweet friend, Melanie. Mel, this is Quinten. If you need or want anything, this is your man.”
Mel extended her hand out to Quinten and said, “Nice to meet you.” He hesitated and looked at Allen. Allen grinned.
He took her hand and said, “It’s very nice to meet you. Would you prefer Mel or Melanie?”
“Either is fine. May I use the bathroom?”
“Of course, follow me, please.”
The bathroom was straight ahead and to the right. It was below a winding staircase with full bookshelves. Quinten lightly pressed the spine of a red and black book, and a door opened outward. Orange-yellow light spilled out onto the tiled floor.
“I’ve never actually seen a secret door. Very cool! Thank you,” she said and went inside. The dominant color was red, and the accent colors were black, gold and purple. Tiles of red with gold swirls outlined in black covered the bottom half of the walls. The upper half was crimson. She was sure the entire room was larger than her apartment. There were several black and red velvet ottomans and a purple and gold chaise lounge in a sitting area. On the other side of a half wall was the toilet and a bidet alongside it. Over the double sinks hung an enormous mirror with an ornate frame. She set her bag on the black marble counter between the sinks. As she sat on the toilet, she tried to take all of it in. “And this is just the bathroom,” she whispered. Once she’d finished, she washed her hands and raked her fingers through her hair.
Allen was waiting for her. “I’d like to show you something.” They went up the stairs and off to the left. After passing several rooms, Allen held open the door to a bedroom. She flashed him a confused expression.
“Oh! No. This isn’t one of those ‘I’d like to show you my etchings’ snares. I wanted to show you a few things from my collection. It’s through the doorway on the left.”
She did not budge. “Wait here,” he said and disappeared into that room. As he came back, he draped pieces of clothing on hangers across the bed. Spreading them out, he chose a backless sequin-covered halter top jumpsuit in champagne gold. “Isn’t this scrumptious?”
“It’s dazzling. But it’s not my style.”
He looked at the remainder of what was on the bed. “That’s the second time you’ve mentioned your style. What is your style, exactly?”
“I like a less feminine look, you know? I’ve always been a tomboy,” she said timidly. “Do you design things for men?”
The sound of quickly clicking toenails on the wood floor grew louder. With that, a magnificent Rottweiler burst into the room. “Daphne-love!” gushed Allen.
Catching his breath, Christopher followed. He stood over six feet tall, blonde hair parted on the right and trimmed with precision. Although he was slender, he was muscular the way 20-year-old men often are. “I’m back from our daily tug. She is going to pull my arm out one of these days,” he said.
Daphne’s interest shifted to the new scent in the room. Her full tail swished back and forth as she sniffed Mel’s feet and legs.
“Who is this?” Christopher asked, inspecting Mel.
She stuck out her hand, “I’m Mel Foster.” He hesitated for a moment, then took her hand. “It’s very nice to meet you,” she said. Still looking at Christopher, she asked, “Daphne’s tail is intact? I don’t think I’ve ever seen that. She’s a beauty.”
“We got her when she was a pup, and we specifically told them not to do that. It’s unthinkable,” Allen huffed.
Mel was on her knees, along with Christopher, cuddling and scratching her belly. “We had a large dog when I was little. Just a mutt, but at least 100 pounds. My father found a harness for her and it helped when we had to walk her.” Daphne jumped onto Mel knocking her back with her legs folded under her and began licking her face. Mel laughed and hugged her around the neck.
“Daphne!” Allen laughed. “Come! Come here, my girl.” She obediently went to his side.
“May I have a washcloth or something?” Mel asked once Allen had lured Daphne away.
Christopher answered, “Sure.” Mel followed him out of the bedroom and down the hall.
“Second door on the left,” he said with a forced smile.
She pushed the door, but it did not close all the way. Splashing her face with warm soap and water removed the drool from her face. Two black velvet ottomans placed side by side with a tiny table between were in the corner. She sat and took advantage of the small, crystal ashtray. Digging through her bag, she retrieved her last cigarette, matches and a hair clip. Taking a deep drag, she grabbed everything and went to the mirror. With the cigarette hanging from her mouth, she pulled her thick hair and piled it on the crown of her head. The extra-large leather slide barely fit over her mop of curls. She pushed the stick through the holes to secure everything in place. Invariably, five or six tendrils hung down around her neck, dripping down over her back and shoulders. She could hear a discussion growing louder coming from the bedroom. “She will end up becoming just another fag-hag for you. What is this, the fifth? I do not need yet another person hanging around watching us as if you and I were a freakshow,” Christopher said firmly.
“You are wrong about her. She’s one of us. Her ideas about women’s clothing are perfect for what’s down the road,” said Allen.
“Is that how you met her?” There was a pause.
Trying to make her presence known, Mel tugged the door open and stomped heavily onto the floor. Daphne flounced toward her. “I’m going to have to get going, little girl.” Holding either side of her enormous head, she kissed her loudly.
“Your hair. I love it!” declared Allen. “I have a proposal for you, Mel. You brought up a more masculine feel for women’s clothing. Would you help me bring that idea to life?” Allen asked.
“I don’t know the first thing about fashion.”
Christopher laughed, “You’ve got that right.”
“Now, now. Let’s not be bitchy,” said Allen.
Mel motioned toward Christopher while looking at Allen and said, “He understands that I do not…”
“Sometimes, all you need to know is what you like and what you don’t like,” said Allen. “Like art.” He grabbed her hand and led her to the back of the bedroom. After opening the double-door walk-in closet, he began to look through his clothes. He chose a white button-down shirt from his closet. “What would you do with this?” He held it out to her. His right arm was across his chest and was clutching his left bicep. His forearm extended outward with the palm of his hand facing the ceiling, and the shirt dangled from his fingertip. She would come to know this as his “What say you?” pose.
“Seriously?” She exhaled. Taking the shirt from him, she hung it from an indentation on one of the columns of the four-poster bed. Christopher gasped at the thought of damage done to the tiger maple column. “I would make it sleeveless and shorten the front to waist length.” She turned it around. Christopher stepped in and held it for her. “Thanks, Christopher. It could be darted a bit to fit my form, then lengthened the shirttail to fall just passed the…” she patted her rear.
“Ass?” Christopher asked. Allen gave him a look.
“Well, I was gonna say cheeks, but either fit. Split it up the middle to about two inches below the waistline. It would end up kind of like tails on a tux. If you could give it lapels rather than a collar, I think that would be something I’d like.”
“What would you wear with it?” asked Allen.
Taking a moment to think, she finally said, “I would wear straight leg jeans and man boots up to my knees. You know, the kind that you tie up in the front without the spiky heels.”
Allen looked over at Christopher and said, “Do you see what I mean?”
“Do you design clothes also, Christopher?”
He seemed insulted by the question. “I am a model,” he answered in a sharp tone.
“I’m sorry. I don’t read many magazines.” Pointing out her appearance with gesturing hands, she laughed, “Just look at me for crying out loud!”
“I have to give you that,” Christopher said.
“Honey, that’s not…” Allen started to say.
“But it’s funny and appropriate,” answered Mel. “Allen, thanks for all of this. I’ve got to get going.”
A nearly palpable look went from Allen to Christopher. Christopher shrugged his shoulders and said, “OK,” and he left the room.
“This might be forward, but I…we wondered if you would consider staying with us while we take Cleo in this new direction? This place has several empty rooms. But I think you’d truly love the one on the far end.”
“But I haven’t agreed to the clothing thing.”
He ignored her. She followed him to an enormous room down the hallway. Daphne’s toenails let them know she was right behind them. Everything was covered with sheets except the king-size bed. Sliding glass doors on the far side of the room led to a balcony complete with greenery and furniture. The walls were white, and the furniture was in varying shades of red. As the sun fell low in the sky, it cast a fantastic orangey-pink over everything around her, including Allen.
“Isn’t it gorgeous?”
“Yes, but I have a job,” she said.
He came toward her and held her by the shoulders. “This is an opportunity to grow. It will be your job. Name your price.” She was only aware of his hands on her. Everything else was a blur. “Please?” he asked, batting his eyes again. Allen bent down a bit to meet her eye and was inches from her face. “I need you.”
She paused, then finally said, “Yes. Thank you. Allen, I am so grateful…” but the lump in her throat and tears squelched her ability to speak.
Allen threw his arms around her and she pulled away just a bit. He laughed and said, “I’m sorry. I excite easily!”
“Good to know,” she said, patting him on the back. He laughed into her ear. The sensation of his breath on her neck was incredible and alarming at once. “I have one request.”
“Name it.”
She pulled back and placed her hands on his chest. “I am not a huggee, cuddly, touchy-feely person. Please, don’t take it the wrong way. You are such a great guy, a real gentleman. You would never deliberately hurt anyone. It just makes me uncomfortable.”
He looked into her eyes. “Of course, I can respect that.” He backed away. “I understand, you know. Maybe better than most. I was different, too.” She felt light-headed.
“Are you alright?” he asked.
“Yes. I think I need a shower and a good night’s sleep.”
“Can I have Quinten bring you a bite to eat?”
“No, not right now. If I get hungry, I’ll poke around the kitchen, if that’s OK.”
“It’s fine with me, but Quinten gets a bit touchy when his domain is disturbed.”
“I promise I’ll clean up after myself,” she offered.
“Good Lord, woman, I was joking! Feel free to have anything you’d like.” He left her room and closed the door behind him.
Chapter 3
By the next morning, all of Mel’s belongings had been picked up and delivered to the penthouse. That afternoon, Allen purchased a month’s worth of clothing for her right down to her panties, along with a carton of her favorite cigarettes plus several joints. She sat on the edge of the bed surrounded by all of it, including the jelly jar she’d given to Fred and her prized possession. It was an old lockbox. Taking the key out of her bag, she placed the box on her lap and opened it slowly. Lifting the three photographs of her brother, Benjamin, from inside, she traced his face with her finger. It also contained a spool of fishing line. She looked up to see Allen standing in the doorway. She closed the box and set it aside.
“Would you like a hand putting things away?” he asked.
“I can’t accept all of this.”
“Consider it an advance,” he said. “Anything you dislike will be returned, exchanged, whatever.” He walked toward her.
Mel stood and moved toward the middle of the room. “You could have let my friend keep the glass,” she remarked.
“I did something a little better, I think. I hope you agree. Fred now occupies your old apartment, and I’ve paid up for two years. He has several new outfits, a bit of cash, and will be filling in at your old job until you decide what you want to do. I will find another place for you to live if you think this isn’t working out, but I want you to share your ideas with me,” he said in a serious tone.
She turned away from him. “I’m going to do my very best for you. Thank you for giving me this chance.”
He moved toward her, then thought better of it. Quinten knocked on the door frame.
“Excuse me, Sir. How many for dinner tonight?”
“Six, I think. Very casual, OK?” Allen asked.
“Time?”
“Six-thirty.”
“Is there anything, in particular, you would like tonight, Sir?”
“Mel, if you sat down in a restaurant and could have anything you wanted, what would it be?” Allen asked her.
She chuckled. “I feel as if I’m in a dream, or I’m high. Maybe I’ve died and gone to Heaven.” She asked timidly, “Do you like spaghetti and meatballs and maybe a salad?”
“Perfect. Is that doable, Quinten?”
“Of course, Sir. Can I get you anything in the meantime, Miss Melanie?”
“No thanks, and for God’s sake, drop the Miss. You make me feel as if I’m the character in ‘Gone with the Wind’! Or worse, my mother.”
“Quinten, could you give us a minute?”
“Of course,” he said and went downstairs.
Allen sat on the bench at the foot of the bed. His legs crossed at the knee and leaning back on his hands. “Did I tell you how I ended up living here?” he asked Mel. She shook her head, no. He gestured with his hand for her to sit next to him. She sat beside him with her legs apart, her elbows resting on her thighs and hands folded. He brushed her hair over her shoulder.
“I just want to see your face, OK?”
“Yes,” she answered and looked at him.
“My father owned an oil conglomerate. It doesn’t matter which one. They are all greed-factories. He could buy and sell God, or so he said. The best part is that God got the last laugh. One morning he told his secretary that there were to be no phone calls, no interruptions. He had a massive heart attack at his desk while she typed away just outside his door. Side note, she was also his mistress. An hour and a half later, she poked her head in to ask a question. She found him sweat-soaked and face down in a pool of his vomit. The Man upstairs is a funny guy, don’t you agree?”
“I gather you were not close to him?”
“No one was. My father loved money and fucking women. If he could have figured out a way to bang them with a roll of hundreds on his cock, it would have been his ejaculation of a lifetime.”
“Wow,” she chuckled. “How did your mom take it?”
“Poor thing, she loved him and not for his money. She would tell me about the 19-year-old boy she’d met all those years ago. Generous, kind, hardworking and very gentle with her. Somewhere along the line, he soured. He began drinking to excess and worse, hitting her. He became ruthless.”
“Did he know you are gay?”
“I think if he’d spent just a bit of time with me, he would have. But you must be in the same room with a person, look into their eyes, listen to what they say to learn anything. My wonderful mother died two years after my father. Countless homes, cars, all kinds of ‘things’ had become the property of my brother and me. Did I tell you I have a brother? Keith. Funny guy. A good man. Anyway. He and I sold most of it and gave the money to charities for the homeless, hospitals, but the best was handing out money to anyone that looked like they could use it. We knew this would make the old bastard roll in his grave. Even better, we made the donations in his name.”
“Ooooh, you scoundrels. I love it,” she laughed.
“Quinten has been with our family since before I was born. He is an old-fashioned gentleman’s gentleman. He just can’t help himself. I know for certain there were times that he would intercept when that bastard was after my mom. He’d lie and say there was a phone call or news on TV about my father’s company. My father was so drunk he probably could have distracted him with a ring of keys, …like an infant. All that being said, Quinten is who he is, and we accept him that way. Alright?”
Her face was beet red. “Yes. Understood. I’ll make it right.” She looked back on the bed and asked, “I hate to sound like such a girl, but what are you wearing tonight?”
Allen laughed. “How do jeans and a shirt sound? Shoes are optional.”
“Comfortable, thank you.”
Allen’s chef, Wyatt Edmonds, had taken the time to ask Mel about her selection for dinner, right down to the amount of garlic or basil. He stood at six foot four and two hundred forty pounds of muscle. He looked extremely intimidating, but that turned out to be completely wrong. He was a gentle and soft-spoken man. It was moving to see his interest in what would make her happy.
That evening, softly playing jazz hung in the background. Allen and Christopher were in one of two black loveseats in a cozy area of the living room. The other loveseat was directly across from them, with two red high-back chairs between them facing the fireplace. A black lacquered coffee table sat between it all.
The first to arrive were two women that worked in the garment district. Eric had red cropped hair and was wearing a man’s blue button-down shirt tucked into her black jeans with a matching blue belt and sneakers.
Mel asked Eric, “May I ask, do you consider yourself a ‘he’ or ‘she’?”
“He, and thank you for asking.” His girlfriend, Meghan also had red hair, but shoulder length. She wore a short denim skirt, a red sweater and black high heels. After the introductions, Allen offered drinks. Eric would have his usual Pabst Blue Ribbon beer in a pint glass while Meghan preferred white wine. Rather than help, Christopher called out for a vodka and tonic. As Allen gave Eric and Meghan their drinks, he heard the elevator door open and excused himself. Mel went to the bar to make Christopher’s drink. She brought it to him and asked, “What do you think Allen will have?”
“I have no idea,” he answered, not meeting her eyes.
“Mel, meet Zora Preston. She is a buyer for one of the high-end stores on 5th Avenue. Zora, Mel Foster.”
She was a tall, curvy African American woman with a beautiful, giant Afro. She wore a tight-fitting, sleeveless black turtleneck sweater, large gold hoop earrings and a floor-length striped skirt in all the colors of the rainbow. Mel smiled and shook her hand. “Do you prefer Mel or Melanie?” Zora asked in a soft and sexy voice.
“Either is fine.”
“Then, Melanie, it is.”
“Your hair is gorgeous!” Mel gushed.
“As is yours,” she responded, taking a handful and twirling it between her fingers.
“I told her just how beautiful you are, Mel. And did I lie?” Allen asked, holding his hands to her like the statuesque women on game shows would when displaying a new car.
Mel became an entirely new shade of red. “Allen, please.” She laughed and turned to Zora. “If you know Allen at all, then you know how generous he is with his compliments. Zora, what can I get you to drink?”
“I’ll have whatever you’re having,” she smiled, putting her hand on top of Mel’s. The sound of ice cubes clinking together came from Christopher. He’d raised his glass and shook it. Allen snatched it from his hand, then he and Mel went to the bar.
“What’s going on, Allen?”
“I’m sorry for Christopher’s behavior.”
“That’s not what I meant. Why is Zora here?”
“I thought the two of you might hit it off,” he said innocently.
“Oh, good Christ,” she said, leaning on the marble surface. She closed her eyes and said, “Are you under the impression that I am a lesbian?”
“Well, yes.”
“Oh, my God,” she whispered, then laughed. “I can’t be upset with you. A tomboy is a stone’s throw from that. No, I’m not a lesbian. This beautiful woman was brought here as my date?”
“I am so sorry,” he said, thoroughly embarrassed. “Let me talk to Zora.”
“No. That’s OK. Let me,” Mel said. After handing Christopher his drink, she asked, “Zora, would you mind checking out the wine selections?”
“Not at all.”
Allen watched out of the corner of his eye as Mel placed her hand on Zora’s back. Mel smiled at her and spoke softly. A look of confusion came across Zora’s face as Mel spoke but quickly changed to a warm smile. Zora placed her hand on Mel’s. She kissed her on the forehead and, with her thumb, wiped the lipstick it left behind. Their attention turned to the wine. Mel laughed loudly at something Zora said. Christopher smirked at Mel. “Idiot,” he said under his breath. Allen shot him a look.
The evening continued as if nothing had happened. The dining room table was set, complete with two flower arrangements. Allen and Christopher sat at opposite ends of the table. Eric and Meghan sat on one side and Mel and Zora on the other.
Mel asked Eric, “How long have you two been together?”
Eric lifted Meghan’s hand from under the table and kissed it. “Two years. The first time I saw Meghan, I was hooked. I couldn’t take my eyes off her. Then she turned and looked at me and smiled. I couldn’t believe it. Everything came into focus. People say things like the sky is bluer, the birds sing more sweetly, and that is the truth. She was just what I needed in my life,” Eric said and leaned in for a kiss.

PART ONE — HER STYLE
Chapter 1—September 6th, 1972
The night breeze was a welcome sensation after spending six hours working up a sweat cleaning one of the NYU buildings off Washington Square. This seedy side of town always put Melanie on edge. The drenched bandana covering her hair would stay in place until she was safely back in her room. Reaching into her purple bag, she found her keys. Before putting one foot on the sidewalk, she made sure the keys were spread apart and protruding between her fingers.
The walk to the Village Plaza Hotel took as long as smoking one cigarette, three quarters if she was nervous. Three drags in, she heard a low, angry voice. A lighter voice responded as if confused. In the darkness of a doorway off to the left, Melanie could make out a large man hanging over a smaller person.
“Faggot, yer gonna get yer fuckin’ ass kicked,” he growled while raising his massive fist back over his shoulder. It was then that Mel realized the smaller person was a man trying to cover his head with his hands.
Quickly, she stepped toward them. “Honey, where have you been?” she asked, pulling the bandana off her head. The growler, still clenching his fist, turned to look at her. For just a few seconds, he stared at her. Her dirty bell-bottoms and loosely fitting t-shirt covering her slender body did not distract him from the long, curly-cue, strawberry blonde hair that framed her beautiful face and fell to her elbows. With one hand on her hip, she flicked the cigarette to the side. For a fleeting moment, the only sounds were a few crickets communicating with each other. She took that time to smile and step toward him. When she was close enough to see him begin to smile back, her right arm swung around, connecting with his left cheek and eye. The punch itself was not remarkable, but the keys split his face and it had begun to bleed. He lost his balance just enough to allow her to finish the job by kneeing him in the groin. He yelped in pain as he fell over, clutching his crotch. Placing her arm under the light voiced man’s arm, she brought him to his feet.
All he could do was stare at her. Not for her hair and sweet face, but because he was dumbstruck. He’d seen only one other woman fight like that.
Grabbing his hand, they ran down Washington Place. Twice, she looked back to see if the beast was behind them. Tugging him to the right, they ran into the hotel. The man behind the desk in the lobby yelled, “Where are you going?”
“It’s me, Melanie, Mr. Jones.” The three flights of stairs took the last of her energy. Looking back over her shoulder, she felt a little safer. She had not let go of his hand. At times, he’d run right beside her, others ahead of her. They stopped on the third floor. She let go of him and bent over, hands on her knees, trying to catch her breath. With a sweeping motion, she tossed her hair back and stood upright. In front of her darkened doorway, she finally looked over at him. Once her eyes adjusted to the light, she saw his face. In the shadows of a dimly lit bare bulb screwed into the ceiling, she could see his smile. He leaned against the wall with his hand shaking against his chest.
“You’ll be OK,” she tried to say in a calm voice.
His long, dark brown, shiny hair fell in layers just below his shoulders. A pair of Aviator prescription glasses rested on his significant and masculine nose. Eyeliner enhanced his almond-shaped brown eyes and long lashes. Her eyes fell to his mouth, and she couldn’t help but stare at his lips. They were the kind that made women jealous. Both the top and bottom were full. The deep dimples were like perpetual parentheses on the edges of that extraordinary mouth. Once he stood up straight, Melanie guessed he was only a few inches taller than her, putting him at about 5’11”. A bead of blood rolled down over his eyelid.
“Looks like he got a punch in.” She handed him a tissue from her bag, put her blood-covered door key in the worn lock and opened it. He followed her inside.
The kitchen was no more than an area in the otherwise Lilliputian room. She pulled the only chair from the tiny table and motioned for him to sit.
“What’s your name?” she asked as she rinsed off her keys.
“Allen. Shandi.”
She smiled. “Like the beer?”
“No,” he smiled, “as in boisterous.” He looked around the room. It was shabby but clean. Not like anything he’d ever experienced. “And what is your name? I heard you say, ‘Melanie.’”
“Yeah. Melanie. Mel. Foster.”
“As in cultivate?”
“Nah. Like the Grant’s.”
His laugh was light and feminine. Mel pulled a small container from under the twin bed and put it on the threadbare rug next to him. Inside was an assortment of necessities. It contained a sewing needle stuck in a spool of white thread, a hammer, a box of band-aids, a roll of tape, and a small glass container of hydrogen peroxide. She retrieved a band-aid and the bottle.
“Would you take off your glasses, please?”
“Truth be told, my vision is horrible. I can only see about a foot in front of me without them,” he told her.
“I’d like to clean out that cut. That bastard was filthy. It wouldn’t surprise me if you caught something just by breathing in the same space as that creep did. Your glasses could use a wipe, too.” He removed them and tilted his head towards her. “This might sting a bit,” Mel warned. She lifted his thick hair away from his forehead. The aroma of pot and sandalwood floated up to her and it made her smile. She lightly patted his head with a paper towel with the tiniest bit of hydrogen peroxide.
“Jesus!” He winced.
“I’m sorry,” she said, and blew on the cut.
“I haven’t thanked you for saving me from that Neanderthal. What would ever make you go after something that size?”
She paused. “The ‘f’ word.”
“Fuck?”
“Faggot.” The very word made her purse her lips. “May I have your glasses?” She took them, gave them a quick cleaning on her shirt, and held them out to him.
He reached for her hand holding the paper towel, but she quickly pulled away. He was startled by her reaction. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean anything by it,” he said. “I should go. Thank you for your care and time.” He put his glasses back on, then got up and walked to the door.
She was still holding the bloodied paper towel as he closed the door behind him. Her head fell back. “Oh, good Christ,” she said, disappointed in herself. “Let it go!” she whispered.
Once she’d quickly washed the dirty coffee cup from that morning and rinsed herself off in front of the sink, she fell onto the bed. The sounds of New York City outside her window had finally become familiar to her. That was not what kept her from relaxing. The image of his face kept returning to her. Allen was beautiful. He’s gay. She punched her pillow in hopes of making it more comfortable and closed her eyes. Tomorrow is Saturday. She began a mental list of things to do. Things like laundry and groceries and such needed to be done. But then, she heard his laugh in her head. Her eyes opened, and she sighed. There will not be much in the way of sleep tonight. “Happy birthday to me,” she whispered.
Chapter 2
It was nearly noon when she opened her eyes. A light knock on the door startled her. She jumped out of bed and put on her robe.
“Who’s there?”
“I have a delivery for Miss Grant,” a deep voice said.
“Miss Grant?” she whispered, and then it clicked. “Hold on.” Grabbing her bag off the floor, she searched inside until she found a quarter at the bottom. Pulling the door open just a crack, she could see an enormous assortment of purple and white flowers. She opened it wide enough to take them. Slowly, the bouquet lowered, and Allen’s eyes came into view. He playfully batted them at her.
She laughed. “What’s this?”
“It’s just a modest gift in appreciation of your bravery. Also…” He handed her a large, beautifully wrapped box. She took it from him.
“Come on in, please. You didn’t have to do this.”
He placed the flowers on the tiny table, then turned to her. After adjusting his glasses against his nose, Allen stood with his hands behind his back. His skin-tight, shiny black jeans flared out into a modest bell. The shoes looked like women’s leather square-toed chunky-heeled pumps, but he made them look great. The tan tank top was sheer enough that the hair on his chest and the outline of his nipples were evident. Around his neck he wore a slender black leather tie that was loosened and hung low on his chest. The knot itself was strange. A black silk scarf was wrapped several times around his left wrist and tied, leaving the ends hanging about six inches.
She sat on the bed, pulled off the wrapping, and lifted the lid. Inside was a proper first aid kit, a sewing kit complete with scissors, and a few smaller tools complete with two kinds of screwdrivers, a tape measure, pliers and an adjustable wrench.
“This is too much!”
He sat near her and took out an ‘L’ shaped piece of metal and examined it. “What is this?”
“It’s an Allen wrench,” she laughed. His smile disappeared, and he placed it back in the box. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to….” Tentatively, she patted his shoulder and rose from the bed. “Would you like a cup of coffee? All I have is instant.” She clutched her robe at the neck and started to open one of the two cabinets.
“I was hoping I could take you out for a bite. It’s a lovely day. We could walk a bit if you’d like.” Mel did not answer. “We could take a cab if you prefer.”
“I…I don’t have any clean clothes. Today is laundry day for me. Can I take a raincheck?” she finally asked, not meeting his eye as her face reddened.
“Well, this is all too perfect! How long will it take for you to put on whatever you would have worn to the laundromat? In 15 minutes, I’ll have a cab out front, alright?”
“I don’t…”
“Please?” He held out his hand. She looked down, smiled and swatted her fingertips with his.
“Alright, then. Meet me outside in fifteen minutes,” Allen said with a smile. Just before he closed the door, he looked back at her, flashed that incredible smile again, and gave a quick nod in a way that somehow relaxed any of her suspicious feelings.
She lifted a pair of hip huggers from the top of a pile of clothes in her closet and shook them out. Her only clean shirt was a lilac sleeveless turtleneck her brother made for her. She brushed her teeth with one hand and ran her fingers through her thick hair with the other. Laying out two pieces of bread on the counter, she assembled a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. She rinsed out the paper coffee cup she’d saved from the day before and filled it with milk. The lid still fit. There were far too many beautiful flowers in her bouquet not to share. She chose three cosmoses, cut the stems, and set them in a little water-filled jelly jar. Splashing water on her face, she looked at her reflection in the aged mirror on the wall. As ready as I’ll ever be. Taking a deep breath, Melanie slung her bag over her shoulder. She tried to walk calmly down the three flights of stairs.
Through the dirty front door window, she could see Allen leaning on a cab, chatting with the driver. Just then, a tall blonde man walked by them. Both heads swiveled, taking a long look at his ass. She had to chuckle.
“I’d check that out myself,” she whispered.
The day was quite a bit cooler than the day before. Allen took a cigarette from his pocket, along with a gold lighter. As he lit up, he saw Melanie walking toward him. She turned to the homeless man sitting up against the building. “Fred, here’s a little something to eat. Would you save me the glass?” He reached out for the paper bag and cup. With his free hand, he took hers and kissed it. Mumbling something unintelligible to her, she smiled and gave him the flowers.
He placed them up against his leg, cupped his hand around the glass and admired his gift.
A breeze drifted down the street. Melanie’s nipples shriveled from the cold air. Her knee-jerk reaction was to draw her arms up to her chest. Allen noticed and immediately felt embarrassed for her.
A policeman walked by them and stopped to observe Allen. He grabbed Mel’s hand, opened the door to the cab, and helped her in. Walking to the other side, Allen kept an eye on him. He tipped an imaginary cap to the officer and climbed inside. “Broome and Mercer,” he directed and turned to her. “You are adorable!” he said, smiling at Mel. The cabbie stared at him through the rearview mirror.
“Where were you coming from last night?” he asked her.
“My job. I didn’t ask you how your head is.”
He smiled. “It’s fine. Where do you work?”
“In the evenings, I clean some of the buildings at NYU.” She lifted his hair away from the cut. Clicking her tongue at the sight of the half dollar sized bruise developing, she asked, “Did you ice this?”
“No. How old are you?”
“20. And you?”
“24. Where are you from originally?”
“Upstate New York. A tiny town no one’s ever heard of.”
“Is that where you learned to fight?” he asked with a smile.
The color seemed to drain from her face. A silence hung between them until the cab hit a pothole that sent them both leaning hard to the right. She caught Allen as he fell against her.
Her loud, nervous laugh made its debut, and it certainly could draw attention.
“Oh my! Well, I love that sound!” he said.
The cab pulled over and made a hard stop. “Broome and Mercer, Mr. Shandi.” Allen’s tight pants forced him to lean to the left awkwardly. Jamming his right hand in his front pocket, he retrieved a bundle of bills. Mel glanced down at his hands. The bulge to the left of the bottom of his zipper caught her off guard. She very quickly looked away. He gave the cabbie a $5 tip.
“Thank you, Mr. Shandi!” His hand began to tremble as he put his money away. She took notice, and he caught that. He exited, went to her side of the cab and opened the door. Offering her his left hand, he helped her climb out.
“Are you hungry? I’m hungry. Let’s get lunch. My treat,” he said, looking across the street. He grabbed her hand and they sprinted through the traffic. Horns began honking, and a few cars stopped short. He held his hand up in a thanks gesture. She loved the way his hair bounced as he trotted. They entered a narrow eatery. A decidedly gay man welcomed Allen.
“Mr. Shandi, it’s so good to see you again. Your table is ready.” Other couples that had been waiting were not regulars or did not carry the same weight as Allen. She did not know what to make of this.
They were seated across from one another in a dark and quiet corner. Paper menus were brought to the table by a pretty young lady. “What can I get you to drink, Mr. Shandi?” she asked in a coquettish manner. She reached past Melanie’s face to light the candle and replaced the dirty ashtray with a clean one.
“What would you like, Mel?”
No one had called her that in at least five years.
“Coffee please, with milk?” she asked, looking at the waitress.
“I’ll have the same.”
The waitress placed her hand on his shoulder and said, “You’ve got it, Honey.” She walked away with quite a sway in her hips. Mel grinned and looked over to see Allen reaching for her over the table. He took a lock of her curly hair and rolled it between his fingers.
“If mermaids were real, this is the kind of hair they would have.”
She laughed as her face turned red. “Wow. I’ve never heard that before.” The art that was curiously placed up against the wall caught her eye. One piece in particular stood out. “Take a peek at that one! It’s a kaleidoscope!” She turned her attention back to his face. He’d been staring at her. Feeling embarrassed, she pretended to go over the menu. “Where are you from?” Mel asked.
“I’m not an interesting person,” he said while lighting a cigarette. “Would you like one?” he offered.
“No, thanks. I don’t want to hear your deepest, darkest secrets. How about, what do you do for a living? I feel like I’m the only one not in on it. Everybody knows you. I’ve lived here for five months, and I have no idea what you do or why you are so,” she paused, “beloved.”
“Beloved. That’s interesting.” He propped up his elbow on the table, and he rested his chin in his hand. The smoke from his cigarette curled up around his face. She sat back in the chair and crossed her ankle over her knee. Lacing her fingers together, she rested her hands in her lap. Giving him an “I’ve got all day” look, she took a deep breath.
Tapping his cigarette on the ashtray, he asked, “Have you ever heard of a clothing line called ‘Cleo’?”
“Yes. Do you work for her?”
“Well, I am her, so to speak. I named it after a knot I created for a necktie.” He pointed to the one that hung from his neck. It almost appeared to be a braid, and yet it was not. “The business has been open for three and a half years. It was perfect timing for my vision of what young women wanted. And the rest as they say…” he laughed, waving his cigarette in the air.
The waitress returned with the coffee. “Have you decided what you’d like to eat?” she asked, staring directly at Allen.
“Not really. Can we have a few more minutes?”
“Sure, Honey,” she answered and sashayed away, stopping once to look over her shoulder at Allen. But his thoughts were elsewhere.
“Have you always known you were…a visionary?” Mel asked as she stirred her coffee.
Allen glanced around to see if anyone was within earshot. He whispered, “What exactly are you asking?”
“My brother made this top for me. Not really my style, but he made it with love.” She gently touched the gauzy fabric around her neck. “Ben knew he was gay from the time he was a little boy,” Mel said softly. Her eyes welled up. “My mother simply ignored that fact. My father had an altogether different take on Ben. The things he would punish him for, well, it would just break your heart. That bastard took off in 1965. Good riddance.”
“Where is Ben now?”
“Buried in the Oswegatchie Cemetery outside of Fine, NY. Fine, NY! Funny, huh?” she laughed to cover the sadness.
More customers had begun to fill the place. The waitress returned once more. “What will it be?” she asked.
“Mel?” he asked.
She kept her head down and asked, “May I have a burger?” A tear rolled down her nose and fell on the menu.
“I’ll have the same,” he said. The waitress jotted it down as she walked away.
He gave Mel his napkin. “Dry your eyes, Sweetness,” then moved to a chair next to her and put his arm around her shoulders. “There are souls that are just too beautiful for this world,” he whispered in her ear. She had thought the very same thing a thousand times.
Two gay teens cautiously approached the table. Mel looked up. “Your fans, Mr. S! If you’ll excuse me…” The young men nearly levitated over a chance to chat with Allen. He watched her walk through a narrow doorway and into the restroom.
Splashing a little water on her face, she looked at her reflection. Her hands gripped the sides of the sink. “Pull it together,” she whispered to herself. Once she’d collected herself with a few deep breaths, she headed back to the table. She stopped and watched Allen as he spoke to them. He listened carefully as they replied and talked about their dreams.
Allen was leaning forward, elbows on his knees and speaking softly. He was incredibly patient as he explained what it took to get where he was. His enormous smile was evidence that he seemed to enjoy this part of his celebrity.
She leaned against the door frame, legs crossed at the ankles, her arms crossed just below her chest.
The two teens stood close to each other. For a second, their pinkies hooked together. Allen grinned. Removing the scarf from his wrist, he tied it around the wrist of the young man on the left, then lifted the tie from his neck and put it on the other fan. He held out his hand to shake theirs.
An older couple seated at a nearby table shook their heads in disapproval. Mel stood and stared at them for a moment, then turned her back and obstructed their view. The boys practically pogoed over to her.
“Johnny, isn’t he amazing?” the shorter of the two asked his boyfriend.
He grinned at Mel and said, “He’s amazing!”
“He certainly is,” she replied. The boys left overwhelmed with joy about what had just happened.
The burgers arrived at the table as Mel sat back down. “Thank you,” she said to the waitress and tried to make eye contact.
Finally, she looked at Mel and said, “You’re welcome.”
“Those kids will be living on that for a long time. That’s just about the sweetest thing I have ever seen,” she told him.
“I could say that about what you did for the guy sitting in front of your building earlier, but I won’t. Mine was sweeter.”
Her laugh reached the customers near the front door. “Sorry,” she said, covering her mouth, trying to muffle the sound. “You are a brat!”
“The boys’ names are Jon and Johnny. Isn’t that sweet? They’re hoping to open a clothing store in the village.” As he set his coffee cup on the saucer, his hand trembled again, rattling both. “Don’t ever apologize for your laugh. I like people that let their emotions out. I’d hate to think what would happen if you tried to hold that inside. It could be catastrophic! Your eyes and brain would be scattered everywhere!” he nearly shrilled, while his hand swiped through the air as if he were carrying a tray of filled coffee cups.
She was about to ask him about his hand, but he stood, excused himself, and headed toward the restroom. His hand, his life. It was quite simply none of her business.
When he returned, they continued to talk for another hour or so. Allen had participated in the Stonewall riots and Mel wanted to learn about every scrap of it.
“I witnessed the woman, Storme DeLarverie, fighting the cops. Some aren’t sure it was her, but I’m convinced it was. When she yelled out to us, ‘Why don’t you guys do something?’ we all went crazy. I guess we all have a boiling point.”
“Truer words, my friend. Ben wanted so much to be a part of it. He never hid who he was. All he ever wanted was to work for, well, someone exactly like you. Damn, you would have loved him,” she said, leaning back in her chair.
“The mob and the cops were involved in the whole thing. Talk about an uphill battle. At that time, the lesbians, queens and gays were not exactly a team.”
“Really? You’d think people treating all of you like dirt would be enough to pull everyone together,” she said.
“Well, to be fair, I’ve seen the same sort of division in the women’s movement.”
“You’re right.” She paused and said, “Things are going to change. They’ve got to. We have no control over who we fall in love with.” She lit one of the two cigarettes she had left. “Would you like one?” she offered. He waved it off. “Do you have somebody special in your life?” she asked.
“Yes, I do. A man named Christopher.” Allen’s eyes lit up.
“How did you meet?”
“Everyone thinks we met at a fashion show. We met while waiting for a cab. Long story short, we ended up sharing one and kept on sharing.”
“How long are the two of you together?”
“Almost a year,” he answered with a smile.
“How did you know it was love?”
“Oh, good Lord. How does anyone ever truly know? I wish I could say that it was love at first sight. Like a bolt of lightning jabbing me in the heart and I would never be the same. I think that’s bull. It never happens that way. How about you? Is there someone special?”
“No,” she said, stood and tossed her bag over her shoulder. She sighed as she thought about the bill. “I don’t even have enough money for a decent tip. I promise I will pay you back.” As she passed the kaleidoscope painting, she stopped to take a closer look but gasped when she saw the price.
He stood and tossed a few bills on the table. As he passed the waitress, he shoved a few additional bills into her pocket. “Thank you, dear.” She smiled at him, then continued to pour coffee into another young man’s cup, flirting away with her latest customer.
It felt good to have something substantial in her stomach for a change. As they left the eatery and headed north, a sophisticated man walked toward them. His Dobermann ignored the noises around him. “Geeze. Check out this beautiful beast,” she gushed. “Excuse me. May I pet him?” she asked the gentleman.
“He can be skittish,” he replied.
Mel held her hand out palm down. She let the dog take its time sniffing, and then she turned her hand over. He began to lick her fingers.
“Well, I’ll be,” said the man.
“My trick is to let them smell me when I just finished eating,” she joked. The gentleman chuckled as he and his pet went on with their walk.
“You like dogs?” Allen asked.
“To be honest, I love them. Dogs are such wonderful creatures. They love you no matter what. That’s hard to find.”
“Let me get a cab.” There were none in sight. While they waited at the curb, a policeman began to cross the street and headed toward them. Allen shoved his hand into his pockets and quietly asked, “Would you take my arm?”
Mel did not realize what was happening but did what he had asked. It was then that she noticed the officer. Mel laid her head on his shoulder and focused her gaze on a couple window shopping across the street. Once he had passed, she removed her arm from his. “I hate that fucking shit,” she hissed. Allen looked down at her face. Her eyes were blazing. He waved down an approaching cab, and they piled in.
“You can’t let it get to you,” he said in a matter-of fact kind of way. He turned his attention to the cabbie and said, “West Central Park and 69th.” This time, she accepted when he offered a cigarette.
Pulling her hair back, she leaned into the lighter’s flame. She sighed. “I’m not able to pay for anything, and it’s driving me nuts. I’m embarrassed,” and sighed again. “As soon as I…”
“Later, OK?” he asked and patted her hand.
She could not help but look up at all the high-reaching buildings that stood in Manhattan. “I can never get over just how immense this place is.” Her head was just about upside down, trying to get the best possible view.
“Yes. You are adorable.” She didn’t hear him. The city and all its energy had her full attention. Allen turned to the gorgeous driver. When they arrived at his address, the cabbie thanked Allen for the tip. He also handed him a slip of paper with his name and number on it.
Allen just smiled and put it in his pocket.
A uniformed doorman held open the heavy glass door. “Good afternoon, Mr. Shandi.”
“Hey there, George. How are Christina and the baby?”
“They are wonderful, thanks for asking.”
“Come on. You must have a picture, yes?”
With that, George pulled his wallet out of his pocket and opened it to a photo.
“Oh,” Allen said with a sigh. “Oh my gosh. They are lovely. Is Penelope about four months old now? Look at these beautiful women, Mel.”
She took the wallet. The woman in the photo looked thrilled to be a mom. Little Penelope’s toothless grin was precious. “You are a very lucky man,” she said placing her hand on her abdomen. Still smiling, she handed it back to him.
“Yes, I am.” George took a few seconds to look at the picture before putting it away.
“By the way, Christopher has taken Daphne for a walk.”
Allen gave him a wink. “Thanks, George.”
The elevator required a unique key to go to the penthouse. Mel and Allen rode it nine floors up. When the elevator doors opened, they stepped into a small area with a large door across the way. He opened it and they entered an extravagant vestibule. Mel had never seen or could even imagine such wealth. An older gentleman greeted Allen with his mail and messages.
He looked inquisitively at Melanie.
Allen said, “This is my sweet friend, Melanie. Mel, this is Quinten. If you need or want anything, this is your man.”
Mel extended her hand out to Quinten and said, “Nice to meet you.” He hesitated and looked at Allen. Allen grinned.
He took her hand and said, “It’s very nice to meet you. Would you prefer Mel or Melanie?”
“Either is fine. May I use the bathroom?”
“Of course, follow me, please.”
The bathroom was straight ahead and to the right. It was below a winding staircase with full bookshelves. Quinten lightly pressed the spine of a red and black book, and a door opened outward. Orange-yellow light spilled out onto the tiled floor.
“I’ve never actually seen a secret door. Very cool! Thank you,” she said and went inside. The dominant color was red, and the accent colors were black, gold and purple. Tiles of red with gold swirls outlined in black covered the bottom half of the walls. The upper half was crimson. She was sure the entire room was larger than her apartment. There were several black and red velvet ottomans and a purple and gold chaise lounge in a sitting area. On the other side of a half wall was the toilet and a bidet alongside it. Over the double sinks hung an enormous mirror with an ornate frame. She set her bag on the black marble counter between the sinks. As she sat on the toilet, she tried to take all of it in. “And this is just the bathroom,” she whispered. Once she’d finished, she washed her hands and raked her fingers through her hair.
Allen was waiting for her. “I’d like to show you something.” They went up the stairs and off to the left. After passing several rooms, Allen held open the door to a bedroom. She flashed him a confused expression.
“Oh! No. This isn’t one of those ‘I’d like to show you my etchings’ snares. I wanted to show you a few things from my collection. It’s through the doorway on the left.”
She did not budge. “Wait here,” he said and disappeared into that room. As he came back, he draped pieces of clothing on hangers across the bed. Spreading them out, he chose a backless sequin-covered halter top jumpsuit in champagne gold. “Isn’t this scrumptious?”
“It’s dazzling. But it’s not my style.”
He looked at the remainder of what was on the bed. “That’s the second time you’ve mentioned your style. What is your style, exactly?”
“I like a less feminine look, you know? I’ve always been a tomboy,” she said timidly. “Do you design things for men?”
The sound of quickly clicking toenails on the wood floor grew louder. With that, a magnificent Rottweiler burst into the room. “Daphne-love!” gushed Allen.
Catching his breath, Christopher followed. He stood over six feet tall, blonde hair parted on the right and trimmed with precision. Although he was slender, he was muscular the way 20-year-old men often are. “I’m back from our daily tug. She is going to pull my arm out one of these days,” he said.
Daphne’s interest shifted to the new scent in the room. Her full tail swished back and forth as she sniffed Mel’s feet and legs.
“Who is this?” Christopher asked, inspecting Mel.
She stuck out her hand, “I’m Mel Foster.” He hesitated for a moment, then took her hand. “It’s very nice to meet you,” she said. Still looking at Christopher, she asked, “Daphne’s tail is intact? I don’t think I’ve ever seen that. She’s a beauty.”
“We got her when she was a pup, and we specifically told them not to do that. It’s unthinkable,” Allen huffed.
Mel was on her knees, along with Christopher, cuddling and scratching her belly. “We had a large dog when I was little. Just a mutt, but at least 100 pounds. My father found a harness for her and it helped when we had to walk her.” Daphne jumped onto Mel knocking her back with her legs folded under her and began licking her face. Mel laughed and hugged her around the neck.
“Daphne!” Allen laughed. “Come! Come here, my girl.” She obediently went to his side.
“May I have a washcloth or something?” Mel asked once Allen had lured Daphne away.
Christopher answered, “Sure.” Mel followed him out of the bedroom and down the hall.
“Second door on the left,” he said with a forced smile.
She pushed the door, but it did not close all the way. Splashing her face with warm soap and water removed the drool from her face. Two black velvet ottomans placed side by side with a tiny table between were in the corner. She sat and took advantage of the small, crystal ashtray. Digging through her bag, she retrieved her last cigarette, matches and a hair clip. Taking a deep drag, she grabbed everything and went to the mirror. With the cigarette hanging from her mouth, she pulled her thick hair and piled it on the crown of her head. The extra-large leather slide barely fit over her mop of curls. She pushed the stick through the holes to secure everything in place. Invariably, five or six tendrils hung down around her neck, dripping down over her back and shoulders. She could hear a discussion growing louder coming from the bedroom. “She will end up becoming just another fag-hag for you. What is this, the fifth? I do not need yet another person hanging around watching us as if you and I were a freakshow,” Christopher said firmly.
“You are wrong about her. She’s one of us. Her ideas about women’s clothing are perfect for what’s down the road,” said Allen.
“Is that how you met her?” There was a pause.
Trying to make her presence known, Mel tugged the door open and stomped heavily onto the floor. Daphne flounced toward her. “I’m going to have to get going, little girl.” Holding either side of her enormous head, she kissed her loudly.
“Your hair. I love it!” declared Allen. “I have a proposal for you, Mel. You brought up a more masculine feel for women’s clothing. Would you help me bring that idea to life?” Allen asked.
“I don’t know the first thing about fashion.”
Christopher laughed, “You’ve got that right.”
“Now, now. Let’s not be bitchy,” said Allen.
Mel motioned toward Christopher while looking at Allen and said, “He understands that I do not…”
“Sometimes, all you need to know is what you like and what you don’t like,” said Allen. “Like art.” He grabbed her hand and led her to the back of the bedroom. After opening the double-door walk-in closet, he began to look through his clothes. He chose a white button-down shirt from his closet. “What would you do with this?” He held it out to her. His right arm was across his chest and was clutching his left bicep. His forearm extended outward with the palm of his hand facing the ceiling, and the shirt dangled from his fingertip. She would come to know this as his “What say you?” pose.
“Seriously?” She exhaled. Taking the shirt from him, she hung it from an indentation on one of the columns of the four-poster bed. Christopher gasped at the thought of damage done to the tiger maple column. “I would make it sleeveless and shorten the front to waist length.” She turned it around. Christopher stepped in and held it for her. “Thanks, Christopher. It could be darted a bit to fit my form, then lengthened the shirttail to fall just passed the…” she patted her rear.
“Ass?” Christopher asked. Allen gave him a look.
“Well, I was gonna say cheeks, but either fit. Split it up the middle to about two inches below the waistline. It would end up kind of like tails on a tux. If you could give it lapels rather than a collar, I think that would be something I’d like.”
“What would you wear with it?” asked Allen.
Taking a moment to think, she finally said, “I would wear straight leg jeans and man boots up to my knees. You know, the kind that you tie up in the front without the spiky heels.”
Allen looked over at Christopher and said, “Do you see what I mean?”
“Do you design clothes also, Christopher?”
He seemed insulted by the question. “I am a model,” he answered in a sharp tone.
“I’m sorry. I don’t read many magazines.” Pointing out her appearance with gesturing hands, she laughed, “Just look at me for crying out loud!”
“I have to give you that,” Christopher said.
“Honey, that’s not…” Allen started to say.
“But it’s funny and appropriate,” answered Mel. “Allen, thanks for all of this. I’ve got to get going.”
A nearly palpable look went from Allen to Christopher. Christopher shrugged his shoulders and said, “OK,” and he left the room.
“This might be forward, but I…we wondered if you would consider staying with us while we take Cleo in this new direction? This place has several empty rooms. But I think you’d truly love the one on the far end.”
“But I haven’t agreed to the clothing thing.”
He ignored her. She followed him to an enormous room down the hallway. Daphne’s toenails let them know she was right behind them. Everything was covered with sheets except the king-size bed. Sliding glass doors on the far side of the room led to a balcony complete with greenery and furniture. The walls were white, and the furniture was in varying shades of red. As the sun fell low in the sky, it cast a fantastic orangey-pink over everything around her, including Allen.
“Isn’t it gorgeous?”
“Yes, but I have a job,” she said.
He came toward her and held her by the shoulders. “This is an opportunity to grow. It will be your job. Name your price.” She was only aware of his hands on her. Everything else was a blur. “Please?” he asked, batting his eyes again. Allen bent down a bit to meet her eye and was inches from her face. “I need you.”
She paused, then finally said, “Yes. Thank you. Allen, I am so grateful…” but the lump in her throat and tears squelched her ability to speak.
Allen threw his arms around her and she pulled away just a bit. He laughed and said, “I’m sorry. I excite easily!”
“Good to know,” she said, patting him on the back. He laughed into her ear. The sensation of his breath on her neck was incredible and alarming at once. “I have one request.”
“Name it.”
She pulled back and placed her hands on his chest. “I am not a huggee, cuddly, touchy-feely person. Please, don’t take it the wrong way. You are such a great guy, a real gentleman. You would never deliberately hurt anyone. It just makes me uncomfortable.”
He looked into her eyes. “Of course, I can respect that.” He backed away. “I understand, you know. Maybe better than most. I was different, too.” She felt light-headed.
“Are you alright?” he asked.
“Yes. I think I need a shower and a good night’s sleep.”
“Can I have Quinten bring you a bite to eat?”
“No, not right now. If I get hungry, I’ll poke around the kitchen, if that’s OK.”
“It’s fine with me, but Quinten gets a bit touchy when his domain is disturbed.”
“I promise I’ll clean up after myself,” she offered.
“Good Lord, woman, I was joking! Feel free to have anything you’d like.” He left her room and closed the door behind him.
Chapter 3
By the next morning, all of Mel’s belongings had been picked up and delivered to the penthouse. That afternoon, Allen purchased a month’s worth of clothing for her right down to her panties, along with a carton of her favorite cigarettes plus several joints. She sat on the edge of the bed surrounded by all of it, including the jelly jar she’d given to Fred and her prized possession. It was an old lockbox. Taking the key out of her bag, she placed the box on her lap and opened it slowly. Lifting the three photographs of her brother, Benjamin, from inside, she traced his face with her finger. It also contained a spool of fishing line. She looked up to see Allen standing in the doorway. She closed the box and set it aside.
“Would you like a hand putting things away?” he asked.
“I can’t accept all of this.”
“Consider it an advance,” he said. “Anything you dislike will be returned, exchanged, whatever.” He walked toward her.
Mel stood and moved toward the middle of the room. “You could have let my friend keep the glass,” she remarked.
“I did something a little better, I think. I hope you agree. Fred now occupies your old apartment, and I’ve paid up for two years. He has several new outfits, a bit of cash, and will be filling in at your old job until you decide what you want to do. I will find another place for you to live if you think this isn’t working out, but I want you to share your ideas with me,” he said in a serious tone.
She turned away from him. “I’m going to do my very best for you. Thank you for giving me this chance.”
He moved toward her, then thought better of it. Quinten knocked on the door frame.
“Excuse me, Sir. How many for dinner tonight?”
“Six, I think. Very casual, OK?” Allen asked.
“Time?”
“Six-thirty.”
“Is there anything, in particular, you would like tonight, Sir?”
“Mel, if you sat down in a restaurant and could have anything you wanted, what would it be?” Allen asked her.
She chuckled. “I feel as if I’m in a dream, or I’m high. Maybe I’ve died and gone to Heaven.” She asked timidly, “Do you like spaghetti and meatballs and maybe a salad?”
“Perfect. Is that doable, Quinten?”
“Of course, Sir. Can I get you anything in the meantime, Miss Melanie?”
“No thanks, and for God’s sake, drop the Miss. You make me feel as if I’m the character in ‘Gone with the Wind’! Or worse, my mother.”
“Quinten, could you give us a minute?”
“Of course,” he said and went downstairs.
Allen sat on the bench at the foot of the bed. His legs crossed at the knee and leaning back on his hands. “Did I tell you how I ended up living here?” he asked Mel. She shook her head, no. He gestured with his hand for her to sit next to him. She sat beside him with her legs apart, her elbows resting on her thighs and hands folded. He brushed her hair over her shoulder.
“I just want to see your face, OK?”
“Yes,” she answered and looked at him.
“My father owned an oil conglomerate. It doesn’t matter which one. They are all greed-factories. He could buy and sell God, or so he said. The best part is that God got the last laugh. One morning he told his secretary that there were to be no phone calls, no interruptions. He had a massive heart attack at his desk while she typed away just outside his door. Side note, she was also his mistress. An hour and a half later, she poked her head in to ask a question. She found him sweat-soaked and face down in a pool of his vomit. The Man upstairs is a funny guy, don’t you agree?”
“I gather you were not close to him?”
“No one was. My father loved money and fucking women. If he could have figured out a way to bang them with a roll of hundreds on his cock, it would have been his ejaculation of a lifetime.”
“Wow,” she chuckled. “How did your mom take it?”
“Poor thing, she loved him and not for his money. She would tell me about the 19-year-old boy she’d met all those years ago. Generous, kind, hardworking and very gentle with her. Somewhere along the line, he soured. He began drinking to excess and worse, hitting her. He became ruthless.”
“Did he know you are gay?”
“I think if he’d spent just a bit of time with me, he would have. But you must be in the same room with a person, look into their eyes, listen to what they say to learn anything. My wonderful mother died two years after my father. Countless homes, cars, all kinds of ‘things’ had become the property of my brother and me. Did I tell you I have a brother? Keith. Funny guy. A good man. Anyway. He and I sold most of it and gave the money to charities for the homeless, hospitals, but the best was handing out money to anyone that looked like they could use it. We knew this would make the old bastard roll in his grave. Even better, we made the donations in his name.”
“Ooooh, you scoundrels. I love it,” she laughed.
“Quinten has been with our family since before I was born. He is an old-fashioned gentleman’s gentleman. He just can’t help himself. I know for certain there were times that he would intercept when that bastard was after my mom. He’d lie and say there was a phone call or news on TV about my father’s company. My father was so drunk he probably could have distracted him with a ring of keys, …like an infant. All that being said, Quinten is who he is, and we accept him that way. Alright?”
Her face was beet red. “Yes. Understood. I’ll make it right.” She looked back on the bed and asked, “I hate to sound like such a girl, but what are you wearing tonight?”
Allen laughed. “How do jeans and a shirt sound? Shoes are optional.”
“Comfortable, thank you.”
Allen’s chef, Wyatt Edmonds, had taken the time to ask Mel about her selection for dinner, right down to the amount of garlic or basil. He stood at six foot four and two hundred forty pounds of muscle. He looked extremely intimidating, but that turned out to be completely wrong. He was a gentle and soft-spoken man. It was moving to see his interest in what would make her happy.
That evening, softly playing jazz hung in the background. Allen and Christopher were in one of two black loveseats in a cozy area of the living room. The other loveseat was directly across from them, with two red high-back chairs between them facing the fireplace. A black lacquered coffee table sat between it all.
The first to arrive were two women that worked in the garment district. Eric had red cropped hair and was wearing a man’s blue button-down shirt tucked into her black jeans with a matching blue belt and sneakers.
Mel asked Eric, “May I ask, do you consider yourself a ‘he’ or ‘she’?”
“He, and thank you for asking.” His girlfriend, Meghan also had red hair, but shoulder length. She wore a short denim skirt, a red sweater and black high heels. After the introductions, Allen offered drinks. Eric would have his usual Pabst Blue Ribbon beer in a pint glass while Meghan preferred white wine. Rather than help, Christopher called out for a vodka and tonic. As Allen gave Eric and Meghan their drinks, he heard the elevator door open and excused himself. Mel went to the bar to make Christopher’s drink. She brought it to him and asked, “What do you think Allen will have?”
“I have no idea,” he answered, not meeting her eyes.
“Mel, meet Zora Preston. She is a buyer for one of the high-end stores on 5th Avenue. Zora, Mel Foster.”
She was a tall, curvy African American woman with a beautiful, giant Afro. She wore a tight-fitting, sleeveless black turtleneck sweater, large gold hoop earrings and a floor-length striped skirt in all the colors of the rainbow. Mel smiled and shook her hand. “Do you prefer Mel or Melanie?” Zora asked in a soft and sexy voice.
“Either is fine.”
“Then, Melanie, it is.”
“Your hair is gorgeous!” Mel gushed.
“As is yours,” she responded, taking a handful and twirling it between her fingers.
“I told her just how beautiful you are, Mel. And did I lie?” Allen asked, holding his hands to her like the statuesque women on game shows would when displaying a new car.
Mel became an entirely new shade of red. “Allen, please.” She laughed and turned to Zora. “If you know Allen at all, then you know how generous he is with his compliments. Zora, what can I get you to drink?”
“I’ll have whatever you’re having,” she smiled, putting her hand on top of Mel’s. The sound of ice cubes clinking together came from Christopher. He’d raised his glass and shook it. Allen snatched it from his hand, then he and Mel went to the bar.
“What’s going on, Allen?”
“I’m sorry for Christopher’s behavior.”
“That’s not what I meant. Why is Zora here?”
“I thought the two of you might hit it off,” he said innocently.
“Oh, good Christ,” she said, leaning on the marble surface. She closed her eyes and said, “Are you under the impression that I am a lesbian?”
“Well, yes.”
“Oh, my God,” she whispered, then laughed. “I can’t be upset with you. A tomboy is a stone’s throw from that. No, I’m not a lesbian. This beautiful woman was brought here as my date?”
“I am so sorry,” he said, thoroughly embarrassed. “Let me talk to Zora.”
“No. That’s OK. Let me,” Mel said. After handing Christopher his drink, she asked, “Zora, would you mind checking out the wine selections?”
“Not at all.”
Allen watched out of the corner of his eye as Mel placed her hand on Zora’s back. Mel smiled at her and spoke softly. A look of confusion came across Zora’s face as Mel spoke but quickly changed to a warm smile. Zora placed her hand on Mel’s. She kissed her on the forehead and, with her thumb, wiped the lipstick it left behind. Their attention turned to the wine. Mel laughed loudly at something Zora said. Christopher smirked at Mel. “Idiot,” he said under his breath. Allen shot him a look.
The evening continued as if nothing had happened. The dining room table was set, complete with two flower arrangements. Allen and Christopher sat at opposite ends of the table. Eric and Meghan sat on one side and Mel and Zora on the other.
Mel asked Eric, “How long have you two been together?”
Eric lifted Meghan’s hand from under the table and kissed it. “Two years. The first time I saw Meghan, I was hooked. I couldn’t take my eyes off her. Then she turned and looked at me and smiled. I couldn’t believe it. Everything came into focus. People say things like the sky is bluer, the birds sing more sweetly, and that is the truth. She was just what I needed in my life,” Eric said and leaned in for a kiss.

PART ONE — HER STYLE
Chapter 1—September 6th, 1972
The night breeze was a welcome sensation after spending six hours working up a sweat cleaning one of the NYU buildings off Washington Square. This seedy side of town always put Melanie on edge. The drenched bandana covering her hair would stay in place until she was safely back in her room. Reaching into her purple bag, she found her keys. Before putting one foot on the sidewalk, she made sure the keys were spread apart and protruding between her fingers.
The walk to the Village Plaza Hotel took as long as smoking one cigarette, three quarters if she was nervous. Three drags in, she heard a low, angry voice. A lighter voice responded as if confused. In the darkness of a doorway off to the left, Melanie could make out a large man hanging over a smaller person.
“Faggot, yer gonna get yer fuckin’ ass kicked,” he growled while raising his massive fist back over his shoulder. It was then that Mel realized the smaller person was a man trying to cover his head with his hands.
Quickly, she stepped toward them. “Honey, where have you been?” she asked, pulling the bandana off her head. The growler, still clenching his fist, turned to look at her. For just a few seconds, he stared at her. Her dirty bell-bottoms and loosely fitting t-shirt covering her slender body did not distract him from the long, curly-cue, strawberry blonde hair that framed her beautiful face and fell to her elbows. With one hand on her hip, she flicked the cigarette to the side. For a fleeting moment, the only sounds were a few crickets communicating with each other. She took that time to smile and step toward him. When she was close enough to see him begin to smile back, her right arm swung around, connecting with his left cheek and eye. The punch itself was not remarkable, but the keys split his face and it had begun to bleed. He lost his balance just enough to allow her to finish the job by kneeing him in the groin. He yelped in pain as he fell over, clutching his crotch. Placing her arm under the light voiced man’s arm, she brought him to his feet.
All he could do was stare at her. Not for her hair and sweet face, but because he was dumbstruck. He’d seen only one other woman fight like that.
Grabbing his hand, they ran down Washington Place. Twice, she looked back to see if the beast was behind them. Tugging him to the right, they ran into the hotel. The man behind the desk in the lobby yelled, “Where are you going?”
“It’s me, Melanie, Mr. Jones.” The three flights of stairs took the last of her energy. Looking back over her shoulder, she felt a little safer. She had not let go of his hand. At times, he’d run right beside her, others ahead of her. They stopped on the third floor. She let go of him and bent over, hands on her knees, trying to catch her breath. With a sweeping motion, she tossed her hair back and stood upright. In front of her darkened doorway, she finally looked over at him. Once her eyes adjusted to the light, she saw his face. In the shadows of a dimly lit bare bulb screwed into the ceiling, she could see his smile. He leaned against the wall with his hand shaking against his chest.
“You’ll be OK,” she tried to say in a calm voice.
His long, dark brown, shiny hair fell in layers just below his shoulders. A pair of Aviator prescription glasses rested on his significant and masculine nose. Eyeliner enhanced his almond-shaped brown eyes and long lashes. Her eyes fell to his mouth, and she couldn’t help but stare at his lips. They were the kind that made women jealous. Both the top and bottom were full. The deep dimples were like perpetual parentheses on the edges of that extraordinary mouth. Once he stood up straight, Melanie guessed he was only a few inches taller than her, putting him at about 5’11”. A bead of blood rolled down over his eyelid.
“Looks like he got a punch in.” She handed him a tissue from her bag, put her blood-covered door key in the worn lock and opened it. He followed her inside.
The kitchen was no more than an area in the otherwise Lilliputian room. She pulled the only chair from the tiny table and motioned for him to sit.
“What’s your name?” she asked as she rinsed off her keys.
“Allen. Shandi.”
She smiled. “Like the beer?”
“No,” he smiled, “as in boisterous.” He looked around the room. It was shabby but clean. Not like anything he’d ever experienced. “And what is your name? I heard you say, ‘Melanie.’”
“Yeah. Melanie. Mel. Foster.”
“As in cultivate?”
“Nah. Like the Grant’s.”
His laugh was light and feminine. Mel pulled a small container from under the twin bed and put it on the threadbare rug next to him. Inside was an assortment of necessities. It contained a sewing needle stuck in a spool of white thread, a hammer, a box of band-aids, a roll of tape, and a small glass container of hydrogen peroxide. She retrieved a band-aid and the bottle.
“Would you take off your glasses, please?”
“Truth be told, my vision is horrible. I can only see about a foot in front of me without them,” he told her.
“I’d like to clean out that cut. That bastard was filthy. It wouldn’t surprise me if you caught something just by breathing in the same space as that creep did. Your glasses could use a wipe, too.” He removed them and tilted his head towards her. “This might sting a bit,” Mel warned. She lifted his thick hair away from his forehead. The aroma of pot and sandalwood floated up to her and it made her smile. She lightly patted his head with a paper towel with the tiniest bit of hydrogen peroxide.
“Jesus!” He winced.
“I’m sorry,” she said, and blew on the cut.
“I haven’t thanked you for saving me from that Neanderthal. What would ever make you go after something that size?”
She paused. “The ‘f’ word.”
“Fuck?”
“Faggot.” The very word made her purse her lips. “May I have your glasses?” She took them, gave them a quick cleaning on her shirt, and held them out to him.
He reached for her hand holding the paper towel, but she quickly pulled away. He was startled by her reaction. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean anything by it,” he said. “I should go. Thank you for your care and time.” He put his glasses back on, then got up and walked to the door.
She was still holding the bloodied paper towel as he closed the door behind him. Her head fell back. “Oh, good Christ,” she said, disappointed in herself. “Let it go!” she whispered.
Once she’d quickly washed the dirty coffee cup from that morning and rinsed herself off in front of the sink, she fell onto the bed. The sounds of New York City outside her window had finally become familiar to her. That was not what kept her from relaxing. The image of his face kept returning to her. Allen was beautiful. He’s gay. She punched her pillow in hopes of making it more comfortable and closed her eyes. Tomorrow is Saturday. She began a mental list of things to do. Things like laundry and groceries and such needed to be done. But then, she heard his laugh in her head. Her eyes opened, and she sighed. There will not be much in the way of sleep tonight. “Happy birthday to me,” she whispered.
Chapter 2
It was nearly noon when she opened her eyes. A light knock on the door startled her. She jumped out of bed and put on her robe.
“Who’s there?”
“I have a delivery for Miss Grant,” a deep voice said.
“Miss Grant?” she whispered, and then it clicked. “Hold on.” Grabbing her bag off the floor, she searched inside until she found a quarter at the bottom. Pulling the door open just a crack, she could see an enormous assortment of purple and white flowers. She opened it wide enough to take them. Slowly, the bouquet lowered, and Allen’s eyes came into view. He playfully batted them at her.
She laughed. “What’s this?”
“It’s just a modest gift in appreciation of your bravery. Also…” He handed her a large, beautifully wrapped box. She took it from him.
“Come on in, please. You didn’t have to do this.”
He placed the flowers on the tiny table, then turned to her. After adjusting his glasses against his nose, Allen stood with his hands behind his back. His skin-tight, shiny black jeans flared out into a modest bell. The shoes looked like women’s leather square-toed chunky-heeled pumps, but he made them look great. The tan tank top was sheer enough that the hair on his chest and the outline of his nipples were evident. Around his neck he wore a slender black leather tie that was loosened and hung low on his chest. The knot itself was strange. A black silk scarf was wrapped several times around his left wrist and tied, leaving the ends hanging about six inches.
She sat on the bed, pulled off the wrapping, and lifted the lid. Inside was a proper first aid kit, a sewing kit complete with scissors, and a few smaller tools complete with two kinds of screwdrivers, a tape measure, pliers and an adjustable wrench.
“This is too much!”
He sat near her and took out an ‘L’ shaped piece of metal and examined it. “What is this?”
“It’s an Allen wrench,” she laughed. His smile disappeared, and he placed it back in the box. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to….” Tentatively, she patted his shoulder and rose from the bed. “Would you like a cup of coffee? All I have is instant.” She clutched her robe at the neck and started to open one of the two cabinets.
“I was hoping I could take you out for a bite. It’s a lovely day. We could walk a bit if you’d like.” Mel did not answer. “We could take a cab if you prefer.”
“I…I don’t have any clean clothes. Today is laundry day for me. Can I take a raincheck?” she finally asked, not meeting his eye as her face reddened.
“Well, this is all too perfect! How long will it take for you to put on whatever you would have worn to the laundromat? In 15 minutes, I’ll have a cab out front, alright?”
“I don’t…”
“Please?” He held out his hand. She looked down, smiled and swatted her fingertips with his.
“Alright, then. Meet me outside in fifteen minutes,” Allen said with a smile. Just before he closed the door, he looked back at her, flashed that incredible smile again, and gave a quick nod in a way that somehow relaxed any of her suspicious feelings.
She lifted a pair of hip huggers from the top of a pile of clothes in her closet and shook them out. Her only clean shirt was a lilac sleeveless turtleneck her brother made for her. She brushed her teeth with one hand and ran her fingers through her thick hair with the other. Laying out two pieces of bread on the counter, she assembled a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. She rinsed out the paper coffee cup she’d saved from the day before and filled it with milk. The lid still fit. There were far too many beautiful flowers in her bouquet not to share. She chose three cosmoses, cut the stems, and set them in a little water-filled jelly jar. Splashing water on her face, she looked at her reflection in the aged mirror on the wall. As ready as I’ll ever be. Taking a deep breath, Melanie slung her bag over her shoulder. She tried to walk calmly down the three flights of stairs.
Through the dirty front door window, she could see Allen leaning on a cab, chatting with the driver. Just then, a tall blonde man walked by them. Both heads swiveled, taking a long look at his ass. She had to chuckle.
“I’d check that out myself,” she whispered.
The day was quite a bit cooler than the day before. Allen took a cigarette from his pocket, along with a gold lighter. As he lit up, he saw Melanie walking toward him. She turned to the homeless man sitting up against the building. “Fred, here’s a little something to eat. Would you save me the glass?” He reached out for the paper bag and cup. With his free hand, he took hers and kissed it. Mumbling something unintelligible to her, she smiled and gave him the flowers.
He placed them up against his leg, cupped his hand around the glass and admired his gift.
A breeze drifted down the street. Melanie’s nipples shriveled from the cold air. Her knee-jerk reaction was to draw her arms up to her chest. Allen noticed and immediately felt embarrassed for her.
A policeman walked by them and stopped to observe Allen. He grabbed Mel’s hand, opened the door to the cab, and helped her in. Walking to the other side, Allen kept an eye on him. He tipped an imaginary cap to the officer and climbed inside. “Broome and Mercer,” he directed and turned to her. “You are adorable!” he said, smiling at Mel. The cabbie stared at him through the rearview mirror.
“Where were you coming from last night?” he asked her.
“My job. I didn’t ask you how your head is.”
He smiled. “It’s fine. Where do you work?”
“In the evenings, I clean some of the buildings at NYU.” She lifted his hair away from the cut. Clicking her tongue at the sight of the half dollar sized bruise developing, she asked, “Did you ice this?”
“No. How old are you?”
“20. And you?”
“24. Where are you from originally?”
“Upstate New York. A tiny town no one’s ever heard of.”
“Is that where you learned to fight?” he asked with a smile.
The color seemed to drain from her face. A silence hung between them until the cab hit a pothole that sent them both leaning hard to the right. She caught Allen as he fell against her.
Her loud, nervous laugh made its debut, and it certainly could draw attention.
“Oh my! Well, I love that sound!” he said.
The cab pulled over and made a hard stop. “Broome and Mercer, Mr. Shandi.” Allen’s tight pants forced him to lean to the left awkwardly. Jamming his right hand in his front pocket, he retrieved a bundle of bills. Mel glanced down at his hands. The bulge to the left of the bottom of his zipper caught her off guard. She very quickly looked away. He gave the cabbie a $5 tip.
“Thank you, Mr. Shandi!” His hand began to tremble as he put his money away. She took notice, and he caught that. He exited, went to her side of the cab and opened the door. Offering her his left hand, he helped her climb out.
“Are you hungry? I’m hungry. Let’s get lunch. My treat,” he said, looking across the street. He grabbed her hand and they sprinted through the traffic. Horns began honking, and a few cars stopped short. He held his hand up in a thanks gesture. She loved the way his hair bounced as he trotted. They entered a narrow eatery. A decidedly gay man welcomed Allen.
“Mr. Shandi, it’s so good to see you again. Your table is ready.” Other couples that had been waiting were not regulars or did not carry the same weight as Allen. She did not know what to make of this.
They were seated across from one another in a dark and quiet corner. Paper menus were brought to the table by a pretty young lady. “What can I get you to drink, Mr. Shandi?” she asked in a coquettish manner. She reached past Melanie’s face to light the candle and replaced the dirty ashtray with a clean one.
“What would you like, Mel?”
No one had called her that in at least five years.
“Coffee please, with milk?” she asked, looking at the waitress.
“I’ll have the same.”
The waitress placed her hand on his shoulder and said, “You’ve got it, Honey.” She walked away with quite a sway in her hips. Mel grinned and looked over to see Allen reaching for her over the table. He took a lock of her curly hair and rolled it between his fingers.
“If mermaids were real, this is the kind of hair they would have.”
She laughed as her face turned red. “Wow. I’ve never heard that before.” The art that was curiously placed up against the wall caught her eye. One piece in particular stood out. “Take a peek at that one! It’s a kaleidoscope!” She turned her attention back to his face. He’d been staring at her. Feeling embarrassed, she pretended to go over the menu. “Where are you from?” Mel asked.
“I’m not an interesting person,” he said while lighting a cigarette. “Would you like one?” he offered.
“No, thanks. I don’t want to hear your deepest, darkest secrets. How about, what do you do for a living? I feel like I’m the only one not in on it. Everybody knows you. I’ve lived here for five months, and I have no idea what you do or why you are so,” she paused, “beloved.”
“Beloved. That’s interesting.” He propped up his elbow on the table, and he rested his chin in his hand. The smoke from his cigarette curled up around his face. She sat back in the chair and crossed her ankle over her knee. Lacing her fingers together, she rested her hands in her lap. Giving him an “I’ve got all day” look, she took a deep breath.
Tapping his cigarette on the ashtray, he asked, “Have you ever heard of a clothing line called ‘Cleo’?”
“Yes. Do you work for her?”
“Well, I am her, so to speak. I named it after a knot I created for a necktie.” He pointed to the one that hung from his neck. It almost appeared to be a braid, and yet it was not. “The business has been open for three and a half years. It was perfect timing for my vision of what young women wanted. And the rest as they say…” he laughed, waving his cigarette in the air.
The waitress returned with the coffee. “Have you decided what you’d like to eat?” she asked, staring directly at Allen.
“Not really. Can we have a few more minutes?”
“Sure, Honey,” she answered and sashayed away, stopping once to look over her shoulder at Allen. But his thoughts were elsewhere.
“Have you always known you were…a visionary?” Mel asked as she stirred her coffee.
Allen glanced around to see if anyone was within earshot. He whispered, “What exactly are you asking?”
“My brother made this top for me. Not really my style, but he made it with love.” She gently touched the gauzy fabric around her neck. “Ben knew he was gay from the time he was a little boy,” Mel said softly. Her eyes welled up. “My mother simply ignored that fact. My father had an altogether different take on Ben. The things he would punish him for, well, it would just break your heart. That bastard took off in 1965. Good riddance.”
“Where is Ben now?”
“Buried in the Oswegatchie Cemetery outside of Fine, NY. Fine, NY! Funny, huh?” she laughed to cover the sadness.
More customers had begun to fill the place. The waitress returned once more. “What will it be?” she asked.
“Mel?” he asked.
She kept her head down and asked, “May I have a burger?” A tear rolled down her nose and fell on the menu.
“I’ll have the same,” he said. The waitress jotted it down as she walked away.
He gave Mel his napkin. “Dry your eyes, Sweetness,” then moved to a chair next to her and put his arm around her shoulders. “There are souls that are just too beautiful for this world,” he whispered in her ear. She had thought the very same thing a thousand times.
Two gay teens cautiously approached the table. Mel looked up. “Your fans, Mr. S! If you’ll excuse me…” The young men nearly levitated over a chance to chat with Allen. He watched her walk through a narrow doorway and into the restroom.
Splashing a little water on her face, she looked at her reflection. Her hands gripped the sides of the sink. “Pull it together,” she whispered to herself. Once she’d collected herself with a few deep breaths, she headed back to the table. She stopped and watched Allen as he spoke to them. He listened carefully as they replied and talked about their dreams.
Allen was leaning forward, elbows on his knees and speaking softly. He was incredibly patient as he explained what it took to get where he was. His enormous smile was evidence that he seemed to enjoy this part of his celebrity.
She leaned against the door frame, legs crossed at the ankles, her arms crossed just below her chest.
The two teens stood close to each other. For a second, their pinkies hooked together. Allen grinned. Removing the scarf from his wrist, he tied it around the wrist of the young man on the left, then lifted the tie from his neck and put it on the other fan. He held out his hand to shake theirs.
An older couple seated at a nearby table shook their heads in disapproval. Mel stood and stared at them for a moment, then turned her back and obstructed their view. The boys practically pogoed over to her.
“Johnny, isn’t he amazing?” the shorter of the two asked his boyfriend.
He grinned at Mel and said, “He’s amazing!”
“He certainly is,” she replied. The boys left overwhelmed with joy about what had just happened.
The burgers arrived at the table as Mel sat back down. “Thank you,” she said to the waitress and tried to make eye contact.
Finally, she looked at Mel and said, “You’re welcome.”
“Those kids will be living on that for a long time. That’s just about the sweetest thing I have ever seen,” she told him.
“I could say that about what you did for the guy sitting in front of your building earlier, but I won’t. Mine was sweeter.”
Her laugh reached the customers near the front door. “Sorry,” she said, covering her mouth, trying to muffle the sound. “You are a brat!”
“The boys’ names are Jon and Johnny. Isn’t that sweet? They’re hoping to open a clothing store in the village.” As he set his coffee cup on the saucer, his hand trembled again, rattling both. “Don’t ever apologize for your laugh. I like people that let their emotions out. I’d hate to think what would happen if you tried to hold that inside. It could be catastrophic! Your eyes and brain would be scattered everywhere!” he nearly shrilled, while his hand swiped through the air as if he were carrying a tray of filled coffee cups.
She was about to ask him about his hand, but he stood, excused himself, and headed toward the restroom. His hand, his life. It was quite simply none of her business.
When he returned, they continued to talk for another hour or so. Allen had participated in the Stonewall riots and Mel wanted to learn about every scrap of it.
“I witnessed the woman, Storme DeLarverie, fighting the cops. Some aren’t sure it was her, but I’m convinced it was. When she yelled out to us, ‘Why don’t you guys do something?’ we all went crazy. I guess we all have a boiling point.”
“Truer words, my friend. Ben wanted so much to be a part of it. He never hid who he was. All he ever wanted was to work for, well, someone exactly like you. Damn, you would have loved him,” she said, leaning back in her chair.
“The mob and the cops were involved in the whole thing. Talk about an uphill battle. At that time, the lesbians, queens and gays were not exactly a team.”
“Really? You’d think people treating all of you like dirt would be enough to pull everyone together,” she said.
“Well, to be fair, I’ve seen the same sort of division in the women’s movement.”
“You’re right.” She paused and said, “Things are going to change. They’ve got to. We have no control over who we fall in love with.” She lit one of the two cigarettes she had left. “Would you like one?” she offered. He waved it off. “Do you have somebody special in your life?” she asked.
“Yes, I do. A man named Christopher.” Allen’s eyes lit up.
“How did you meet?”
“Everyone thinks we met at a fashion show. We met while waiting for a cab. Long story short, we ended up sharing one and kept on sharing.”
“How long are the two of you together?”
“Almost a year,” he answered with a smile.
“How did you know it was love?”
“Oh, good Lord. How does anyone ever truly know? I wish I could say that it was love at first sight. Like a bolt of lightning jabbing me in the heart and I would never be the same. I think that’s bull. It never happens that way. How about you? Is there someone special?”
“No,” she said, stood and tossed her bag over her shoulder. She sighed as she thought about the bill. “I don’t even have enough money for a decent tip. I promise I will pay you back.” As she passed the kaleidoscope painting, she stopped to take a closer look but gasped when she saw the price.
He stood and tossed a few bills on the table. As he passed the waitress, he shoved a few additional bills into her pocket. “Thank you, dear.” She smiled at him, then continued to pour coffee into another young man’s cup, flirting away with her latest customer.
It felt good to have something substantial in her stomach for a change. As they left the eatery and headed north, a sophisticated man walked toward them. His Dobermann ignored the noises around him. “Geeze. Check out this beautiful beast,” she gushed. “Excuse me. May I pet him?” she asked the gentleman.
“He can be skittish,” he replied.
Mel held her hand out palm down. She let the dog take its time sniffing, and then she turned her hand over. He began to lick her fingers.
“Well, I’ll be,” said the man.
“My trick is to let them smell me when I just finished eating,” she joked. The gentleman chuckled as he and his pet went on with their walk.
“You like dogs?” Allen asked.
“To be honest, I love them. Dogs are such wonderful creatures. They love you no matter what. That’s hard to find.”
“Let me get a cab.” There were none in sight. While they waited at the curb, a policeman began to cross the street and headed toward them. Allen shoved his hand into his pockets and quietly asked, “Would you take my arm?”
Mel did not realize what was happening but did what he had asked. It was then that she noticed the officer. Mel laid her head on his shoulder and focused her gaze on a couple window shopping across the street. Once he had passed, she removed her arm from his. “I hate that fucking shit,” she hissed. Allen looked down at her face. Her eyes were blazing. He waved down an approaching cab, and they piled in.
“You can’t let it get to you,” he said in a matter-of fact kind of way. He turned his attention to the cabbie and said, “West Central Park and 69th.” This time, she accepted when he offered a cigarette.
Pulling her hair back, she leaned into the lighter’s flame. She sighed. “I’m not able to pay for anything, and it’s driving me nuts. I’m embarrassed,” and sighed again. “As soon as I…”
“Later, OK?” he asked and patted her hand.
She could not help but look up at all the high-reaching buildings that stood in Manhattan. “I can never get over just how immense this place is.” Her head was just about upside down, trying to get the best possible view.
“Yes. You are adorable.” She didn’t hear him. The city and all its energy had her full attention. Allen turned to the gorgeous driver. When they arrived at his address, the cabbie thanked Allen for the tip. He also handed him a slip of paper with his name and number on it.
Allen just smiled and put it in his pocket.
A uniformed doorman held open the heavy glass door. “Good afternoon, Mr. Shandi.”
“Hey there, George. How are Christina and the baby?”
“They are wonderful, thanks for asking.”
“Come on. You must have a picture, yes?”
With that, George pulled his wallet out of his pocket and opened it to a photo.
“Oh,” Allen said with a sigh. “Oh my gosh. They are lovely. Is Penelope about four months old now? Look at these beautiful women, Mel.”
She took the wallet. The woman in the photo looked thrilled to be a mom. Little Penelope’s toothless grin was precious. “You are a very lucky man,” she said placing her hand on her abdomen. Still smiling, she handed it back to him.
“Yes, I am.” George took a few seconds to look at the picture before putting it away.
“By the way, Christopher has taken Daphne for a walk.”
Allen gave him a wink. “Thanks, George.”
The elevator required a unique key to go to the penthouse. Mel and Allen rode it nine floors up. When the elevator doors opened, they stepped into a small area with a large door across the way. He opened it and they entered an extravagant vestibule. Mel had never seen or could even imagine such wealth. An older gentleman greeted Allen with his mail and messages.
He looked inquisitively at Melanie.
Allen said, “This is my sweet friend, Melanie. Mel, this is Quinten. If you need or want anything, this is your man.”
Mel extended her hand out to Quinten and said, “Nice to meet you.” He hesitated and looked at Allen. Allen grinned.
He took her hand and said, “It’s very nice to meet you. Would you prefer Mel or Melanie?”
“Either is fine. May I use the bathroom?”
“Of course, follow me, please.”
The bathroom was straight ahead and to the right. It was below a winding staircase with full bookshelves. Quinten lightly pressed the spine of a red and black book, and a door opened outward. Orange-yellow light spilled out onto the tiled floor.
“I’ve never actually seen a secret door. Very cool! Thank you,” she said and went inside. The dominant color was red, and the accent colors were black, gold and purple. Tiles of red with gold swirls outlined in black covered the bottom half of the walls. The upper half was crimson. She was sure the entire room was larger than her apartment. There were several black and red velvet ottomans and a purple and gold chaise lounge in a sitting area. On the other side of a half wall was the toilet and a bidet alongside it. Over the double sinks hung an enormous mirror with an ornate frame. She set her bag on the black marble counter between the sinks. As she sat on the toilet, she tried to take all of it in. “And this is just the bathroom,” she whispered. Once she’d finished, she washed her hands and raked her fingers through her hair.
Allen was waiting for her. “I’d like to show you something.” They went up the stairs and off to the left. After passing several rooms, Allen held open the door to a bedroom. She flashed him a confused expression.
“Oh! No. This isn’t one of those ‘I’d like to show you my etchings’ snares. I wanted to show you a few things from my collection. It’s through the doorway on the left.”
She did not budge. “Wait here,” he said and disappeared into that room. As he came back, he draped pieces of clothing on hangers across the bed. Spreading them out, he chose a backless sequin-covered halter top jumpsuit in champagne gold. “Isn’t this scrumptious?”
“It’s dazzling. But it’s not my style.”
He looked at the remainder of what was on the bed. “That’s the second time you’ve mentioned your style. What is your style, exactly?”
“I like a less feminine look, you know? I’ve always been a tomboy,” she said timidly. “Do you design things for men?”
The sound of quickly clicking toenails on the wood floor grew louder. With that, a magnificent Rottweiler burst into the room. “Daphne-love!” gushed Allen.
Catching his breath, Christopher followed. He stood over six feet tall, blonde hair parted on the right and trimmed with precision. Although he was slender, he was muscular the way 20-year-old men often are. “I’m back from our daily tug. She is going to pull my arm out one of these days,” he said.
Daphne’s interest shifted to the new scent in the room. Her full tail swished back and forth as she sniffed Mel’s feet and legs.
“Who is this?” Christopher asked, inspecting Mel.
She stuck out her hand, “I’m Mel Foster.” He hesitated for a moment, then took her hand. “It’s very nice to meet you,” she said. Still looking at Christopher, she asked, “Daphne’s tail is intact? I don’t think I’ve ever seen that. She’s a beauty.”
“We got her when she was a pup, and we specifically told them not to do that. It’s unthinkable,” Allen huffed.
Mel was on her knees, along with Christopher, cuddling and scratching her belly. “We had a large dog when I was little. Just a mutt, but at least 100 pounds. My father found a harness for her and it helped when we had to walk her.” Daphne jumped onto Mel knocking her back with her legs folded under her and began licking her face. Mel laughed and hugged her around the neck.
“Daphne!” Allen laughed. “Come! Come here, my girl.” She obediently went to his side.
“May I have a washcloth or something?” Mel asked once Allen had lured Daphne away.
Christopher answered, “Sure.” Mel followed him out of the bedroom and down the hall.
“Second door on the left,” he said with a forced smile.
She pushed the door, but it did not close all the way. Splashing her face with warm soap and water removed the drool from her face. Two black velvet ottomans placed side by side with a tiny table between were in the corner. She sat and took advantage of the small, crystal ashtray. Digging through her bag, she retrieved her last cigarette, matches and a hair clip. Taking a deep drag, she grabbed everything and went to the mirror. With the cigarette hanging from her mouth, she pulled her thick hair and piled it on the crown of her head. The extra-large leather slide barely fit over her mop of curls. She pushed the stick through the holes to secure everything in place. Invariably, five or six tendrils hung down around her neck, dripping down over her back and shoulders. She could hear a discussion growing louder coming from the bedroom. “She will end up becoming just another fag-hag for you. What is this, the fifth? I do not need yet another person hanging around watching us as if you and I were a freakshow,” Christopher said firmly.
“You are wrong about her. She’s one of us. Her ideas about women’s clothing are perfect for what’s down the road,” said Allen.
“Is that how you met her?” There was a pause.
Trying to make her presence known, Mel tugged the door open and stomped heavily onto the floor. Daphne flounced toward her. “I’m going to have to get going, little girl.” Holding either side of her enormous head, she kissed her loudly.
“Your hair. I love it!” declared Allen. “I have a proposal for you, Mel. You brought up a more masculine feel for women’s clothing. Would you help me bring that idea to life?” Allen asked.
“I don’t know the first thing about fashion.”
Christopher laughed, “You’ve got that right.”
“Now, now. Let’s not be bitchy,” said Allen.
Mel motioned toward Christopher while looking at Allen and said, “He understands that I do not…”
“Sometimes, all you need to know is what you like and what you don’t like,” said Allen. “Like art.” He grabbed her hand and led her to the back of the bedroom. After opening the double-door walk-in closet, he began to look through his clothes. He chose a white button-down shirt from his closet. “What would you do with this?” He held it out to her. His right arm was across his chest and was clutching his left bicep. His forearm extended outward with the palm of his hand facing the ceiling, and the shirt dangled from his fingertip. She would come to know this as his “What say you?” pose.
“Seriously?” She exhaled. Taking the shirt from him, she hung it from an indentation on one of the columns of the four-poster bed. Christopher gasped at the thought of damage done to the tiger maple column. “I would make it sleeveless and shorten the front to waist length.” She turned it around. Christopher stepped in and held it for her. “Thanks, Christopher. It could be darted a bit to fit my form, then lengthened the shirttail to fall just passed the…” she patted her rear.
“Ass?” Christopher asked. Allen gave him a look.
“Well, I was gonna say cheeks, but either fit. Split it up the middle to about two inches below the waistline. It would end up kind of like tails on a tux. If you could give it lapels rather than a collar, I think that would be something I’d like.”
“What would you wear with it?” asked Allen.
Taking a moment to think, she finally said, “I would wear straight leg jeans and man boots up to my knees. You know, the kind that you tie up in the front without the spiky heels.”
Allen looked over at Christopher and said, “Do you see what I mean?”
“Do you design clothes also, Christopher?”
He seemed insulted by the question. “I am a model,” he answered in a sharp tone.
“I’m sorry. I don’t read many magazines.” Pointing out her appearance with gesturing hands, she laughed, “Just look at me for crying out loud!”
“I have to give you that,” Christopher said.
“Honey, that’s not…” Allen started to say.
“But it’s funny and appropriate,” answered Mel. “Allen, thanks for all of this. I’ve got to get going.”
A nearly palpable look went from Allen to Christopher. Christopher shrugged his shoulders and said, “OK,” and he left the room.
“This might be forward, but I…we wondered if you would consider staying with us while we take Cleo in this new direction? This place has several empty rooms. But I think you’d truly love the one on the far end.”
“But I haven’t agreed to the clothing thing.”
He ignored her. She followed him to an enormous room down the hallway. Daphne’s toenails let them know she was right behind them. Everything was covered with sheets except the king-size bed. Sliding glass doors on the far side of the room led to a balcony complete with greenery and furniture. The walls were white, and the furniture was in varying shades of red. As the sun fell low in the sky, it cast a fantastic orangey-pink over everything around her, including Allen.
“Isn’t it gorgeous?”
“Yes, but I have a job,” she said.
He came toward her and held her by the shoulders. “This is an opportunity to grow. It will be your job. Name your price.” She was only aware of his hands on her. Everything else was a blur. “Please?” he asked, batting his eyes again. Allen bent down a bit to meet her eye and was inches from her face. “I need you.”
She paused, then finally said, “Yes. Thank you. Allen, I am so grateful…” but the lump in her throat and tears squelched her ability to speak.
Allen threw his arms around her and she pulled away just a bit. He laughed and said, “I’m sorry. I excite easily!”
“Good to know,” she said, patting him on the back. He laughed into her ear. The sensation of his breath on her neck was incredible and alarming at once. “I have one request.”
“Name it.”
She pulled back and placed her hands on his chest. “I am not a huggee, cuddly, touchy-feely person. Please, don’t take it the wrong way. You are such a great guy, a real gentleman. You would never deliberately hurt anyone. It just makes me uncomfortable.”
He looked into her eyes. “Of course, I can respect that.” He backed away. “I understand, you know. Maybe better than most. I was different, too.” She felt light-headed.
“Are you alright?” he asked.
“Yes. I think I need a shower and a good night’s sleep.”
“Can I have Quinten bring you a bite to eat?”
“No, not right now. If I get hungry, I’ll poke around the kitchen, if that’s OK.”
“It’s fine with me, but Quinten gets a bit touchy when his domain is disturbed.”
“I promise I’ll clean up after myself,” she offered.
“Good Lord, woman, I was joking! Feel free to have anything you’d like.” He left her room and closed the door behind him.
Chapter 3
By the next morning, all of Mel’s belongings had been picked up and delivered to the penthouse. That afternoon, Allen purchased a month’s worth of clothing for her right down to her panties, along with a carton of her favorite cigarettes plus several joints. She sat on the edge of the bed surrounded by all of it, including the jelly jar she’d given to Fred and her prized possession. It was an old lockbox. Taking the key out of her bag, she placed the box on her lap and opened it slowly. Lifting the three photographs of her brother, Benjamin, from inside, she traced his face with her finger. It also contained a spool of fishing line. She looked up to see Allen standing in the doorway. She closed the box and set it aside.
“Would you like a hand putting things away?” he asked.
“I can’t accept all of this.”
“Consider it an advance,” he said. “Anything you dislike will be returned, exchanged, whatever.” He walked toward her.
Mel stood and moved toward the middle of the room. “You could have let my friend keep the glass,” she remarked.
“I did something a little better, I think. I hope you agree. Fred now occupies your old apartment, and I’ve paid up for two years. He has several new outfits, a bit of cash, and will be filling in at your old job until you decide what you want to do. I will find another place for you to live if you think this isn’t working out, but I want you to share your ideas with me,” he said in a serious tone.
She turned away from him. “I’m going to do my very best for you. Thank you for giving me this chance.”
He moved toward her, then thought better of it. Quinten knocked on the door frame.
“Excuse me, Sir. How many for dinner tonight?”
“Six, I think. Very casual, OK?” Allen asked.
“Time?”
“Six-thirty.”
“Is there anything, in particular, you would like tonight, Sir?”
“Mel, if you sat down in a restaurant and could have anything you wanted, what would it be?” Allen asked her.
She chuckled. “I feel as if I’m in a dream, or I’m high. Maybe I’ve died and gone to Heaven.” She asked timidly, “Do you like spaghetti and meatballs and maybe a salad?”
“Perfect. Is that doable, Quinten?”
“Of course, Sir. Can I get you anything in the meantime, Miss Melanie?”
“No thanks, and for God’s sake, drop the Miss. You make me feel as if I’m the character in ‘Gone with the Wind’! Or worse, my mother.”
“Quinten, could you give us a minute?”
“Of course,” he said and went downstairs.
Allen sat on the bench at the foot of the bed. His legs crossed at the knee and leaning back on his hands. “Did I tell you how I ended up living here?” he asked Mel. She shook her head, no. He gestured with his hand for her to sit next to him. She sat beside him with her legs apart, her elbows resting on her thighs and hands folded. He brushed her hair over her shoulder.
“I just want to see your face, OK?”
“Yes,” she answered and looked at him.
“My father owned an oil conglomerate. It doesn’t matter which one. They are all greed-factories. He could buy and sell God, or so he said. The best part is that God got the last laugh. One morning he told his secretary that there were to be no phone calls, no interruptions. He had a massive heart attack at his desk while she typed away just outside his door. Side note, she was also his mistress. An hour and a half later, she poked her head in to ask a question. She found him sweat-soaked and face down in a pool of his vomit. The Man upstairs is a funny guy, don’t you agree?”
“I gather you were not close to him?”
“No one was. My father loved money and fucking women. If he could have figured out a way to bang them with a roll of hundreds on his cock, it would have been his ejaculation of a lifetime.”
“Wow,” she chuckled. “How did your mom take it?”
“Poor thing, she loved him and not for his money. She would tell me about the 19-year-old boy she’d met all those years ago. Generous, kind, hardworking and very gentle with her. Somewhere along the line, he soured. He began drinking to excess and worse, hitting her. He became ruthless.”
“Did he know you are gay?”
“I think if he’d spent just a bit of time with me, he would have. But you must be in the same room with a person, look into their eyes, listen to what they say to learn anything. My wonderful mother died two years after my father. Countless homes, cars, all kinds of ‘things’ had become the property of my brother and me. Did I tell you I have a brother? Keith. Funny guy. A good man. Anyway. He and I sold most of it and gave the money to charities for the homeless, hospitals, but the best was handing out money to anyone that looked like they could use it. We knew this would make the old bastard roll in his grave. Even better, we made the donations in his name.”
“Ooooh, you scoundrels. I love it,” she laughed.
“Quinten has been with our family since before I was born. He is an old-fashioned gentleman’s gentleman. He just can’t help himself. I know for certain there were times that he would intercept when that bastard was after my mom. He’d lie and say there was a phone call or news on TV about my father’s company. My father was so drunk he probably could have distracted him with a ring of keys, …like an infant. All that being said, Quinten is who he is, and we accept him that way. Alright?”
Her face was beet red. “Yes. Understood. I’ll make it right.” She looked back on the bed and asked, “I hate to sound like such a girl, but what are you wearing tonight?”
Allen laughed. “How do jeans and a shirt sound? Shoes are optional.”
“Comfortable, thank you.”
Allen’s chef, Wyatt Edmonds, had taken the time to ask Mel about her selection for dinner, right down to the amount of garlic or basil. He stood at six foot four and two hundred forty pounds of muscle. He looked extremely intimidating, but that turned out to be completely wrong. He was a gentle and soft-spoken man. It was moving to see his interest in what would make her happy.
That evening, softly playing jazz hung in the background. Allen and Christopher were in one of two black loveseats in a cozy area of the living room. The other loveseat was directly across from them, with two red high-back chairs between them facing the fireplace. A black lacquered coffee table sat between it all.
The first to arrive were two women that worked in the garment district. Eric had red cropped hair and was wearing a man’s blue button-down shirt tucked into her black jeans with a matching blue belt and sneakers.
Mel asked Eric, “May I ask, do you consider yourself a ‘he’ or ‘she’?”
“He, and thank you for asking.” His girlfriend, Meghan also had red hair, but shoulder length. She wore a short denim skirt, a red sweater and black high heels. After the introductions, Allen offered drinks. Eric would have his usual Pabst Blue Ribbon beer in a pint glass while Meghan preferred white wine. Rather than help, Christopher called out for a vodka and tonic. As Allen gave Eric and Meghan their drinks, he heard the elevator door open and excused himself. Mel went to the bar to make Christopher’s drink. She brought it to him and asked, “What do you think Allen will have?”
“I have no idea,” he answered, not meeting her eyes.
“Mel, meet Zora Preston. She is a buyer for one of the high-end stores on 5th Avenue. Zora, Mel Foster.”
She was a tall, curvy African American woman with a beautiful, giant Afro. She wore a tight-fitting, sleeveless black turtleneck sweater, large gold hoop earrings and a floor-length striped skirt in all the colors of the rainbow. Mel smiled and shook her hand. “Do you prefer Mel or Melanie?” Zora asked in a soft and sexy voice.
“Either is fine.”
“Then, Melanie, it is.”
“Your hair is gorgeous!” Mel gushed.
“As is yours,” she responded, taking a handful and twirling it between her fingers.
“I told her just how beautiful you are, Mel. And did I lie?” Allen asked, holding his hands to her like the statuesque women on game shows would when displaying a new car.
Mel became an entirely new shade of red. “Allen, please.” She laughed and turned to Zora. “If you know Allen at all, then you know how generous he is with his compliments. Zora, what can I get you to drink?”
“I’ll have whatever you’re having,” she smiled, putting her hand on top of Mel’s. The sound of ice cubes clinking together came from Christopher. He’d raised his glass and shook it. Allen snatched it from his hand, then he and Mel went to the bar.
“What’s going on, Allen?”
“I’m sorry for Christopher’s behavior.”
“That’s not what I meant. Why is Zora here?”
“I thought the two of you might hit it off,” he said innocently.
“Oh, good Christ,” she said, leaning on the marble surface. She closed her eyes and said, “Are you under the impression that I am a lesbian?”
“Well, yes.”
“Oh, my God,” she whispered, then laughed. “I can’t be upset with you. A tomboy is a stone’s throw from that. No, I’m not a lesbian. This beautiful woman was brought here as my date?”
“I am so sorry,” he said, thoroughly embarrassed. “Let me talk to Zora.”
“No. That’s OK. Let me,” Mel said. After handing Christopher his drink, she asked, “Zora, would you mind checking out the wine selections?”
“Not at all.”
Allen watched out of the corner of his eye as Mel placed her hand on Zora’s back. Mel smiled at her and spoke softly. A look of confusion came across Zora’s face as Mel spoke but quickly changed to a warm smile. Zora placed her hand on Mel’s. She kissed her on the forehead and, with her thumb, wiped the lipstick it left behind. Their attention turned to the wine. Mel laughed loudly at something Zora said. Christopher smirked at Mel. “Idiot,” he said under his breath. Allen shot him a look.
The evening continued as if nothing had happened. The dining room table was set, complete with two flower arrangements. Allen and Christopher sat at opposite ends of the table. Eric and Meghan sat on one side and Mel and Zora on the other.
Mel asked Eric, “How long have you two been together?”
Eric lifted Meghan’s hand from under the table and kissed it. “Two years. The first time I saw Meghan, I was hooked. I couldn’t take my eyes off her. Then she turned and looked at me and smiled. I couldn’t believe it. Everything came into focus. People say things like the sky is bluer, the birds sing more sweetly, and that is the truth. She was just what I needed in my life,” Eric said and leaned in for a kiss.

PART ONE — HER STYLE
Chapter 1—September 6th, 1972
The night breeze was a welcome sensation after spending six hours working up a sweat cleaning one of the NYU buildings off Washington Square. This seedy side of town always put Melanie on edge. The drenched bandana covering her hair would stay in place until she was safely back in her room. Reaching into her purple bag, she found her keys. Before putting one foot on the sidewalk, she made sure the keys were spread apart and protruding between her fingers.
The walk to the Village Plaza Hotel took as long as smoking one cigarette, three quarters if she was nervous. Three drags in, she heard a low, angry voice. A lighter voice responded as if confused. In the darkness of a doorway off to the left, Melanie could make out a large man hanging over a smaller person.
“Faggot, yer gonna get yer fuckin’ ass kicked,” he growled while raising his massive fist back over his shoulder. It was then that Mel realized the smaller person was a man trying to cover his head with his hands.
Quickly, she stepped toward them. “Honey, where have you been?” she asked, pulling the bandana off her head. The growler, still clenching his fist, turned to look at her. For just a few seconds, he stared at her. Her dirty bell-bottoms and loosely fitting t-shirt covering her slender body did not distract him from the long, curly-cue, strawberry blonde hair that framed her beautiful face and fell to her elbows. With one hand on her hip, she flicked the cigarette to the side. For a fleeting moment, the only sounds were a few crickets communicating with each other. She took that time to smile and step toward him. When she was close enough to see him begin to smile back, her right arm swung around, connecting with his left cheek and eye. The punch itself was not remarkable, but the keys split his face and it had begun to bleed. He lost his balance just enough to allow her to finish the job by kneeing him in the groin. He yelped in pain as he fell over, clutching his crotch. Placing her arm under the light voiced man’s arm, she brought him to his feet.
All he could do was stare at her. Not for her hair and sweet face, but because he was dumbstruck. He’d seen only one other woman fight like that.
Grabbing his hand, they ran down Washington Place. Twice, she looked back to see if the beast was behind them. Tugging him to the right, they ran into the hotel. The man behind the desk in the lobby yelled, “Where are you going?”
“It’s me, Melanie, Mr. Jones.” The three flights of stairs took the last of her energy. Looking back over her shoulder, she felt a little safer. She had not let go of his hand. At times, he’d run right beside her, others ahead of her. They stopped on the third floor. She let go of him and bent over, hands on her knees, trying to catch her breath. With a sweeping motion, she tossed her hair back and stood upright. In front of her darkened doorway, she finally looked over at him. Once her eyes adjusted to the light, she saw his face. In the shadows of a dimly lit bare bulb screwed into the ceiling, she could see his smile. He leaned against the wall with his hand shaking against his chest.
“You’ll be OK,” she tried to say in a calm voice.
His long, dark brown, shiny hair fell in layers just below his shoulders. A pair of Aviator prescription glasses rested on his significant and masculine nose. Eyeliner enhanced his almond-shaped brown eyes and long lashes. Her eyes fell to his mouth, and she couldn’t help but stare at his lips. They were the kind that made women jealous. Both the top and bottom were full. The deep dimples were like perpetual parentheses on the edges of that extraordinary mouth. Once he stood up straight, Melanie guessed he was only a few inches taller than her, putting him at about 5’11”. A bead of blood rolled down over his eyelid.
“Looks like he got a punch in.” She handed him a tissue from her bag, put her blood-covered door key in the worn lock and opened it. He followed her inside.
The kitchen was no more than an area in the otherwise Lilliputian room. She pulled the only chair from the tiny table and motioned for him to sit.
“What’s your name?” she asked as she rinsed off her keys.
“Allen. Shandi.”
She smiled. “Like the beer?”
“No,” he smiled, “as in boisterous.” He looked around the room. It was shabby but clean. Not like anything he’d ever experienced. “And what is your name? I heard you say, ‘Melanie.’”
“Yeah. Melanie. Mel. Foster.”
“As in cultivate?”
“Nah. Like the Grant’s.”
His laugh was light and feminine. Mel pulled a small container from under the twin bed and put it on the threadbare rug next to him. Inside was an assortment of necessities. It contained a sewing needle stuck in a spool of white thread, a hammer, a box of band-aids, a roll of tape, and a small glass container of hydrogen peroxide. She retrieved a band-aid and the bottle.
“Would you take off your glasses, please?”
“Truth be told, my vision is horrible. I can only see about a foot in front of me without them,” he told her.
“I’d like to clean out that cut. That bastard was filthy. It wouldn’t surprise me if you caught something just by breathing in the same space as that creep did. Your glasses could use a wipe, too.” He removed them and tilted his head towards her. “This might sting a bit,” Mel warned. She lifted his thick hair away from his forehead. The aroma of pot and sandalwood floated up to her and it made her smile. She lightly patted his head with a paper towel with the tiniest bit of hydrogen peroxide.
“Jesus!” He winced.
“I’m sorry,” she said, and blew on the cut.
“I haven’t thanked you for saving me from that Neanderthal. What would ever make you go after something that size?”
She paused. “The ‘f’ word.”
“Fuck?”
“Faggot.” The very word made her purse her lips. “May I have your glasses?” She took them, gave them a quick cleaning on her shirt, and held them out to him.
He reached for her hand holding the paper towel, but she quickly pulled away. He was startled by her reaction. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean anything by it,” he said. “I should go. Thank you for your care and time.” He put his glasses back on, then got up and walked to the door.
She was still holding the bloodied paper towel as he closed the door behind him. Her head fell back. “Oh, good Christ,” she said, disappointed in herself. “Let it go!” she whispered.
Once she’d quickly washed the dirty coffee cup from that morning and rinsed herself off in front of the sink, she fell onto the bed. The sounds of New York City outside her window had finally become familiar to her. That was not what kept her from relaxing. The image of his face kept returning to her. Allen was beautiful. He’s gay. She punched her pillow in hopes of making it more comfortable and closed her eyes. Tomorrow is Saturday. She began a mental list of things to do. Things like laundry and groceries and such needed to be done. But then, she heard his laugh in her head. Her eyes opened, and she sighed. There will not be much in the way of sleep tonight. “Happy birthday to me,” she whispered.
Chapter 2
It was nearly noon when she opened her eyes. A light knock on the door startled her. She jumped out of bed and put on her robe.
“Who’s there?”
“I have a delivery for Miss Grant,” a deep voice said.
“Miss Grant?” she whispered, and then it clicked. “Hold on.” Grabbing her bag off the floor, she searched inside until she found a quarter at the bottom. Pulling the door open just a crack, she could see an enormous assortment of purple and white flowers. She opened it wide enough to take them. Slowly, the bouquet lowered, and Allen’s eyes came into view. He playfully batted them at her.
She laughed. “What’s this?”
“It’s just a modest gift in appreciation of your bravery. Also…” He handed her a large, beautifully wrapped box. She took it from him.
“Come on in, please. You didn’t have to do this.”
He placed the flowers on the tiny table, then turned to her. After adjusting his glasses against his nose, Allen stood with his hands behind his back. His skin-tight, shiny black jeans flared out into a modest bell. The shoes looked like women’s leather square-toed chunky-heeled pumps, but he made them look great. The tan tank top was sheer enough that the hair on his chest and the outline of his nipples were evident. Around his neck he wore a slender black leather tie that was loosened and hung low on his chest. The knot itself was strange. A black silk scarf was wrapped several times around his left wrist and tied, leaving the ends hanging about six inches.
She sat on the bed, pulled off the wrapping, and lifted the lid. Inside was a proper first aid kit, a sewing kit complete with scissors, and a few smaller tools complete with two kinds of screwdrivers, a tape measure, pliers and an adjustable wrench.
“This is too much!”
He sat near her and took out an ‘L’ shaped piece of metal and examined it. “What is this?”
“It’s an Allen wrench,” she laughed. His smile disappeared, and he placed it back in the box. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to….” Tentatively, she patted his shoulder and rose from the bed. “Would you like a cup of coffee? All I have is instant.” She clutched her robe at the neck and started to open one of the two cabinets.
“I was hoping I could take you out for a bite. It’s a lovely day. We could walk a bit if you’d like.” Mel did not answer. “We could take a cab if you prefer.”
“I…I don’t have any clean clothes. Today is laundry day for me. Can I take a raincheck?” she finally asked, not meeting his eye as her face reddened.
“Well, this is all too perfect! How long will it take for you to put on whatever you would have worn to the laundromat? In 15 minutes, I’ll have a cab out front, alright?”
“I don’t…”
“Please?” He held out his hand. She looked down, smiled and swatted her fingertips with his.
“Alright, then. Meet me outside in fifteen minutes,” Allen said with a smile. Just before he closed the door, he looked back at her, flashed that incredible smile again, and gave a quick nod in a way that somehow relaxed any of her suspicious feelings.
She lifted a pair of hip huggers from the top of a pile of clothes in her closet and shook them out. Her only clean shirt was a lilac sleeveless turtleneck her brother made for her. She brushed her teeth with one hand and ran her fingers through her thick hair with the other. Laying out two pieces of bread on the counter, she assembled a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. She rinsed out the paper coffee cup she’d saved from the day before and filled it with milk. The lid still fit. There were far too many beautiful flowers in her bouquet not to share. She chose three cosmoses, cut the stems, and set them in a little water-filled jelly jar. Splashing water on her face, she looked at her reflection in the aged mirror on the wall. As ready as I’ll ever be. Taking a deep breath, Melanie slung her bag over her shoulder. She tried to walk calmly down the three flights of stairs.
Through the dirty front door window, she could see Allen leaning on a cab, chatting with the driver. Just then, a tall blonde man walked by them. Both heads swiveled, taking a long look at his ass. She had to chuckle.
“I’d check that out myself,” she whispered.
The day was quite a bit cooler than the day before. Allen took a cigarette from his pocket, along with a gold lighter. As he lit up, he saw Melanie walking toward him. She turned to the homeless man sitting up against the building. “Fred, here’s a little something to eat. Would you save me the glass?” He reached out for the paper bag and cup. With his free hand, he took hers and kissed it. Mumbling something unintelligible to her, she smiled and gave him the flowers.
He placed them up against his leg, cupped his hand around the glass and admired his gift.
A breeze drifted down the street. Melanie’s nipples shriveled from the cold air. Her knee-jerk reaction was to draw her arms up to her chest. Allen noticed and immediately felt embarrassed for her.
A policeman walked by them and stopped to observe Allen. He grabbed Mel’s hand, opened the door to the cab, and helped her in. Walking to the other side, Allen kept an eye on him. He tipped an imaginary cap to the officer and climbed inside. “Broome and Mercer,” he directed and turned to her. “You are adorable!” he said, smiling at Mel. The cabbie stared at him through the rearview mirror.
“Where were you coming from last night?” he asked her.
“My job. I didn’t ask you how your head is.”
He smiled. “It’s fine. Where do you work?”
“In the evenings, I clean some of the buildings at NYU.” She lifted his hair away from the cut. Clicking her tongue at the sight of the half dollar sized bruise developing, she asked, “Did you ice this?”
“No. How old are you?”
“20. And you?”
“24. Where are you from originally?”
“Upstate New York. A tiny town no one’s ever heard of.”
“Is that where you learned to fight?” he asked with a smile.
The color seemed to drain from her face. A silence hung between them until the cab hit a pothole that sent them both leaning hard to the right. She caught Allen as he fell against her.
Her loud, nervous laugh made its debut, and it certainly could draw attention.
“Oh my! Well, I love that sound!” he said.
The cab pulled over and made a hard stop. “Broome and Mercer, Mr. Shandi.” Allen’s tight pants forced him to lean to the left awkwardly. Jamming his right hand in his front pocket, he retrieved a bundle of bills. Mel glanced down at his hands. The bulge to the left of the bottom of his zipper caught her off guard. She very quickly looked away. He gave the cabbie a $5 tip.
“Thank you, Mr. Shandi!” His hand began to tremble as he put his money away. She took notice, and he caught that. He exited, went to her side of the cab and opened the door. Offering her his left hand, he helped her climb out.
“Are you hungry? I’m hungry. Let’s get lunch. My treat,” he said, looking across the street. He grabbed her hand and they sprinted through the traffic. Horns began honking, and a few cars stopped short. He held his hand up in a thanks gesture. She loved the way his hair bounced as he trotted. They entered a narrow eatery. A decidedly gay man welcomed Allen.
“Mr. Shandi, it’s so good to see you again. Your table is ready.” Other couples that had been waiting were not regulars or did not carry the same weight as Allen. She did not know what to make of this.
They were seated across from one another in a dark and quiet corner. Paper menus were brought to the table by a pretty young lady. “What can I get you to drink, Mr. Shandi?” she asked in a coquettish manner. She reached past Melanie’s face to light the candle and replaced the dirty ashtray with a clean one.
“What would you like, Mel?”
No one had called her that in at least five years.
“Coffee please, with milk?” she asked, looking at the waitress.
“I’ll have the same.”
The waitress placed her hand on his shoulder and said, “You’ve got it, Honey.” She walked away with quite a sway in her hips. Mel grinned and looked over to see Allen reaching for her over the table. He took a lock of her curly hair and rolled it between his fingers.
“If mermaids were real, this is the kind of hair they would have.”
She laughed as her face turned red. “Wow. I’ve never heard that before.” The art that was curiously placed up against the wall caught her eye. One piece in particular stood out. “Take a peek at that one! It’s a kaleidoscope!” She turned her attention back to his face. He’d been staring at her. Feeling embarrassed, she pretended to go over the menu. “Where are you from?” Mel asked.
“I’m not an interesting person,” he said while lighting a cigarette. “Would you like one?” he offered.
“No, thanks. I don’t want to hear your deepest, darkest secrets. How about, what do you do for a living? I feel like I’m the only one not in on it. Everybody knows you. I’ve lived here for five months, and I have no idea what you do or why you are so,” she paused, “beloved.”
“Beloved. That’s interesting.” He propped up his elbow on the table, and he rested his chin in his hand. The smoke from his cigarette curled up around his face. She sat back in the chair and crossed her ankle over her knee. Lacing her fingers together, she rested her hands in her lap. Giving him an “I’ve got all day” look, she took a deep breath.
Tapping his cigarette on the ashtray, he asked, “Have you ever heard of a clothing line called ‘Cleo’?”
“Yes. Do you work for her?”
“Well, I am her, so to speak. I named it after a knot I created for a necktie.” He pointed to the one that hung from his neck. It almost appeared to be a braid, and yet it was not. “The business has been open for three and a half years. It was perfect timing for my vision of what young women wanted. And the rest as they say…” he laughed, waving his cigarette in the air.
The waitress returned with the coffee. “Have you decided what you’d like to eat?” she asked, staring directly at Allen.
“Not really. Can we have a few more minutes?”
“Sure, Honey,” she answered and sashayed away, stopping once to look over her shoulder at Allen. But his thoughts were elsewhere.
“Have you always known you were…a visionary?” Mel asked as she stirred her coffee.
Allen glanced around to see if anyone was within earshot. He whispered, “What exactly are you asking?”
“My brother made this top for me. Not really my style, but he made it with love.” She gently touched the gauzy fabric around her neck. “Ben knew he was gay from the time he was a little boy,” Mel said softly. Her eyes welled up. “My mother simply ignored that fact. My father had an altogether different take on Ben. The things he would punish him for, well, it would just break your heart. That bastard took off in 1965. Good riddance.”
“Where is Ben now?”
“Buried in the Oswegatchie Cemetery outside of Fine, NY. Fine, NY! Funny, huh?” she laughed to cover the sadness.
More customers had begun to fill the place. The waitress returned once more. “What will it be?” she asked.
“Mel?” he asked.
She kept her head down and asked, “May I have a burger?” A tear rolled down her nose and fell on the menu.
“I’ll have the same,” he said. The waitress jotted it down as she walked away.
He gave Mel his napkin. “Dry your eyes, Sweetness,” then moved to a chair next to her and put his arm around her shoulders. “There are souls that are just too beautiful for this world,” he whispered in her ear. She had thought the very same thing a thousand times.
Two gay teens cautiously approached the table. Mel looked up. “Your fans, Mr. S! If you’ll excuse me…” The young men nearly levitated over a chance to chat with Allen. He watched her walk through a narrow doorway and into the restroom.
Splashing a little water on her face, she looked at her reflection. Her hands gripped the sides of the sink. “Pull it together,” she whispered to herself. Once she’d collected herself with a few deep breaths, she headed back to the table. She stopped and watched Allen as he spoke to them. He listened carefully as they replied and talked about their dreams.
Allen was leaning forward, elbows on his knees and speaking softly. He was incredibly patient as he explained what it took to get where he was. His enormous smile was evidence that he seemed to enjoy this part of his celebrity.
She leaned against the door frame, legs crossed at the ankles, her arms crossed just below her chest.
The two teens stood close to each other. For a second, their pinkies hooked together. Allen grinned. Removing the scarf from his wrist, he tied it around the wrist of the young man on the left, then lifted the tie from his neck and put it on the other fan. He held out his hand to shake theirs.
An older couple seated at a nearby table shook their heads in disapproval. Mel stood and stared at them for a moment, then turned her back and obstructed their view. The boys practically pogoed over to her.
“Johnny, isn’t he amazing?” the shorter of the two asked his boyfriend.
He grinned at Mel and said, “He’s amazing!”
“He certainly is,” she replied. The boys left overwhelmed with joy about what had just happened.
The burgers arrived at the table as Mel sat back down. “Thank you,” she said to the waitress and tried to make eye contact.
Finally, she looked at Mel and said, “You’re welcome.”
“Those kids will be living on that for a long time. That’s just about the sweetest thing I have ever seen,” she told him.
“I could say that about what you did for the guy sitting in front of your building earlier, but I won’t. Mine was sweeter.”
Her laugh reached the customers near the front door. “Sorry,” she said, covering her mouth, trying to muffle the sound. “You are a brat!”
“The boys’ names are Jon and Johnny. Isn’t that sweet? They’re hoping to open a clothing store in the village.” As he set his coffee cup on the saucer, his hand trembled again, rattling both. “Don’t ever apologize for your laugh. I like people that let their emotions out. I’d hate to think what would happen if you tried to hold that inside. It could be catastrophic! Your eyes and brain would be scattered everywhere!” he nearly shrilled, while his hand swiped through the air as if he were carrying a tray of filled coffee cups.
She was about to ask him about his hand, but he stood, excused himself, and headed toward the restroom. His hand, his life. It was quite simply none of her business.
When he returned, they continued to talk for another hour or so. Allen had participated in the Stonewall riots and Mel wanted to learn about every scrap of it.
“I witnessed the woman, Storme DeLarverie, fighting the cops. Some aren’t sure it was her, but I’m convinced it was. When she yelled out to us, ‘Why don’t you guys do something?’ we all went crazy. I guess we all have a boiling point.”
“Truer words, my friend. Ben wanted so much to be a part of it. He never hid who he was. All he ever wanted was to work for, well, someone exactly like you. Damn, you would have loved him,” she said, leaning back in her chair.
“The mob and the cops were involved in the whole thing. Talk about an uphill battle. At that time, the lesbians, queens and gays were not exactly a team.”
“Really? You’d think people treating all of you like dirt would be enough to pull everyone together,” she said.
“Well, to be fair, I’ve seen the same sort of division in the women’s movement.”
“You’re right.” She paused and said, “Things are going to change. They’ve got to. We have no control over who we fall in love with.” She lit one of the two cigarettes she had left. “Would you like one?” she offered. He waved it off. “Do you have somebody special in your life?” she asked.
“Yes, I do. A man named Christopher.” Allen’s eyes lit up.
“How did you meet?”
“Everyone thinks we met at a fashion show. We met while waiting for a cab. Long story short, we ended up sharing one and kept on sharing.”
“How long are the two of you together?”
“Almost a year,” he answered with a smile.
“How did you know it was love?”
“Oh, good Lord. How does anyone ever truly know? I wish I could say that it was love at first sight. Like a bolt of lightning jabbing me in the heart and I would never be the same. I think that’s bull. It never happens that way. How about you? Is there someone special?”
“No,” she said, stood and tossed her bag over her shoulder. She sighed as she thought about the bill. “I don’t even have enough money for a decent tip. I promise I will pay you back.” As she passed the kaleidoscope painting, she stopped to take a closer look but gasped when she saw the price.
He stood and tossed a few bills on the table. As he passed the waitress, he shoved a few additional bills into her pocket. “Thank you, dear.” She smiled at him, then continued to pour coffee into another young man’s cup, flirting away with her latest customer.
It felt good to have something substantial in her stomach for a change. As they left the eatery and headed north, a sophisticated man walked toward them. His Dobermann ignored the noises around him. “Geeze. Check out this beautiful beast,” she gushed. “Excuse me. May I pet him?” she asked the gentleman.
“He can be skittish,” he replied.
Mel held her hand out palm down. She let the dog take its time sniffing, and then she turned her hand over. He began to lick her fingers.
“Well, I’ll be,” said the man.
“My trick is to let them smell me when I just finished eating,” she joked. The gentleman chuckled as he and his pet went on with their walk.
“You like dogs?” Allen asked.
“To be honest, I love them. Dogs are such wonderful creatures. They love you no matter what. That’s hard to find.”
“Let me get a cab.” There were none in sight. While they waited at the curb, a policeman began to cross the street and headed toward them. Allen shoved his hand into his pockets and quietly asked, “Would you take my arm?”
Mel did not realize what was happening but did what he had asked. It was then that she noticed the officer. Mel laid her head on his shoulder and focused her gaze on a couple window shopping across the street. Once he had passed, she removed her arm from his. “I hate that fucking shit,” she hissed. Allen looked down at her face. Her eyes were blazing. He waved down an approaching cab, and they piled in.
“You can’t let it get to you,” he said in a matter-of fact kind of way. He turned his attention to the cabbie and said, “West Central Park and 69th.” This time, she accepted when he offered a cigarette.
Pulling her hair back, she leaned into the lighter’s flame. She sighed. “I’m not able to pay for anything, and it’s driving me nuts. I’m embarrassed,” and sighed again. “As soon as I…”
“Later, OK?” he asked and patted her hand.
She could not help but look up at all the high-reaching buildings that stood in Manhattan. “I can never get over just how immense this place is.” Her head was just about upside down, trying to get the best possible view.
“Yes. You are adorable.” She didn’t hear him. The city and all its energy had her full attention. Allen turned to the gorgeous driver. When they arrived at his address, the cabbie thanked Allen for the tip. He also handed him a slip of paper with his name and number on it.
Allen just smiled and put it in his pocket.
A uniformed doorman held open the heavy glass door. “Good afternoon, Mr. Shandi.”
“Hey there, George. How are Christina and the baby?”
“They are wonderful, thanks for asking.”
“Come on. You must have a picture, yes?”
With that, George pulled his wallet out of his pocket and opened it to a photo.
“Oh,” Allen said with a sigh. “Oh my gosh. They are lovely. Is Penelope about four months old now? Look at these beautiful women, Mel.”
She took the wallet. The woman in the photo looked thrilled to be a mom. Little Penelope’s toothless grin was precious. “You are a very lucky man,” she said placing her hand on her abdomen. Still smiling, she handed it back to him.
“Yes, I am.” George took a few seconds to look at the picture before putting it away.
“By the way, Christopher has taken Daphne for a walk.”
Allen gave him a wink. “Thanks, George.”
The elevator required a unique key to go to the penthouse. Mel and Allen rode it nine floors up. When the elevator doors opened, they stepped into a small area with a large door across the way. He opened it and they entered an extravagant vestibule. Mel had never seen or could even imagine such wealth. An older gentleman greeted Allen with his mail and messages.
He looked inquisitively at Melanie.
Allen said, “This is my sweet friend, Melanie. Mel, this is Quinten. If you need or want anything, this is your man.”
Mel extended her hand out to Quinten and said, “Nice to meet you.” He hesitated and looked at Allen. Allen grinned.
He took her hand and said, “It’s very nice to meet you. Would you prefer Mel or Melanie?”
“Either is fine. May I use the bathroom?”
“Of course, follow me, please.”
The bathroom was straight ahead and to the right. It was below a winding staircase with full bookshelves. Quinten lightly pressed the spine of a red and black book, and a door opened outward. Orange-yellow light spilled out onto the tiled floor.
“I’ve never actually seen a secret door. Very cool! Thank you,” she said and went inside. The dominant color was red, and the accent colors were black, gold and purple. Tiles of red with gold swirls outlined in black covered the bottom half of the walls. The upper half was crimson. She was sure the entire room was larger than her apartment. There were several black and red velvet ottomans and a purple and gold chaise lounge in a sitting area. On the other side of a half wall was the toilet and a bidet alongside it. Over the double sinks hung an enormous mirror with an ornate frame. She set her bag on the black marble counter between the sinks. As she sat on the toilet, she tried to take all of it in. “And this is just the bathroom,” she whispered. Once she’d finished, she washed her hands and raked her fingers through her hair.
Allen was waiting for her. “I’d like to show you something.” They went up the stairs and off to the left. After passing several rooms, Allen held open the door to a bedroom. She flashed him a confused expression.
“Oh! No. This isn’t one of those ‘I’d like to show you my etchings’ snares. I wanted to show you a few things from my collection. It’s through the doorway on the left.”
She did not budge. “Wait here,” he said and disappeared into that room. As he came back, he draped pieces of clothing on hangers across the bed. Spreading them out, he chose a backless sequin-covered halter top jumpsuit in champagne gold. “Isn’t this scrumptious?”
“It’s dazzling. But it’s not my style.”
He looked at the remainder of what was on the bed. “That’s the second time you’ve mentioned your style. What is your style, exactly?”
“I like a less feminine look, you know? I’ve always been a tomboy,” she said timidly. “Do you design things for men?”
The sound of quickly clicking toenails on the wood floor grew louder. With that, a magnificent Rottweiler burst into the room. “Daphne-love!” gushed Allen.
Catching his breath, Christopher followed. He stood over six feet tall, blonde hair parted on the right and trimmed with precision. Although he was slender, he was muscular the way 20-year-old men often are. “I’m back from our daily tug. She is going to pull my arm out one of these days,” he said.
Daphne’s interest shifted to the new scent in the room. Her full tail swished back and forth as she sniffed Mel’s feet and legs.
“Who is this?” Christopher asked, inspecting Mel.
She stuck out her hand, “I’m Mel Foster.” He hesitated for a moment, then took her hand. “It’s very nice to meet you,” she said. Still looking at Christopher, she asked, “Daphne’s tail is intact? I don’t think I’ve ever seen that. She’s a beauty.”
“We got her when she was a pup, and we specifically told them not to do that. It’s unthinkable,” Allen huffed.
Mel was on her knees, along with Christopher, cuddling and scratching her belly. “We had a large dog when I was little. Just a mutt, but at least 100 pounds. My father found a harness for her and it helped when we had to walk her.” Daphne jumped onto Mel knocking her back with her legs folded under her and began licking her face. Mel laughed and hugged her around the neck.
“Daphne!” Allen laughed. “Come! Come here, my girl.” She obediently went to his side.
“May I have a washcloth or something?” Mel asked once Allen had lured Daphne away.
Christopher answered, “Sure.” Mel followed him out of the bedroom and down the hall.
“Second door on the left,” he said with a forced smile.
She pushed the door, but it did not close all the way. Splashing her face with warm soap and water removed the drool from her face. Two black velvet ottomans placed side by side with a tiny table between were in the corner. She sat and took advantage of the small, crystal ashtray. Digging through her bag, she retrieved her last cigarette, matches and a hair clip. Taking a deep drag, she grabbed everything and went to the mirror. With the cigarette hanging from her mouth, she pulled her thick hair and piled it on the crown of her head. The extra-large leather slide barely fit over her mop of curls. She pushed the stick through the holes to secure everything in place. Invariably, five or six tendrils hung down around her neck, dripping down over her back and shoulders. She could hear a discussion growing louder coming from the bedroom. “She will end up becoming just another fag-hag for you. What is this, the fifth? I do not need yet another person hanging around watching us as if you and I were a freakshow,” Christopher said firmly.
“You are wrong about her. She’s one of us. Her ideas about women’s clothing are perfect for what’s down the road,” said Allen.
“Is that how you met her?” There was a pause.
Trying to make her presence known, Mel tugged the door open and stomped heavily onto the floor. Daphne flounced toward her. “I’m going to have to get going, little girl.” Holding either side of her enormous head, she kissed her loudly.
“Your hair. I love it!” declared Allen. “I have a proposal for you, Mel. You brought up a more masculine feel for women’s clothing. Would you help me bring that idea to life?” Allen asked.
“I don’t know the first thing about fashion.”
Christopher laughed, “You’ve got that right.”
“Now, now. Let’s not be bitchy,” said Allen.
Mel motioned toward Christopher while looking at Allen and said, “He understands that I do not…”
“Sometimes, all you need to know is what you like and what you don’t like,” said Allen. “Like art.” He grabbed her hand and led her to the back of the bedroom. After opening the double-door walk-in closet, he began to look through his clothes. He chose a white button-down shirt from his closet. “What would you do with this?” He held it out to her. His right arm was across his chest and was clutching his left bicep. His forearm extended outward with the palm of his hand facing the ceiling, and the shirt dangled from his fingertip. She would come to know this as his “What say you?” pose.
“Seriously?” She exhaled. Taking the shirt from him, she hung it from an indentation on one of the columns of the four-poster bed. Christopher gasped at the thought of damage done to the tiger maple column. “I would make it sleeveless and shorten the front to waist length.” She turned it around. Christopher stepped in and held it for her. “Thanks, Christopher. It could be darted a bit to fit my form, then lengthened the shirttail to fall just passed the…” she patted her rear.
“Ass?” Christopher asked. Allen gave him a look.
“Well, I was gonna say cheeks, but either fit. Split it up the middle to about two inches below the waistline. It would end up kind of like tails on a tux. If you could give it lapels rather than a collar, I think that would be something I’d like.”
“What would you wear with it?” asked Allen.
Taking a moment to think, she finally said, “I would wear straight leg jeans and man boots up to my knees. You know, the kind that you tie up in the front without the spiky heels.”
Allen looked over at Christopher and said, “Do you see what I mean?”
“Do you design clothes also, Christopher?”
He seemed insulted by the question. “I am a model,” he answered in a sharp tone.
“I’m sorry. I don’t read many magazines.” Pointing out her appearance with gesturing hands, she laughed, “Just look at me for crying out loud!”
“I have to give you that,” Christopher said.
“Honey, that’s not…” Allen started to say.
“But it’s funny and appropriate,” answered Mel. “Allen, thanks for all of this. I’ve got to get going.”
A nearly palpable look went from Allen to Christopher. Christopher shrugged his shoulders and said, “OK,” and he left the room.
“This might be forward, but I…we wondered if you would consider staying with us while we take Cleo in this new direction? This place has several empty rooms. But I think you’d truly love the one on the far end.”
“But I haven’t agreed to the clothing thing.”
He ignored her. She followed him to an enormous room down the hallway. Daphne’s toenails let them know she was right behind them. Everything was covered with sheets except the king-size bed. Sliding glass doors on the far side of the room led to a balcony complete with greenery and furniture. The walls were white, and the furniture was in varying shades of red. As the sun fell low in the sky, it cast a fantastic orangey-pink over everything around her, including Allen.
“Isn’t it gorgeous?”
“Yes, but I have a job,” she said.
He came toward her and held her by the shoulders. “This is an opportunity to grow. It will be your job. Name your price.” She was only aware of his hands on her. Everything else was a blur. “Please?” he asked, batting his eyes again. Allen bent down a bit to meet her eye and was inches from her face. “I need you.”
She paused, then finally said, “Yes. Thank you. Allen, I am so grateful…” but the lump in her throat and tears squelched her ability to speak.
Allen threw his arms around her and she pulled away just a bit. He laughed and said, “I’m sorry. I excite easily!”
“Good to know,” she said, patting him on the back. He laughed into her ear. The sensation of his breath on her neck was incredible and alarming at once. “I have one request.”
“Name it.”
She pulled back and placed her hands on his chest. “I am not a huggee, cuddly, touchy-feely person. Please, don’t take it the wrong way. You are such a great guy, a real gentleman. You would never deliberately hurt anyone. It just makes me uncomfortable.”
He looked into her eyes. “Of course, I can respect that.” He backed away. “I understand, you know. Maybe better than most. I was different, too.” She felt light-headed.
“Are you alright?” he asked.
“Yes. I think I need a shower and a good night’s sleep.”
“Can I have Quinten bring you a bite to eat?”
“No, not right now. If I get hungry, I’ll poke around the kitchen, if that’s OK.”
“It’s fine with me, but Quinten gets a bit touchy when his domain is disturbed.”
“I promise I’ll clean up after myself,” she offered.
“Good Lord, woman, I was joking! Feel free to have anything you’d like.” He left her room and closed the door behind him.
Chapter 3
By the next morning, all of Mel’s belongings had been picked up and delivered to the penthouse. That afternoon, Allen purchased a month’s worth of clothing for her right down to her panties, along with a carton of her favorite cigarettes plus several joints. She sat on the edge of the bed surrounded by all of it, including the jelly jar she’d given to Fred and her prized possession. It was an old lockbox. Taking the key out of her bag, she placed the box on her lap and opened it slowly. Lifting the three photographs of her brother, Benjamin, from inside, she traced his face with her finger. It also contained a spool of fishing line. She looked up to see Allen standing in the doorway. She closed the box and set it aside.
“Would you like a hand putting things away?” he asked.
“I can’t accept all of this.”
“Consider it an advance,” he said. “Anything you dislike will be returned, exchanged, whatever.” He walked toward her.
Mel stood and moved toward the middle of the room. “You could have let my friend keep the glass,” she remarked.
“I did something a little better, I think. I hope you agree. Fred now occupies your old apartment, and I’ve paid up for two years. He has several new outfits, a bit of cash, and will be filling in at your old job until you decide what you want to do. I will find another place for you to live if you think this isn’t working out, but I want you to share your ideas with me,” he said in a serious tone.
She turned away from him. “I’m going to do my very best for you. Thank you for giving me this chance.”
He moved toward her, then thought better of it. Quinten knocked on the door frame.
“Excuse me, Sir. How many for dinner tonight?”
“Six, I think. Very casual, OK?” Allen asked.
“Time?”
“Six-thirty.”
“Is there anything, in particular, you would like tonight, Sir?”
“Mel, if you sat down in a restaurant and could have anything you wanted, what would it be?” Allen asked her.
She chuckled. “I feel as if I’m in a dream, or I’m high. Maybe I’ve died and gone to Heaven.” She asked timidly, “Do you like spaghetti and meatballs and maybe a salad?”
“Perfect. Is that doable, Quinten?”
“Of course, Sir. Can I get you anything in the meantime, Miss Melanie?”
“No thanks, and for God’s sake, drop the Miss. You make me feel as if I’m the character in ‘Gone with the Wind’! Or worse, my mother.”
“Quinten, could you give us a minute?”
“Of course,” he said and went downstairs.
Allen sat on the bench at the foot of the bed. His legs crossed at the knee and leaning back on his hands. “Did I tell you how I ended up living here?” he asked Mel. She shook her head, no. He gestured with his hand for her to sit next to him. She sat beside him with her legs apart, her elbows resting on her thighs and hands folded. He brushed her hair over her shoulder.
“I just want to see your face, OK?”
“Yes,” she answered and looked at him.
“My father owned an oil conglomerate. It doesn’t matter which one. They are all greed-factories. He could buy and sell God, or so he said. The best part is that God got the last laugh. One morning he told his secretary that there were to be no phone calls, no interruptions. He had a massive heart attack at his desk while she typed away just outside his door. Side note, she was also his mistress. An hour and a half later, she poked her head in to ask a question. She found him sweat-soaked and face down in a pool of his vomit. The Man upstairs is a funny guy, don’t you agree?”
“I gather you were not close to him?”
“No one was. My father loved money and fucking women. If he could have figured out a way to bang them with a roll of hundreds on his cock, it would have been his ejaculation of a lifetime.”
“Wow,” she chuckled. “How did your mom take it?”
“Poor thing, she loved him and not for his money. She would tell me about the 19-year-old boy she’d met all those years ago. Generous, kind, hardworking and very gentle with her. Somewhere along the line, he soured. He began drinking to excess and worse, hitting her. He became ruthless.”
“Did he know you are gay?”
“I think if he’d spent just a bit of time with me, he would have. But you must be in the same room with a person, look into their eyes, listen to what they say to learn anything. My wonderful mother died two years after my father. Countless homes, cars, all kinds of ‘things’ had become the property of my brother and me. Did I tell you I have a brother? Keith. Funny guy. A good man. Anyway. He and I sold most of it and gave the money to charities for the homeless, hospitals, but the best was handing out money to anyone that looked like they could use it. We knew this would make the old bastard roll in his grave. Even better, we made the donations in his name.”
“Ooooh, you scoundrels. I love it,” she laughed.
“Quinten has been with our family since before I was born. He is an old-fashioned gentleman’s gentleman. He just can’t help himself. I know for certain there were times that he would intercept when that bastard was after my mom. He’d lie and say there was a phone call or news on TV about my father’s company. My father was so drunk he probably could have distracted him with a ring of keys, …like an infant. All that being said, Quinten is who he is, and we accept him that way. Alright?”
Her face was beet red. “Yes. Understood. I’ll make it right.” She looked back on the bed and asked, “I hate to sound like such a girl, but what are you wearing tonight?”
Allen laughed. “How do jeans and a shirt sound? Shoes are optional.”
“Comfortable, thank you.”
Allen’s chef, Wyatt Edmonds, had taken the time to ask Mel about her selection for dinner, right down to the amount of garlic or basil. He stood at six foot four and two hundred forty pounds of muscle. He looked extremely intimidating, but that turned out to be completely wrong. He was a gentle and soft-spoken man. It was moving to see his interest in what would make her happy.
That evening, softly playing jazz hung in the background. Allen and Christopher were in one of two black loveseats in a cozy area of the living room. The other loveseat was directly across from them, with two red high-back chairs between them facing the fireplace. A black lacquered coffee table sat between it all.
The first to arrive were two women that worked in the garment district. Eric had red cropped hair and was wearing a man’s blue button-down shirt tucked into her black jeans with a matching blue belt and sneakers.
Mel asked Eric, “May I ask, do you consider yourself a ‘he’ or ‘she’?”
“He, and thank you for asking.” His girlfriend, Meghan also had red hair, but shoulder length. She wore a short denim skirt, a red sweater and black high heels. After the introductions, Allen offered drinks. Eric would have his usual Pabst Blue Ribbon beer in a pint glass while Meghan preferred white wine. Rather than help, Christopher called out for a vodka and tonic. As Allen gave Eric and Meghan their drinks, he heard the elevator door open and excused himself. Mel went to the bar to make Christopher’s drink. She brought it to him and asked, “What do you think Allen will have?”
“I have no idea,” he answered, not meeting her eyes.
“Mel, meet Zora Preston. She is a buyer for one of the high-end stores on 5th Avenue. Zora, Mel Foster.”
She was a tall, curvy African American woman with a beautiful, giant Afro. She wore a tight-fitting, sleeveless black turtleneck sweater, large gold hoop earrings and a floor-length striped skirt in all the colors of the rainbow. Mel smiled and shook her hand. “Do you prefer Mel or Melanie?” Zora asked in a soft and sexy voice.
“Either is fine.”
“Then, Melanie, it is.”
“Your hair is gorgeous!” Mel gushed.
“As is yours,” she responded, taking a handful and twirling it between her fingers.
“I told her just how beautiful you are, Mel. And did I lie?” Allen asked, holding his hands to her like the statuesque women on game shows would when displaying a new car.
Mel became an entirely new shade of red. “Allen, please.” She laughed and turned to Zora. “If you know Allen at all, then you know how generous he is with his compliments. Zora, what can I get you to drink?”
“I’ll have whatever you’re having,” she smiled, putting her hand on top of Mel’s. The sound of ice cubes clinking together came from Christopher. He’d raised his glass and shook it. Allen snatched it from his hand, then he and Mel went to the bar.
“What’s going on, Allen?”
“I’m sorry for Christopher’s behavior.”
“That’s not what I meant. Why is Zora here?”
“I thought the two of you might hit it off,” he said innocently.
“Oh, good Christ,” she said, leaning on the marble surface. She closed her eyes and said, “Are you under the impression that I am a lesbian?”
“Well, yes.”
“Oh, my God,” she whispered, then laughed. “I can’t be upset with you. A tomboy is a stone’s throw from that. No, I’m not a lesbian. This beautiful woman was brought here as my date?”
“I am so sorry,” he said, thoroughly embarrassed. “Let me talk to Zora.”
“No. That’s OK. Let me,” Mel said. After handing Christopher his drink, she asked, “Zora, would you mind checking out the wine selections?”
“Not at all.”
Allen watched out of the corner of his eye as Mel placed her hand on Zora’s back. Mel smiled at her and spoke softly. A look of confusion came across Zora’s face as Mel spoke but quickly changed to a warm smile. Zora placed her hand on Mel’s. She kissed her on the forehead and, with her thumb, wiped the lipstick it left behind. Their attention turned to the wine. Mel laughed loudly at something Zora said. Christopher smirked at Mel. “Idiot,” he said under his breath. Allen shot him a look.
The evening continued as if nothing had happened. The dining room table was set, complete with two flower arrangements. Allen and Christopher sat at opposite ends of the table. Eric and Meghan sat on one side and Mel and Zora on the other.
Mel asked Eric, “How long have you two been together?”
Eric lifted Meghan’s hand from under the table and kissed it. “Two years. The first time I saw Meghan, I was hooked. I couldn’t take my eyes off her. Then she turned and looked at me and smiled. I couldn’t believe it. Everything came into focus. People say things like the sky is bluer, the birds sing more sweetly, and that is the truth. She was just what I needed in my life,” Eric said and leaned in for a kiss.

PART ONE — HER STYLE
Chapter 1—September 6th, 1972
The night breeze was a welcome sensation after spending six hours working up a sweat cleaning one of the NYU buildings off Washington Square. This seedy side of town always put Melanie on edge. The drenched bandana covering her hair would stay in place until she was safely back in her room. Reaching into her purple bag, she found her keys. Before putting one foot on the sidewalk, she made sure the keys were spread apart and protruding between her fingers.
The walk to the Village Plaza Hotel took as long as smoking one cigarette, three quarters if she was nervous. Three drags in, she heard a low, angry voice. A lighter voice responded as if confused. In the darkness of a doorway off to the left, Melanie could make out a large man hanging over a smaller person.
“Faggot, yer gonna get yer fuckin’ ass kicked,” he growled while raising his massive fist back over his shoulder. It was then that Mel realized the smaller person was a man trying to cover his head with his hands.
Quickly, she stepped toward them. “Honey, where have you been?” she asked, pulling the bandana off her head. The growler, still clenching his fist, turned to look at her. For just a few seconds, he stared at her. Her dirty bell-bottoms and loosely fitting t-shirt covering her slender body did not distract him from the long, curly-cue, strawberry blonde hair that framed her beautiful face and fell to her elbows. With one hand on her hip, she flicked the cigarette to the side. For a fleeting moment, the only sounds were a few crickets communicating with each other. She took that time to smile and step toward him. When she was close enough to see him begin to smile back, her right arm swung around, connecting with his left cheek and eye. The punch itself was not remarkable, but the keys split his face and it had begun to bleed. He lost his balance just enough to allow her to finish the job by kneeing him in the groin. He yelped in pain as he fell over, clutching his crotch. Placing her arm under the light voiced man’s arm, she brought him to his feet.
All he could do was stare at her. Not for her hair and sweet face, but because he was dumbstruck. He’d seen only one other woman fight like that.
Grabbing his hand, they ran down Washington Place. Twice, she looked back to see if the beast was behind them. Tugging him to the right, they ran into the hotel. The man behind the desk in the lobby yelled, “Where are you going?”
“It’s me, Melanie, Mr. Jones.” The three flights of stairs took the last of her energy. Looking back over her shoulder, she felt a little safer. She had not let go of his hand. At times, he’d run right beside her, others ahead of her. They stopped on the third floor. She let go of him and bent over, hands on her knees, trying to catch her breath. With a sweeping motion, she tossed her hair back and stood upright. In front of her darkened doorway, she finally looked over at him. Once her eyes adjusted to the light, she saw his face. In the shadows of a dimly lit bare bulb screwed into the ceiling, she could see his smile. He leaned against the wall with his hand shaking against his chest.
“You’ll be OK,” she tried to say in a calm voice.
His long, dark brown, shiny hair fell in layers just below his shoulders. A pair of Aviator prescription glasses rested on his significant and masculine nose. Eyeliner enhanced his almond-shaped brown eyes and long lashes. Her eyes fell to his mouth, and she couldn’t help but stare at his lips. They were the kind that made women jealous. Both the top and bottom were full. The deep dimples were like perpetual parentheses on the edges of that extraordinary mouth. Once he stood up straight, Melanie guessed he was only a few inches taller than her, putting him at about 5’11”. A bead of blood rolled down over his eyelid.
“Looks like he got a punch in.” She handed him a tissue from her bag, put her blood-covered door key in the worn lock and opened it. He followed her inside.
The kitchen was no more than an area in the otherwise Lilliputian room. She pulled the only chair from the tiny table and motioned for him to sit.
“What’s your name?” she asked as she rinsed off her keys.
“Allen. Shandi.”
She smiled. “Like the beer?”
“No,” he smiled, “as in boisterous.” He looked around the room. It was shabby but clean. Not like anything he’d ever experienced. “And what is your name? I heard you say, ‘Melanie.’”
“Yeah. Melanie. Mel. Foster.”
“As in cultivate?”
“Nah. Like the Grant’s.”
His laugh was light and feminine. Mel pulled a small container from under the twin bed and put it on the threadbare rug next to him. Inside was an assortment of necessities. It contained a sewing needle stuck in a spool of white thread, a hammer, a box of band-aids, a roll of tape, and a small glass container of hydrogen peroxide. She retrieved a band-aid and the bottle.
“Would you take off your glasses, please?”
“Truth be told, my vision is horrible. I can only see about a foot in front of me without them,” he told her.
“I’d like to clean out that cut. That bastard was filthy. It wouldn’t surprise me if you caught something just by breathing in the same space as that creep did. Your glasses could use a wipe, too.” He removed them and tilted his head towards her. “This might sting a bit,” Mel warned. She lifted his thick hair away from his forehead. The aroma of pot and sandalwood floated up to her and it made her smile. She lightly patted his head with a paper towel with the tiniest bit of hydrogen peroxide.
“Jesus!” He winced.
“I’m sorry,” she said, and blew on the cut.
“I haven’t thanked you for saving me from that Neanderthal. What would ever make you go after something that size?”
She paused. “The ‘f’ word.”
“Fuck?”
“Faggot.” The very word made her purse her lips. “May I have your glasses?” She took them, gave them a quick cleaning on her shirt, and held them out to him.
He reached for her hand holding the paper towel, but she quickly pulled away. He was startled by her reaction. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean anything by it,” he said. “I should go. Thank you for your care and time.” He put his glasses back on, then got up and walked to the door.
She was still holding the bloodied paper towel as he closed the door behind him. Her head fell back. “Oh, good Christ,” she said, disappointed in herself. “Let it go!” she whispered.
Once she’d quickly washed the dirty coffee cup from that morning and rinsed herself off in front of the sink, she fell onto the bed. The sounds of New York City outside her window had finally become familiar to her. That was not what kept her from relaxing. The image of his face kept returning to her. Allen was beautiful. He’s gay. She punched her pillow in hopes of making it more comfortable and closed her eyes. Tomorrow is Saturday. She began a mental list of things to do. Things like laundry and groceries and such needed to be done. But then, she heard his laugh in her head. Her eyes opened, and she sighed. There will not be much in the way of sleep tonight. “Happy birthday to me,” she whispered.
Chapter 2
It was nearly noon when she opened her eyes. A light knock on the door startled her. She jumped out of bed and put on her robe.
“Who’s there?”
“I have a delivery for Miss Grant,” a deep voice said.
“Miss Grant?” she whispered, and then it clicked. “Hold on.” Grabbing her bag off the floor, she searched inside until she found a quarter at the bottom. Pulling the door open just a crack, she could see an enormous assortment of purple and white flowers. She opened it wide enough to take them. Slowly, the bouquet lowered, and Allen’s eyes came into view. He playfully batted them at her.
She laughed. “What’s this?”
“It’s just a modest gift in appreciation of your bravery. Also…” He handed her a large, beautifully wrapped box. She took it from him.
“Come on in, please. You didn’t have to do this.”
He placed the flowers on the tiny table, then turned to her. After adjusting his glasses against his nose, Allen stood with his hands behind his back. His skin-tight, shiny black jeans flared out into a modest bell. The shoes looked like women’s leather square-toed chunky-heeled pumps, but he made them look great. The tan tank top was sheer enough that the hair on his chest and the outline of his nipples were evident. Around his neck he wore a slender black leather tie that was loosened and hung low on his chest. The knot itself was strange. A black silk scarf was wrapped several times around his left wrist and tied, leaving the ends hanging about six inches.
She sat on the bed, pulled off the wrapping, and lifted the lid. Inside was a proper first aid kit, a sewing kit complete with scissors, and a few smaller tools complete with two kinds of screwdrivers, a tape measure, pliers and an adjustable wrench.
“This is too much!”
He sat near her and took out an ‘L’ shaped piece of metal and examined it. “What is this?”
“It’s an Allen wrench,” she laughed. His smile disappeared, and he placed it back in the box. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to….” Tentatively, she patted his shoulder and rose from the bed. “Would you like a cup of coffee? All I have is instant.” She clutched her robe at the neck and started to open one of the two cabinets.
“I was hoping I could take you out for a bite. It’s a lovely day. We could walk a bit if you’d like.” Mel did not answer. “We could take a cab if you prefer.”
“I…I don’t have any clean clothes. Today is laundry day for me. Can I take a raincheck?” she finally asked, not meeting his eye as her face reddened.
“Well, this is all too perfect! How long will it take for you to put on whatever you would have worn to the laundromat? In 15 minutes, I’ll have a cab out front, alright?”
“I don’t…”
“Please?” He held out his hand. She looked down, smiled and swatted her fingertips with his.
“Alright, then. Meet me outside in fifteen minutes,” Allen said with a smile. Just before he closed the door, he looked back at her, flashed that incredible smile again, and gave a quick nod in a way that somehow relaxed any of her suspicious feelings.
She lifted a pair of hip huggers from the top of a pile of clothes in her closet and shook them out. Her only clean shirt was a lilac sleeveless turtleneck her brother made for her. She brushed her teeth with one hand and ran her fingers through her thick hair with the other. Laying out two pieces of bread on the counter, she assembled a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. She rinsed out the paper coffee cup she’d saved from the day before and filled it with milk. The lid still fit. There were far too many beautiful flowers in her bouquet not to share. She chose three cosmoses, cut the stems, and set them in a little water-filled jelly jar. Splashing water on her face, she looked at her reflection in the aged mirror on the wall. As ready as I’ll ever be. Taking a deep breath, Melanie slung her bag over her shoulder. She tried to walk calmly down the three flights of stairs.
Through the dirty front door window, she could see Allen leaning on a cab, chatting with the driver. Just then, a tall blonde man walked by them. Both heads swiveled, taking a long look at his ass. She had to chuckle.
“I’d check that out myself,” she whispered.
The day was quite a bit cooler than the day before. Allen took a cigarette from his pocket, along with a gold lighter. As he lit up, he saw Melanie walking toward him. She turned to the homeless man sitting up against the building. “Fred, here’s a little something to eat. Would you save me the glass?” He reached out for the paper bag and cup. With his free hand, he took hers and kissed it. Mumbling something unintelligible to her, she smiled and gave him the flowers.
He placed them up against his leg, cupped his hand around the glass and admired his gift.
A breeze drifted down the street. Melanie’s nipples shriveled from the cold air. Her knee-jerk reaction was to draw her arms up to her chest. Allen noticed and immediately felt embarrassed for her.
A policeman walked by them and stopped to observe Allen. He grabbed Mel’s hand, opened the door to the cab, and helped her in. Walking to the other side, Allen kept an eye on him. He tipped an imaginary cap to the officer and climbed inside. “Broome and Mercer,” he directed and turned to her. “You are adorable!” he said, smiling at Mel. The cabbie stared at him through the rearview mirror.
“Where were you coming from last night?” he asked her.
“My job. I didn’t ask you how your head is.”
He smiled. “It’s fine. Where do you work?”
“In the evenings, I clean some of the buildings at NYU.” She lifted his hair away from the cut. Clicking her tongue at the sight of the half dollar sized bruise developing, she asked, “Did you ice this?”
“No. How old are you?”
“20. And you?”
“24. Where are you from originally?”
“Upstate New York. A tiny town no one’s ever heard of.”
“Is that where you learned to fight?” he asked with a smile.
The color seemed to drain from her face. A silence hung between them until the cab hit a pothole that sent them both leaning hard to the right. She caught Allen as he fell against her.
Her loud, nervous laugh made its debut, and it certainly could draw attention.
“Oh my! Well, I love that sound!” he said.
The cab pulled over and made a hard stop. “Broome and Mercer, Mr. Shandi.” Allen’s tight pants forced him to lean to the left awkwardly. Jamming his right hand in his front pocket, he retrieved a bundle of bills. Mel glanced down at his hands. The bulge to the left of the bottom of his zipper caught her off guard. She very quickly looked away. He gave the cabbie a $5 tip.
“Thank you, Mr. Shandi!” His hand began to tremble as he put his money away. She took notice, and he caught that. He exited, went to her side of the cab and opened the door. Offering her his left hand, he helped her climb out.
“Are you hungry? I’m hungry. Let’s get lunch. My treat,” he said, looking across the street. He grabbed her hand and they sprinted through the traffic. Horns began honking, and a few cars stopped short. He held his hand up in a thanks gesture. She loved the way his hair bounced as he trotted. They entered a narrow eatery. A decidedly gay man welcomed Allen.
“Mr. Shandi, it’s so good to see you again. Your table is ready.” Other couples that had been waiting were not regulars or did not carry the same weight as Allen. She did not know what to make of this.
They were seated across from one another in a dark and quiet corner. Paper menus were brought to the table by a pretty young lady. “What can I get you to drink, Mr. Shandi?” she asked in a coquettish manner. She reached past Melanie’s face to light the candle and replaced the dirty ashtray with a clean one.
“What would you like, Mel?”
No one had called her that in at least five years.
“Coffee please, with milk?” she asked, looking at the waitress.
“I’ll have the same.”
The waitress placed her hand on his shoulder and said, “You’ve got it, Honey.” She walked away with quite a sway in her hips. Mel grinned and looked over to see Allen reaching for her over the table. He took a lock of her curly hair and rolled it between his fingers.
“If mermaids were real, this is the kind of hair they would have.”
She laughed as her face turned red. “Wow. I’ve never heard that before.” The art that was curiously placed up against the wall caught her eye. One piece in particular stood out. “Take a peek at that one! It’s a kaleidoscope!” She turned her attention back to his face. He’d been staring at her. Feeling embarrassed, she pretended to go over the menu. “Where are you from?” Mel asked.
“I’m not an interesting person,” he said while lighting a cigarette. “Would you like one?” he offered.
“No, thanks. I don’t want to hear your deepest, darkest secrets. How about, what do you do for a living? I feel like I’m the only one not in on it. Everybody knows you. I’ve lived here for five months, and I have no idea what you do or why you are so,” she paused, “beloved.”
“Beloved. That’s interesting.” He propped up his elbow on the table, and he rested his chin in his hand. The smoke from his cigarette curled up around his face. She sat back in the chair and crossed her ankle over her knee. Lacing her fingers together, she rested her hands in her lap. Giving him an “I’ve got all day” look, she took a deep breath.
Tapping his cigarette on the ashtray, he asked, “Have you ever heard of a clothing line called ‘Cleo’?”
“Yes. Do you work for her?”
“Well, I am her, so to speak. I named it after a knot I created for a necktie.” He pointed to the one that hung from his neck. It almost appeared to be a braid, and yet it was not. “The business has been open for three and a half years. It was perfect timing for my vision of what young women wanted. And the rest as they say…” he laughed, waving his cigarette in the air.
The waitress returned with the coffee. “Have you decided what you’d like to eat?” she asked, staring directly at Allen.
“Not really. Can we have a few more minutes?”
“Sure, Honey,” she answered and sashayed away, stopping once to look over her shoulder at Allen. But his thoughts were elsewhere.
“Have you always known you were…a visionary?” Mel asked as she stirred her coffee.
Allen glanced around to see if anyone was within earshot. He whispered, “What exactly are you asking?”
“My brother made this top for me. Not really my style, but he made it with love.” She gently touched the gauzy fabric around her neck. “Ben knew he was gay from the time he was a little boy,” Mel said softly. Her eyes welled up. “My mother simply ignored that fact. My father had an altogether different take on Ben. The things he would punish him for, well, it would just break your heart. That bastard took off in 1965. Good riddance.”
“Where is Ben now?”
“Buried in the Oswegatchie Cemetery outside of Fine, NY. Fine, NY! Funny, huh?” she laughed to cover the sadness.
More customers had begun to fill the place. The waitress returned once more. “What will it be?” she asked.
“Mel?” he asked.
She kept her head down and asked, “May I have a burger?” A tear rolled down her nose and fell on the menu.
“I’ll have the same,” he said. The waitress jotted it down as she walked away.
He gave Mel his napkin. “Dry your eyes, Sweetness,” then moved to a chair next to her and put his arm around her shoulders. “There are souls that are just too beautiful for this world,” he whispered in her ear. She had thought the very same thing a thousand times.
Two gay teens cautiously approached the table. Mel looked up. “Your fans, Mr. S! If you’ll excuse me…” The young men nearly levitated over a chance to chat with Allen. He watched her walk through a narrow doorway and into the restroom.
Splashing a little water on her face, she looked at her reflection. Her hands gripped the sides of the sink. “Pull it together,” she whispered to herself. Once she’d collected herself with a few deep breaths, she headed back to the table. She stopped and watched Allen as he spoke to them. He listened carefully as they replied and talked about their dreams.
Allen was leaning forward, elbows on his knees and speaking softly. He was incredibly patient as he explained what it took to get where he was. His enormous smile was evidence that he seemed to enjoy this part of his celebrity.
She leaned against the door frame, legs crossed at the ankles, her arms crossed just below her chest.
The two teens stood close to each other. For a second, their pinkies hooked together. Allen grinned. Removing the scarf from his wrist, he tied it around the wrist of the young man on the left, then lifted the tie from his neck and put it on the other fan. He held out his hand to shake theirs.
An older couple seated at a nearby table shook their heads in disapproval. Mel stood and stared at them for a moment, then turned her back and obstructed their view. The boys practically pogoed over to her.
“Johnny, isn’t he amazing?” the shorter of the two asked his boyfriend.
He grinned at Mel and said, “He’s amazing!”
“He certainly is,” she replied. The boys left overwhelmed with joy about what had just happened.
The burgers arrived at the table as Mel sat back down. “Thank you,” she said to the waitress and tried to make eye contact.
Finally, she looked at Mel and said, “You’re welcome.”
“Those kids will be living on that for a long time. That’s just about the sweetest thing I have ever seen,” she told him.
“I could say that about what you did for the guy sitting in front of your building earlier, but I won’t. Mine was sweeter.”
Her laugh reached the customers near the front door. “Sorry,” she said, covering her mouth, trying to muffle the sound. “You are a brat!”
“The boys’ names are Jon and Johnny. Isn’t that sweet? They’re hoping to open a clothing store in the village.” As he set his coffee cup on the saucer, his hand trembled again, rattling both. “Don’t ever apologize for your laugh. I like people that let their emotions out. I’d hate to think what would happen if you tried to hold that inside. It could be catastrophic! Your eyes and brain would be scattered everywhere!” he nearly shrilled, while his hand swiped through the air as if he were carrying a tray of filled coffee cups.
She was about to ask him about his hand, but he stood, excused himself, and headed toward the restroom. His hand, his life. It was quite simply none of her business.
When he returned, they continued to talk for another hour or so. Allen had participated in the Stonewall riots and Mel wanted to learn about every scrap of it.
“I witnessed the woman, Storme DeLarverie, fighting the cops. Some aren’t sure it was her, but I’m convinced it was. When she yelled out to us, ‘Why don’t you guys do something?’ we all went crazy. I guess we all have a boiling point.”
“Truer words, my friend. Ben wanted so much to be a part of it. He never hid who he was. All he ever wanted was to work for, well, someone exactly like you. Damn, you would have loved him,” she said, leaning back in her chair.
“The mob and the cops were involved in the whole thing. Talk about an uphill battle. At that time, the lesbians, queens and gays were not exactly a team.”
“Really? You’d think people treating all of you like dirt would be enough to pull everyone together,” she said.
“Well, to be fair, I’ve seen the same sort of division in the women’s movement.”
“You’re right.” She paused and said, “Things are going to change. They’ve got to. We have no control over who we fall in love with.” She lit one of the two cigarettes she had left. “Would you like one?” she offered. He waved it off. “Do you have somebody special in your life?” she asked.
“Yes, I do. A man named Christopher.” Allen’s eyes lit up.
“How did you meet?”
“Everyone thinks we met at a fashion show. We met while waiting for a cab. Long story short, we ended up sharing one and kept on sharing.”
“How long are the two of you together?”
“Almost a year,” he answered with a smile.
“How did you know it was love?”
“Oh, good Lord. How does anyone ever truly know? I wish I could say that it was love at first sight. Like a bolt of lightning jabbing me in the heart and I would never be the same. I think that’s bull. It never happens that way. How about you? Is there someone special?”
“No,” she said, stood and tossed her bag over her shoulder. She sighed as she thought about the bill. “I don’t even have enough money for a decent tip. I promise I will pay you back.” As she passed the kaleidoscope painting, she stopped to take a closer look but gasped when she saw the price.
He stood and tossed a few bills on the table. As he passed the waitress, he shoved a few additional bills into her pocket. “Thank you, dear.” She smiled at him, then continued to pour coffee into another young man’s cup, flirting away with her latest customer.
It felt good to have something substantial in her stomach for a change. As they left the eatery and headed north, a sophisticated man walked toward them. His Dobermann ignored the noises around him. “Geeze. Check out this beautiful beast,” she gushed. “Excuse me. May I pet him?” she asked the gentleman.
“He can be skittish,” he replied.
Mel held her hand out palm down. She let the dog take its time sniffing, and then she turned her hand over. He began to lick her fingers.
“Well, I’ll be,” said the man.
“My trick is to let them smell me when I just finished eating,” she joked. The gentleman chuckled as he and his pet went on with their walk.
“You like dogs?” Allen asked.
“To be honest, I love them. Dogs are such wonderful creatures. They love you no matter what. That’s hard to find.”
“Let me get a cab.” There were none in sight. While they waited at the curb, a policeman began to cross the street and headed toward them. Allen shoved his hand into his pockets and quietly asked, “Would you take my arm?”
Mel did not realize what was happening but did what he had asked. It was then that she noticed the officer. Mel laid her head on his shoulder and focused her gaze on a couple window shopping across the street. Once he had passed, she removed her arm from his. “I hate that fucking shit,” she hissed. Allen looked down at her face. Her eyes were blazing. He waved down an approaching cab, and they piled in.
“You can’t let it get to you,” he said in a matter-of fact kind of way. He turned his attention to the cabbie and said, “West Central Park and 69th.” This time, she accepted when he offered a cigarette.
Pulling her hair back, she leaned into the lighter’s flame. She sighed. “I’m not able to pay for anything, and it’s driving me nuts. I’m embarrassed,” and sighed again. “As soon as I…”
“Later, OK?” he asked and patted her hand.
She could not help but look up at all the high-reaching buildings that stood in Manhattan. “I can never get over just how immense this place is.” Her head was just about upside down, trying to get the best possible view.
“Yes. You are adorable.” She didn’t hear him. The city and all its energy had her full attention. Allen turned to the gorgeous driver. When they arrived at his address, the cabbie thanked Allen for the tip. He also handed him a slip of paper with his name and number on it.
Allen just smiled and put it in his pocket.
A uniformed doorman held open the heavy glass door. “Good afternoon, Mr. Shandi.”
“Hey there, George. How are Christina and the baby?”
“They are wonderful, thanks for asking.”
“Come on. You must have a picture, yes?”
With that, George pulled his wallet out of his pocket and opened it to a photo.
“Oh,” Allen said with a sigh. “Oh my gosh. They are lovely. Is Penelope about four months old now? Look at these beautiful women, Mel.”
She took the wallet. The woman in the photo looked thrilled to be a mom. Little Penelope’s toothless grin was precious. “You are a very lucky man,” she said placing her hand on her abdomen. Still smiling, she handed it back to him.
“Yes, I am.” George took a few seconds to look at the picture before putting it away.
“By the way, Christopher has taken Daphne for a walk.”
Allen gave him a wink. “Thanks, George.”
The elevator required a unique key to go to the penthouse. Mel and Allen rode it nine floors up. When the elevator doors opened, they stepped into a small area with a large door across the way. He opened it and they entered an extravagant vestibule. Mel had never seen or could even imagine such wealth. An older gentleman greeted Allen with his mail and messages.
He looked inquisitively at Melanie.
Allen said, “This is my sweet friend, Melanie. Mel, this is Quinten. If you need or want anything, this is your man.”
Mel extended her hand out to Quinten and said, “Nice to meet you.” He hesitated and looked at Allen. Allen grinned.
He took her hand and said, “It’s very nice to meet you. Would you prefer Mel or Melanie?”
“Either is fine. May I use the bathroom?”
“Of course, follow me, please.”
The bathroom was straight ahead and to the right. It was below a winding staircase with full bookshelves. Quinten lightly pressed the spine of a red and black book, and a door opened outward. Orange-yellow light spilled out onto the tiled floor.
“I’ve never actually seen a secret door. Very cool! Thank you,” she said and went inside. The dominant color was red, and the accent colors were black, gold and purple. Tiles of red with gold swirls outlined in black covered the bottom half of the walls. The upper half was crimson. She was sure the entire room was larger than her apartment. There were several black and red velvet ottomans and a purple and gold chaise lounge in a sitting area. On the other side of a half wall was the toilet and a bidet alongside it. Over the double sinks hung an enormous mirror with an ornate frame. She set her bag on the black marble counter between the sinks. As she sat on the toilet, she tried to take all of it in. “And this is just the bathroom,” she whispered. Once she’d finished, she washed her hands and raked her fingers through her hair.
Allen was waiting for her. “I’d like to show you something.” They went up the stairs and off to the left. After passing several rooms, Allen held open the door to a bedroom. She flashed him a confused expression.
“Oh! No. This isn’t one of those ‘I’d like to show you my etchings’ snares. I wanted to show you a few things from my collection. It’s through the doorway on the left.”
She did not budge. “Wait here,” he said and disappeared into that room. As he came back, he draped pieces of clothing on hangers across the bed. Spreading them out, he chose a backless sequin-covered halter top jumpsuit in champagne gold. “Isn’t this scrumptious?”
“It’s dazzling. But it’s not my style.”
He looked at the remainder of what was on the bed. “That’s the second time you’ve mentioned your style. What is your style, exactly?”
“I like a less feminine look, you know? I’ve always been a tomboy,” she said timidly. “Do you design things for men?”
The sound of quickly clicking toenails on the wood floor grew louder. With that, a magnificent Rottweiler burst into the room. “Daphne-love!” gushed Allen.
Catching his breath, Christopher followed. He stood over six feet tall, blonde hair parted on the right and trimmed with precision. Although he was slender, he was muscular the way 20-year-old men often are. “I’m back from our daily tug. She is going to pull my arm out one of these days,” he said.
Daphne’s interest shifted to the new scent in the room. Her full tail swished back and forth as she sniffed Mel’s feet and legs.
“Who is this?” Christopher asked, inspecting Mel.
She stuck out her hand, “I’m Mel Foster.” He hesitated for a moment, then took her hand. “It’s very nice to meet you,” she said. Still looking at Christopher, she asked, “Daphne’s tail is intact? I don’t think I’ve ever seen that. She’s a beauty.”
“We got her when she was a pup, and we specifically told them not to do that. It’s unthinkable,” Allen huffed.
Mel was on her knees, along with Christopher, cuddling and scratching her belly. “We had a large dog when I was little. Just a mutt, but at least 100 pounds. My father found a harness for her and it helped when we had to walk her.” Daphne jumped onto Mel knocking her back with her legs folded under her and began licking her face. Mel laughed and hugged her around the neck.
“Daphne!” Allen laughed. “Come! Come here, my girl.” She obediently went to his side.
“May I have a washcloth or something?” Mel asked once Allen had lured Daphne away.
Christopher answered, “Sure.” Mel followed him out of the bedroom and down the hall.
“Second door on the left,” he said with a forced smile.
She pushed the door, but it did not close all the way. Splashing her face with warm soap and water removed the drool from her face. Two black velvet ottomans placed side by side with a tiny table between were in the corner. She sat and took advantage of the small, crystal ashtray. Digging through her bag, she retrieved her last cigarette, matches and a hair clip. Taking a deep drag, she grabbed everything and went to the mirror. With the cigarette hanging from her mouth, she pulled her thick hair and piled it on the crown of her head. The extra-large leather slide barely fit over her mop of curls. She pushed the stick through the holes to secure everything in place. Invariably, five or six tendrils hung down around her neck, dripping down over her back and shoulders. She could hear a discussion growing louder coming from the bedroom. “She will end up becoming just another fag-hag for you. What is this, the fifth? I do not need yet another person hanging around watching us as if you and I were a freakshow,” Christopher said firmly.
“You are wrong about her. She’s one of us. Her ideas about women’s clothing are perfect for what’s down the road,” said Allen.
“Is that how you met her?” There was a pause.
Trying to make her presence known, Mel tugged the door open and stomped heavily onto the floor. Daphne flounced toward her. “I’m going to have to get going, little girl.” Holding either side of her enormous head, she kissed her loudly.
“Your hair. I love it!” declared Allen. “I have a proposal for you, Mel. You brought up a more masculine feel for women’s clothing. Would you help me bring that idea to life?” Allen asked.
“I don’t know the first thing about fashion.”
Christopher laughed, “You’ve got that right.”
“Now, now. Let’s not be bitchy,” said Allen.
Mel motioned toward Christopher while looking at Allen and said, “He understands that I do not…”
“Sometimes, all you need to know is what you like and what you don’t like,” said Allen. “Like art.” He grabbed her hand and led her to the back of the bedroom. After opening the double-door walk-in closet, he began to look through his clothes. He chose a white button-down shirt from his closet. “What would you do with this?” He held it out to her. His right arm was across his chest and was clutching his left bicep. His forearm extended outward with the palm of his hand facing the ceiling, and the shirt dangled from his fingertip. She would come to know this as his “What say you?” pose.
“Seriously?” She exhaled. Taking the shirt from him, she hung it from an indentation on one of the columns of the four-poster bed. Christopher gasped at the thought of damage done to the tiger maple column. “I would make it sleeveless and shorten the front to waist length.” She turned it around. Christopher stepped in and held it for her. “Thanks, Christopher. It could be darted a bit to fit my form, then lengthened the shirttail to fall just passed the…” she patted her rear.
“Ass?” Christopher asked. Allen gave him a look.
“Well, I was gonna say cheeks, but either fit. Split it up the middle to about two inches below the waistline. It would end up kind of like tails on a tux. If you could give it lapels rather than a collar, I think that would be something I’d like.”
“What would you wear with it?” asked Allen.
Taking a moment to think, she finally said, “I would wear straight leg jeans and man boots up to my knees. You know, the kind that you tie up in the front without the spiky heels.”
Allen looked over at Christopher and said, “Do you see what I mean?”
“Do you design clothes also, Christopher?”
He seemed insulted by the question. “I am a model,” he answered in a sharp tone.
“I’m sorry. I don’t read many magazines.” Pointing out her appearance with gesturing hands, she laughed, “Just look at me for crying out loud!”
“I have to give you that,” Christopher said.
“Honey, that’s not…” Allen started to say.
“But it’s funny and appropriate,” answered Mel. “Allen, thanks for all of this. I’ve got to get going.”
A nearly palpable look went from Allen to Christopher. Christopher shrugged his shoulders and said, “OK,” and he left the room.
“This might be forward, but I…we wondered if you would consider staying with us while we take Cleo in this new direction? This place has several empty rooms. But I think you’d truly love the one on the far end.”
“But I haven’t agreed to the clothing thing.”
He ignored her. She followed him to an enormous room down the hallway. Daphne’s toenails let them know she was right behind them. Everything was covered with sheets except the king-size bed. Sliding glass doors on the far side of the room led to a balcony complete with greenery and furniture. The walls were white, and the furniture was in varying shades of red. As the sun fell low in the sky, it cast a fantastic orangey-pink over everything around her, including Allen.
“Isn’t it gorgeous?”
“Yes, but I have a job,” she said.
He came toward her and held her by the shoulders. “This is an opportunity to grow. It will be your job. Name your price.” She was only aware of his hands on her. Everything else was a blur. “Please?” he asked, batting his eyes again. Allen bent down a bit to meet her eye and was inches from her face. “I need you.”
She paused, then finally said, “Yes. Thank you. Allen, I am so grateful…” but the lump in her throat and tears squelched her ability to speak.
Allen threw his arms around her and she pulled away just a bit. He laughed and said, “I’m sorry. I excite easily!”
“Good to know,” she said, patting him on the back. He laughed into her ear. The sensation of his breath on her neck was incredible and alarming at once. “I have one request.”
“Name it.”
She pulled back and placed her hands on his chest. “I am not a huggee, cuddly, touchy-feely person. Please, don’t take it the wrong way. You are such a great guy, a real gentleman. You would never deliberately hurt anyone. It just makes me uncomfortable.”
He looked into her eyes. “Of course, I can respect that.” He backed away. “I understand, you know. Maybe better than most. I was different, too.” She felt light-headed.
“Are you alright?” he asked.
“Yes. I think I need a shower and a good night’s sleep.”
“Can I have Quinten bring you a bite to eat?”
“No, not right now. If I get hungry, I’ll poke around the kitchen, if that’s OK.”
“It’s fine with me, but Quinten gets a bit touchy when his domain is disturbed.”
“I promise I’ll clean up after myself,” she offered.
“Good Lord, woman, I was joking! Feel free to have anything you’d like.” He left her room and closed the door behind him.
Chapter 3
By the next morning, all of Mel’s belongings had been picked up and delivered to the penthouse. That afternoon, Allen purchased a month’s worth of clothing for her right down to her panties, along with a carton of her favorite cigarettes plus several joints. She sat on the edge of the bed surrounded by all of it, including the jelly jar she’d given to Fred and her prized possession. It was an old lockbox. Taking the key out of her bag, she placed the box on her lap and opened it slowly. Lifting the three photographs of her brother, Benjamin, from inside, she traced his face with her finger. It also contained a spool of fishing line. She looked up to see Allen standing in the doorway. She closed the box and set it aside.
“Would you like a hand putting things away?” he asked.
“I can’t accept all of this.”
“Consider it an advance,” he said. “Anything you dislike will be returned, exchanged, whatever.” He walked toward her.
Mel stood and moved toward the middle of the room. “You could have let my friend keep the glass,” she remarked.
“I did something a little better, I think. I hope you agree. Fred now occupies your old apartment, and I’ve paid up for two years. He has several new outfits, a bit of cash, and will be filling in at your old job until you decide what you want to do. I will find another place for you to live if you think this isn’t working out, but I want you to share your ideas with me,” he said in a serious tone.
She turned away from him. “I’m going to do my very best for you. Thank you for giving me this chance.”
He moved toward her, then thought better of it. Quinten knocked on the door frame.
“Excuse me, Sir. How many for dinner tonight?”
“Six, I think. Very casual, OK?” Allen asked.
“Time?”
“Six-thirty.”
“Is there anything, in particular, you would like tonight, Sir?”
“Mel, if you sat down in a restaurant and could have anything you wanted, what would it be?” Allen asked her.
She chuckled. “I feel as if I’m in a dream, or I’m high. Maybe I’ve died and gone to Heaven.” She asked timidly, “Do you like spaghetti and meatballs and maybe a salad?”
“Perfect. Is that doable, Quinten?”
“Of course, Sir. Can I get you anything in the meantime, Miss Melanie?”
“No thanks, and for God’s sake, drop the Miss. You make me feel as if I’m the character in ‘Gone with the Wind’! Or worse, my mother.”
“Quinten, could you give us a minute?”
“Of course,” he said and went downstairs.
Allen sat on the bench at the foot of the bed. His legs crossed at the knee and leaning back on his hands. “Did I tell you how I ended up living here?” he asked Mel. She shook her head, no. He gestured with his hand for her to sit next to him. She sat beside him with her legs apart, her elbows resting on her thighs and hands folded. He brushed her hair over her shoulder.
“I just want to see your face, OK?”
“Yes,” she answered and looked at him.
“My father owned an oil conglomerate. It doesn’t matter which one. They are all greed-factories. He could buy and sell God, or so he said. The best part is that God got the last laugh. One morning he told his secretary that there were to be no phone calls, no interruptions. He had a massive heart attack at his desk while she typed away just outside his door. Side note, she was also his mistress. An hour and a half later, she poked her head in to ask a question. She found him sweat-soaked and face down in a pool of his vomit. The Man upstairs is a funny guy, don’t you agree?”
“I gather you were not close to him?”
“No one was. My father loved money and fucking women. If he could have figured out a way to bang them with a roll of hundreds on his cock, it would have been his ejaculation of a lifetime.”
“Wow,” she chuckled. “How did your mom take it?”
“Poor thing, she loved him and not for his money. She would tell me about the 19-year-old boy she’d met all those years ago. Generous, kind, hardworking and very gentle with her. Somewhere along the line, he soured. He began drinking to excess and worse, hitting her. He became ruthless.”
“Did he know you are gay?”
“I think if he’d spent just a bit of time with me, he would have. But you must be in the same room with a person, look into their eyes, listen to what they say to learn anything. My wonderful mother died two years after my father. Countless homes, cars, all kinds of ‘things’ had become the property of my brother and me. Did I tell you I have a brother? Keith. Funny guy. A good man. Anyway. He and I sold most of it and gave the money to charities for the homeless, hospitals, but the best was handing out money to anyone that looked like they could use it. We knew this would make the old bastard roll in his grave. Even better, we made the donations in his name.”
“Ooooh, you scoundrels. I love it,” she laughed.
“Quinten has been with our family since before I was born. He is an old-fashioned gentleman’s gentleman. He just can’t help himself. I know for certain there were times that he would intercept when that bastard was after my mom. He’d lie and say there was a phone call or news on TV about my father’s company. My father was so drunk he probably could have distracted him with a ring of keys, …like an infant. All that being said, Quinten is who he is, and we accept him that way. Alright?”
Her face was beet red. “Yes. Understood. I’ll make it right.” She looked back on the bed and asked, “I hate to sound like such a girl, but what are you wearing tonight?”
Allen laughed. “How do jeans and a shirt sound? Shoes are optional.”
“Comfortable, thank you.”
Allen’s chef, Wyatt Edmonds, had taken the time to ask Mel about her selection for dinner, right down to the amount of garlic or basil. He stood at six foot four and two hundred forty pounds of muscle. He looked extremely intimidating, but that turned out to be completely wrong. He was a gentle and soft-spoken man. It was moving to see his interest in what would make her happy.
That evening, softly playing jazz hung in the background. Allen and Christopher were in one of two black loveseats in a cozy area of the living room. The other loveseat was directly across from them, with two red high-back chairs between them facing the fireplace. A black lacquered coffee table sat between it all.
The first to arrive were two women that worked in the garment district. Eric had red cropped hair and was wearing a man’s blue button-down shirt tucked into her black jeans with a matching blue belt and sneakers.
Mel asked Eric, “May I ask, do you consider yourself a ‘he’ or ‘she’?”
“He, and thank you for asking.” His girlfriend, Meghan also had red hair, but shoulder length. She wore a short denim skirt, a red sweater and black high heels. After the introductions, Allen offered drinks. Eric would have his usual Pabst Blue Ribbon beer in a pint glass while Meghan preferred white wine. Rather than help, Christopher called out for a vodka and tonic. As Allen gave Eric and Meghan their drinks, he heard the elevator door open and excused himself. Mel went to the bar to make Christopher’s drink. She brought it to him and asked, “What do you think Allen will have?”
“I have no idea,” he answered, not meeting her eyes.
“Mel, meet Zora Preston. She is a buyer for one of the high-end stores on 5th Avenue. Zora, Mel Foster.”
She was a tall, curvy African American woman with a beautiful, giant Afro. She wore a tight-fitting, sleeveless black turtleneck sweater, large gold hoop earrings and a floor-length striped skirt in all the colors of the rainbow. Mel smiled and shook her hand. “Do you prefer Mel or Melanie?” Zora asked in a soft and sexy voice.
“Either is fine.”
“Then, Melanie, it is.”
“Your hair is gorgeous!” Mel gushed.
“As is yours,” she responded, taking a handful and twirling it between her fingers.
“I told her just how beautiful you are, Mel. And did I lie?” Allen asked, holding his hands to her like the statuesque women on game shows would when displaying a new car.
Mel became an entirely new shade of red. “Allen, please.” She laughed and turned to Zora. “If you know Allen at all, then you know how generous he is with his compliments. Zora, what can I get you to drink?”
“I’ll have whatever you’re having,” she smiled, putting her hand on top of Mel’s. The sound of ice cubes clinking together came from Christopher. He’d raised his glass and shook it. Allen snatched it from his hand, then he and Mel went to the bar.
“What’s going on, Allen?”
“I’m sorry for Christopher’s behavior.”
“That’s not what I meant. Why is Zora here?”
“I thought the two of you might hit it off,” he said innocently.
“Oh, good Christ,” she said, leaning on the marble surface. She closed her eyes and said, “Are you under the impression that I am a lesbian?”
“Well, yes.”
“Oh, my God,” she whispered, then laughed. “I can’t be upset with you. A tomboy is a stone’s throw from that. No, I’m not a lesbian. This beautiful woman was brought here as my date?”
“I am so sorry,” he said, thoroughly embarrassed. “Let me talk to Zora.”
“No. That’s OK. Let me,” Mel said. After handing Christopher his drink, she asked, “Zora, would you mind checking out the wine selections?”
“Not at all.”
Allen watched out of the corner of his eye as Mel placed her hand on Zora’s back. Mel smiled at her and spoke softly. A look of confusion came across Zora’s face as Mel spoke but quickly changed to a warm smile. Zora placed her hand on Mel’s. She kissed her on the forehead and, with her thumb, wiped the lipstick it left behind. Their attention turned to the wine. Mel laughed loudly at something Zora said. Christopher smirked at Mel. “Idiot,” he said under his breath. Allen shot him a look.
The evening continued as if nothing had happened. The dining room table was set, complete with two flower arrangements. Allen and Christopher sat at opposite ends of the table. Eric and Meghan sat on one side and Mel and Zora on the other.
Mel asked Eric, “How long have you two been together?”
Eric lifted Meghan’s hand from under the table and kissed it. “Two years. The first time I saw Meghan, I was hooked. I couldn’t take my eyes off her. Then she turned and looked at me and smiled. I couldn’t believe it. Everything came into focus. People say things like the sky is bluer, the birds sing more sweetly, and that is the truth. She was just what I needed in my life,” Eric said and leaned in for a kiss.

PART ONE — HER STYLE
Chapter 1—September 6th, 1972
The night breeze was a welcome sensation after spending six hours working up a sweat cleaning one of the NYU buildings off Washington Square. This seedy side of town always put Melanie on edge. The drenched bandana covering her hair would stay in place until she was safely back in her room. Reaching into her purple bag, she found her keys. Before putting one foot on the sidewalk, she made sure the keys were spread apart and protruding between her fingers.
The walk to the Village Plaza Hotel took as long as smoking one cigarette, three quarters if she was nervous. Three drags in, she heard a low, angry voice. A lighter voice responded as if confused. In the darkness of a doorway off to the left, Melanie could make out a large man hanging over a smaller person.
“Faggot, yer gonna get yer fuckin’ ass kicked,” he growled while raising his massive fist back over his shoulder. It was then that Mel realized the smaller person was a man trying to cover his head with his hands.
Quickly, she stepped toward them. “Honey, where have you been?” she asked, pulling the bandana off her head. The growler, still clenching his fist, turned to look at her. For just a few seconds, he stared at her. Her dirty bell-bottoms and loosely fitting t-shirt covering her slender body did not distract him from the long, curly-cue, strawberry blonde hair that framed her beautiful face and fell to her elbows. With one hand on her hip, she flicked the cigarette to the side. For a fleeting moment, the only sounds were a few crickets communicating with each other. She took that time to smile and step toward him. When she was close enough to see him begin to smile back, her right arm swung around, connecting with his left cheek and eye. The punch itself was not remarkable, but the keys split his face and it had begun to bleed. He lost his balance just enough to allow her to finish the job by kneeing him in the groin. He yelped in pain as he fell over, clutching his crotch. Placing her arm under the light voiced man’s arm, she brought him to his feet.
All he could do was stare at her. Not for her hair and sweet face, but because he was dumbstruck. He’d seen only one other woman fight like that.
Grabbing his hand, they ran down Washington Place. Twice, she looked back to see if the beast was behind them. Tugging him to the right, they ran into the hotel. The man behind the desk in the lobby yelled, “Where are you going?”
“It’s me, Melanie, Mr. Jones.” The three flights of stairs took the last of her energy. Looking back over her shoulder, she felt a little safer. She had not let go of his hand. At times, he’d run right beside her, others ahead of her. They stopped on the third floor. She let go of him and bent over, hands on her knees, trying to catch her breath. With a sweeping motion, she tossed her hair back and stood upright. In front of her darkened doorway, she finally looked over at him. Once her eyes adjusted to the light, she saw his face. In the shadows of a dimly lit bare bulb screwed into the ceiling, she could see his smile. He leaned against the wall with his hand shaking against his chest.
“You’ll be OK,” she tried to say in a calm voice.
His long, dark brown, shiny hair fell in layers just below his shoulders. A pair of Aviator prescription glasses rested on his significant and masculine nose. Eyeliner enhanced his almond-shaped brown eyes and long lashes. Her eyes fell to his mouth, and she couldn’t help but stare at his lips. They were the kind that made women jealous. Both the top and bottom were full. The deep dimples were like perpetual parentheses on the edges of that extraordinary mouth. Once he stood up straight, Melanie guessed he was only a few inches taller than her, putting him at about 5’11”. A bead of blood rolled down over his eyelid.
“Looks like he got a punch in.” She handed him a tissue from her bag, put her blood-covered door key in the worn lock and opened it. He followed her inside.
The kitchen was no more than an area in the otherwise Lilliputian room. She pulled the only chair from the tiny table and motioned for him to sit.
“What’s your name?” she asked as she rinsed off her keys.
“Allen. Shandi.”
She smiled. “Like the beer?”
“No,” he smiled, “as in boisterous.” He looked around the room. It was shabby but clean. Not like anything he’d ever experienced. “And what is your name? I heard you say, ‘Melanie.’”
“Yeah. Melanie. Mel. Foster.”
“As in cultivate?”
“Nah. Like the Grant’s.”
His laugh was light and feminine. Mel pulled a small container from under the twin bed and put it on the threadbare rug next to him. Inside was an assortment of necessities. It contained a sewing needle stuck in a spool of white thread, a hammer, a box of band-aids, a roll of tape, and a small glass container of hydrogen peroxide. She retrieved a band-aid and the bottle.
“Would you take off your glasses, please?”
“Truth be told, my vision is horrible. I can only see about a foot in front of me without them,” he told her.
“I’d like to clean out that cut. That bastard was filthy. It wouldn’t surprise me if you caught something just by breathing in the same space as that creep did. Your glasses could use a wipe, too.” He removed them and tilted his head towards her. “This might sting a bit,” Mel warned. She lifted his thick hair away from his forehead. The aroma of pot and sandalwood floated up to her and it made her smile. She lightly patted his head with a paper towel with the tiniest bit of hydrogen peroxide.
“Jesus!” He winced.
“I’m sorry,” she said, and blew on the cut.
“I haven’t thanked you for saving me from that Neanderthal. What would ever make you go after something that size?”
She paused. “The ‘f’ word.”
“Fuck?”
“Faggot.” The very word made her purse her lips. “May I have your glasses?” She took them, gave them a quick cleaning on her shirt, and held them out to him.
He reached for her hand holding the paper towel, but she quickly pulled away. He was startled by her reaction. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean anything by it,” he said. “I should go. Thank you for your care and time.” He put his glasses back on, then got up and walked to the door.
She was still holding the bloodied paper towel as he closed the door behind him. Her head fell back. “Oh, good Christ,” she said, disappointed in herself. “Let it go!” she whispered.
Once she’d quickly washed the dirty coffee cup from that morning and rinsed herself off in front of the sink, she fell onto the bed. The sounds of New York City outside her window had finally become familiar to her. That was not what kept her from relaxing. The image of his face kept returning to her. Allen was beautiful. He’s gay. She punched her pillow in hopes of making it more comfortable and closed her eyes. Tomorrow is Saturday. She began a mental list of things to do. Things like laundry and groceries and such needed to be done. But then, she heard his laugh in her head. Her eyes opened, and she sighed. There will not be much in the way of sleep tonight. “Happy birthday to me,” she whispered.
Chapter 2
It was nearly noon when she opened her eyes. A light knock on the door startled her. She jumped out of bed and put on her robe.
“Who’s there?”
“I have a delivery for Miss Grant,” a deep voice said.
“Miss Grant?” she whispered, and then it clicked. “Hold on.” Grabbing her bag off the floor, she searched inside until she found a quarter at the bottom. Pulling the door open just a crack, she could see an enormous assortment of purple and white flowers. She opened it wide enough to take them. Slowly, the bouquet lowered, and Allen’s eyes came into view. He playfully batted them at her.
She laughed. “What’s this?”
“It’s just a modest gift in appreciation of your bravery. Also…” He handed her a large, beautifully wrapped box. She took it from him.
“Come on in, please. You didn’t have to do this.”
He placed the flowers on the tiny table, then turned to her. After adjusting his glasses against his nose, Allen stood with his hands behind his back. His skin-tight, shiny black jeans flared out into a modest bell. The shoes looked like women’s leather square-toed chunky-heeled pumps, but he made them look great. The tan tank top was sheer enough that the hair on his chest and the outline of his nipples were evident. Around his neck he wore a slender black leather tie that was loosened and hung low on his chest. The knot itself was strange. A black silk scarf was wrapped several times around his left wrist and tied, leaving the ends hanging about six inches.
She sat on the bed, pulled off the wrapping, and lifted the lid. Inside was a proper first aid kit, a sewing kit complete with scissors, and a few smaller tools complete with two kinds of screwdrivers, a tape measure, pliers and an adjustable wrench.
“This is too much!”
He sat near her and took out an ‘L’ shaped piece of metal and examined it. “What is this?”
“It’s an Allen wrench,” she laughed. His smile disappeared, and he placed it back in the box. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to….” Tentatively, she patted his shoulder and rose from the bed. “Would you like a cup of coffee? All I have is instant.” She clutched her robe at the neck and started to open one of the two cabinets.
“I was hoping I could take you out for a bite. It’s a lovely day. We could walk a bit if you’d like.” Mel did not answer. “We could take a cab if you prefer.”
“I…I don’t have any clean clothes. Today is laundry day for me. Can I take a raincheck?” she finally asked, not meeting his eye as her face reddened.
“Well, this is all too perfect! How long will it take for you to put on whatever you would have worn to the laundromat? In 15 minutes, I’ll have a cab out front, alright?”
“I don’t…”
“Please?” He held out his hand. She looked down, smiled and swatted her fingertips with his.
“Alright, then. Meet me outside in fifteen minutes,” Allen said with a smile. Just before he closed the door, he looked back at her, flashed that incredible smile again, and gave a quick nod in a way that somehow relaxed any of her suspicious feelings.
She lifted a pair of hip huggers from the top of a pile of clothes in her closet and shook them out. Her only clean shirt was a lilac sleeveless turtleneck her brother made for her. She brushed her teeth with one hand and ran her fingers through her thick hair with the other. Laying out two pieces of bread on the counter, she assembled a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. She rinsed out the paper coffee cup she’d saved from the day before and filled it with milk. The lid still fit. There were far too many beautiful flowers in her bouquet not to share. She chose three cosmoses, cut the stems, and set them in a little water-filled jelly jar. Splashing water on her face, she looked at her reflection in the aged mirror on the wall. As ready as I’ll ever be. Taking a deep breath, Melanie slung her bag over her shoulder. She tried to walk calmly down the three flights of stairs.
Through the dirty front door window, she could see Allen leaning on a cab, chatting with the driver. Just then, a tall blonde man walked by them. Both heads swiveled, taking a long look at his ass. She had to chuckle.
“I’d check that out myself,” she whispered.
The day was quite a bit cooler than the day before. Allen took a cigarette from his pocket, along with a gold lighter. As he lit up, he saw Melanie walking toward him. She turned to the homeless man sitting up against the building. “Fred, here’s a little something to eat. Would you save me the glass?” He reached out for the paper bag and cup. With his free hand, he took hers and kissed it. Mumbling something unintelligible to her, she smiled and gave him the flowers.
He placed them up against his leg, cupped his hand around the glass and admired his gift.
A breeze drifted down the street. Melanie’s nipples shriveled from the cold air. Her knee-jerk reaction was to draw her arms up to her chest. Allen noticed and immediately felt embarrassed for her.
A policeman walked by them and stopped to observe Allen. He grabbed Mel’s hand, opened the door to the cab, and helped her in. Walking to the other side, Allen kept an eye on him. He tipped an imaginary cap to the officer and climbed inside. “Broome and Mercer,” he directed and turned to her. “You are adorable!” he said, smiling at Mel. The cabbie stared at him through the rearview mirror.
“Where were you coming from last night?” he asked her.
“My job. I didn’t ask you how your head is.”
He smiled. “It’s fine. Where do you work?”
“In the evenings, I clean some of the buildings at NYU.” She lifted his hair away from the cut. Clicking her tongue at the sight of the half dollar sized bruise developing, she asked, “Did you ice this?”
“No. How old are you?”
“20. And you?”
“24. Where are you from originally?”
“Upstate New York. A tiny town no one’s ever heard of.”
“Is that where you learned to fight?” he asked with a smile.
The color seemed to drain from her face. A silence hung between them until the cab hit a pothole that sent them both leaning hard to the right. She caught Allen as he fell against her.
Her loud, nervous laugh made its debut, and it certainly could draw attention.
“Oh my! Well, I love that sound!” he said.
The cab pulled over and made a hard stop. “Broome and Mercer, Mr. Shandi.” Allen’s tight pants forced him to lean to the left awkwardly. Jamming his right hand in his front pocket, he retrieved a bundle of bills. Mel glanced down at his hands. The bulge to the left of the bottom of his zipper caught her off guard. She very quickly looked away. He gave the cabbie a $5 tip.
“Thank you, Mr. Shandi!” His hand began to tremble as he put his money away. She took notice, and he caught that. He exited, went to her side of the cab and opened the door. Offering her his left hand, he helped her climb out.
“Are you hungry? I’m hungry. Let’s get lunch. My treat,” he said, looking across the street. He grabbed her hand and they sprinted through the traffic. Horns began honking, and a few cars stopped short. He held his hand up in a thanks gesture. She loved the way his hair bounced as he trotted. They entered a narrow eatery. A decidedly gay man welcomed Allen.
“Mr. Shandi, it’s so good to see you again. Your table is ready.” Other couples that had been waiting were not regulars or did not carry the same weight as Allen. She did not know what to make of this.
They were seated across from one another in a dark and quiet corner. Paper menus were brought to the table by a pretty young lady. “What can I get you to drink, Mr. Shandi?” she asked in a coquettish manner. She reached past Melanie’s face to light the candle and replaced the dirty ashtray with a clean one.
“What would you like, Mel?”
No one had called her that in at least five years.
“Coffee please, with milk?” she asked, looking at the waitress.
“I’ll have the same.”
The waitress placed her hand on his shoulder and said, “You’ve got it, Honey.” She walked away with quite a sway in her hips. Mel grinned and looked over to see Allen reaching for her over the table. He took a lock of her curly hair and rolled it between his fingers.
“If mermaids were real, this is the kind of hair they would have.”
She laughed as her face turned red. “Wow. I’ve never heard that before.” The art that was curiously placed up against the wall caught her eye. One piece in particular stood out. “Take a peek at that one! It’s a kaleidoscope!” She turned her attention back to his face. He’d been staring at her. Feeling embarrassed, she pretended to go over the menu. “Where are you from?” Mel asked.
“I’m not an interesting person,” he said while lighting a cigarette. “Would you like one?” he offered.
“No, thanks. I don’t want to hear your deepest, darkest secrets. How about, what do you do for a living? I feel like I’m the only one not in on it. Everybody knows you. I’ve lived here for five months, and I have no idea what you do or why you are so,” she paused, “beloved.”
“Beloved. That’s interesting.” He propped up his elbow on the table, and he rested his chin in his hand. The smoke from his cigarette curled up around his face. She sat back in the chair and crossed her ankle over her knee. Lacing her fingers together, she rested her hands in her lap. Giving him an “I’ve got all day” look, she took a deep breath.
Tapping his cigarette on the ashtray, he asked, “Have you ever heard of a clothing line called ‘Cleo’?”
“Yes. Do you work for her?”
“Well, I am her, so to speak. I named it after a knot I created for a necktie.” He pointed to the one that hung from his neck. It almost appeared to be a braid, and yet it was not. “The business has been open for three and a half years. It was perfect timing for my vision of what young women wanted. And the rest as they say…” he laughed, waving his cigarette in the air.
The waitress returned with the coffee. “Have you decided what you’d like to eat?” she asked, staring directly at Allen.
“Not really. Can we have a few more minutes?”
“Sure, Honey,” she answered and sashayed away, stopping once to look over her shoulder at Allen. But his thoughts were elsewhere.
“Have you always known you were…a visionary?” Mel asked as she stirred her coffee.
Allen glanced around to see if anyone was within earshot. He whispered, “What exactly are you asking?”
“My brother made this top for me. Not really my style, but he made it with love.” She gently touched the gauzy fabric around her neck. “Ben knew he was gay from the time he was a little boy,” Mel said softly. Her eyes welled up. “My mother simply ignored that fact. My father had an altogether different take on Ben. The things he would punish him for, well, it would just break your heart. That bastard took off in 1965. Good riddance.”
“Where is Ben now?”
“Buried in the Oswegatchie Cemetery outside of Fine, NY. Fine, NY! Funny, huh?” she laughed to cover the sadness.
More customers had begun to fill the place. The waitress returned once more. “What will it be?” she asked.
“Mel?” he asked.
She kept her head down and asked, “May I have a burger?” A tear rolled down her nose and fell on the menu.
“I’ll have the same,” he said. The waitress jotted it down as she walked away.
He gave Mel his napkin. “Dry your eyes, Sweetness,” then moved to a chair next to her and put his arm around her shoulders. “There are souls that are just too beautiful for this world,” he whispered in her ear. She had thought the very same thing a thousand times.
Two gay teens cautiously approached the table. Mel looked up. “Your fans, Mr. S! If you’ll excuse me…” The young men nearly levitated over a chance to chat with Allen. He watched her walk through a narrow doorway and into the restroom.
Splashing a little water on her face, she looked at her reflection. Her hands gripped the sides of the sink. “Pull it together,” she whispered to herself. Once she’d collected herself with a few deep breaths, she headed back to the table. She stopped and watched Allen as he spoke to them. He listened carefully as they replied and talked about their dreams.
Allen was leaning forward, elbows on his knees and speaking softly. He was incredibly patient as he explained what it took to get where he was. His enormous smile was evidence that he seemed to enjoy this part of his celebrity.
She leaned against the door frame, legs crossed at the ankles, her arms crossed just below her chest.
The two teens stood close to each other. For a second, their pinkies hooked together. Allen grinned. Removing the scarf from his wrist, he tied it around the wrist of the young man on the left, then lifted the tie from his neck and put it on the other fan. He held out his hand to shake theirs.
An older couple seated at a nearby table shook their heads in disapproval. Mel stood and stared at them for a moment, then turned her back and obstructed their view. The boys practically pogoed over to her.
“Johnny, isn’t he amazing?” the shorter of the two asked his boyfriend.
He grinned at Mel and said, “He’s amazing!”
“He certainly is,” she replied. The boys left overwhelmed with joy about what had just happened.
The burgers arrived at the table as Mel sat back down. “Thank you,” she said to the waitress and tried to make eye contact.
Finally, she looked at Mel and said, “You’re welcome.”
“Those kids will be living on that for a long time. That’s just about the sweetest thing I have ever seen,” she told him.
“I could say that about what you did for the guy sitting in front of your building earlier, but I won’t. Mine was sweeter.”
Her laugh reached the customers near the front door. “Sorry,” she said, covering her mouth, trying to muffle the sound. “You are a brat!”
“The boys’ names are Jon and Johnny. Isn’t that sweet? They’re hoping to open a clothing store in the village.” As he set his coffee cup on the saucer, his hand trembled again, rattling both. “Don’t ever apologize for your laugh. I like people that let their emotions out. I’d hate to think what would happen if you tried to hold that inside. It could be catastrophic! Your eyes and brain would be scattered everywhere!” he nearly shrilled, while his hand swiped through the air as if he were carrying a tray of filled coffee cups.
She was about to ask him about his hand, but he stood, excused himself, and headed toward the restroom. His hand, his life. It was quite simply none of her business.
When he returned, they continued to talk for another hour or so. Allen had participated in the Stonewall riots and Mel wanted to learn about every scrap of it.
“I witnessed the woman, Storme DeLarverie, fighting the cops. Some aren’t sure it was her, but I’m convinced it was. When she yelled out to us, ‘Why don’t you guys do something?’ we all went crazy. I guess we all have a boiling point.”
“Truer words, my friend. Ben wanted so much to be a part of it. He never hid who he was. All he ever wanted was to work for, well, someone exactly like you. Damn, you would have loved him,” she said, leaning back in her chair.
“The mob and the cops were involved in the whole thing. Talk about an uphill battle. At that time, the lesbians, queens and gays were not exactly a team.”
“Really? You’d think people treating all of you like dirt would be enough to pull everyone together,” she said.
“Well, to be fair, I’ve seen the same sort of division in the women’s movement.”
“You’re right.” She paused and said, “Things are going to change. They’ve got to. We have no control over who we fall in love with.” She lit one of the two cigarettes she had left. “Would you like one?” she offered. He waved it off. “Do you have somebody special in your life?” she asked.
“Yes, I do. A man named Christopher.” Allen’s eyes lit up.
“How did you meet?”
“Everyone thinks we met at a fashion show. We met while waiting for a cab. Long story short, we ended up sharing one and kept on sharing.”
“How long are the two of you together?”
“Almost a year,” he answered with a smile.
“How did you know it was love?”
“Oh, good Lord. How does anyone ever truly know? I wish I could say that it was love at first sight. Like a bolt of lightning jabbing me in the heart and I would never be the same. I think that’s bull. It never happens that way. How about you? Is there someone special?”
“No,” she said, stood and tossed her bag over her shoulder. She sighed as she thought about the bill. “I don’t even have enough money for a decent tip. I promise I will pay you back.” As she passed the kaleidoscope painting, she stopped to take a closer look but gasped when she saw the price.
He stood and tossed a few bills on the table. As he passed the waitress, he shoved a few additional bills into her pocket. “Thank you, dear.” She smiled at him, then continued to pour coffee into another young man’s cup, flirting away with her latest customer.
It felt good to have something substantial in her stomach for a change. As they left the eatery and headed north, a sophisticated man walked toward them. His Dobermann ignored the noises around him. “Geeze. Check out this beautiful beast,” she gushed. “Excuse me. May I pet him?” she asked the gentleman.
“He can be skittish,” he replied.
Mel held her hand out palm down. She let the dog take its time sniffing, and then she turned her hand over. He began to lick her fingers.
“Well, I’ll be,” said the man.
“My trick is to let them smell me when I just finished eating,” she joked. The gentleman chuckled as he and his pet went on with their walk.
“You like dogs?” Allen asked.
“To be honest, I love them. Dogs are such wonderful creatures. They love you no matter what. That’s hard to find.”
“Let me get a cab.” There were none in sight. While they waited at the curb, a policeman began to cross the street and headed toward them. Allen shoved his hand into his pockets and quietly asked, “Would you take my arm?”
Mel did not realize what was happening but did what he had asked. It was then that she noticed the officer. Mel laid her head on his shoulder and focused her gaze on a couple window shopping across the street. Once he had passed, she removed her arm from his. “I hate that fucking shit,” she hissed. Allen looked down at her face. Her eyes were blazing. He waved down an approaching cab, and they piled in.
“You can’t let it get to you,” he said in a matter-of fact kind of way. He turned his attention to the cabbie and said, “West Central Park and 69th.” This time, she accepted when he offered a cigarette.
Pulling her hair back, she leaned into the lighter’s flame. She sighed. “I’m not able to pay for anything, and it’s driving me nuts. I’m embarrassed,” and sighed again. “As soon as I…”
“Later, OK?” he asked and patted her hand.
She could not help but look up at all the high-reaching buildings that stood in Manhattan. “I can never get over just how immense this place is.” Her head was just about upside down, trying to get the best possible view.
“Yes. You are adorable.” She didn’t hear him. The city and all its energy had her full attention. Allen turned to the gorgeous driver. When they arrived at his address, the cabbie thanked Allen for the tip. He also handed him a slip of paper with his name and number on it.
Allen just smiled and put it in his pocket.
A uniformed doorman held open the heavy glass door. “Good afternoon, Mr. Shandi.”
“Hey there, George. How are Christina and the baby?”
“They are wonderful, thanks for asking.”
“Come on. You must have a picture, yes?”
With that, George pulled his wallet out of his pocket and opened it to a photo.
“Oh,” Allen said with a sigh. “Oh my gosh. They are lovely. Is Penelope about four months old now? Look at these beautiful women, Mel.”
She took the wallet. The woman in the photo looked thrilled to be a mom. Little Penelope’s toothless grin was precious. “You are a very lucky man,” she said placing her hand on her abdomen. Still smiling, she handed it back to him.
“Yes, I am.” George took a few seconds to look at the picture before putting it away.
“By the way, Christopher has taken Daphne for a walk.”
Allen gave him a wink. “Thanks, George.”
The elevator required a unique key to go to the penthouse. Mel and Allen rode it nine floors up. When the elevator doors opened, they stepped into a small area with a large door across the way. He opened it and they entered an extravagant vestibule. Mel had never seen or could even imagine such wealth. An older gentleman greeted Allen with his mail and messages.
He looked inquisitively at Melanie.
Allen said, “This is my sweet friend, Melanie. Mel, this is Quinten. If you need or want anything, this is your man.”
Mel extended her hand out to Quinten and said, “Nice to meet you.” He hesitated and looked at Allen. Allen grinned.
He took her hand and said, “It’s very nice to meet you. Would you prefer Mel or Melanie?”
“Either is fine. May I use the bathroom?”
“Of course, follow me, please.”
The bathroom was straight ahead and to the right. It was below a winding staircase with full bookshelves. Quinten lightly pressed the spine of a red and black book, and a door opened outward. Orange-yellow light spilled out onto the tiled floor.
“I’ve never actually seen a secret door. Very cool! Thank you,” she said and went inside. The dominant color was red, and the accent colors were black, gold and purple. Tiles of red with gold swirls outlined in black covered the bottom half of the walls. The upper half was crimson. She was sure the entire room was larger than her apartment. There were several black and red velvet ottomans and a purple and gold chaise lounge in a sitting area. On the other side of a half wall was the toilet and a bidet alongside it. Over the double sinks hung an enormous mirror with an ornate frame. She set her bag on the black marble counter between the sinks. As she sat on the toilet, she tried to take all of it in. “And this is just the bathroom,” she whispered. Once she’d finished, she washed her hands and raked her fingers through her hair.
Allen was waiting for her. “I’d like to show you something.” They went up the stairs and off to the left. After passing several rooms, Allen held open the door to a bedroom. She flashed him a confused expression.
“Oh! No. This isn’t one of those ‘I’d like to show you my etchings’ snares. I wanted to show you a few things from my collection. It’s through the doorway on the left.”
She did not budge. “Wait here,” he said and disappeared into that room. As he came back, he draped pieces of clothing on hangers across the bed. Spreading them out, he chose a backless sequin-covered halter top jumpsuit in champagne gold. “Isn’t this scrumptious?”
“It’s dazzling. But it’s not my style.”
He looked at the remainder of what was on the bed. “That’s the second time you’ve mentioned your style. What is your style, exactly?”
“I like a less feminine look, you know? I’ve always been a tomboy,” she said timidly. “Do you design things for men?”
The sound of quickly clicking toenails on the wood floor grew louder. With that, a magnificent Rottweiler burst into the room. “Daphne-love!” gushed Allen.
Catching his breath, Christopher followed. He stood over six feet tall, blonde hair parted on the right and trimmed with precision. Although he was slender, he was muscular the way 20-year-old men often are. “I’m back from our daily tug. She is going to pull my arm out one of these days,” he said.
Daphne’s interest shifted to the new scent in the room. Her full tail swished back and forth as she sniffed Mel’s feet and legs.
“Who is this?” Christopher asked, inspecting Mel.
She stuck out her hand, “I’m Mel Foster.” He hesitated for a moment, then took her hand. “It’s very nice to meet you,” she said. Still looking at Christopher, she asked, “Daphne’s tail is intact? I don’t think I’ve ever seen that. She’s a beauty.”
“We got her when she was a pup, and we specifically told them not to do that. It’s unthinkable,” Allen huffed.
Mel was on her knees, along with Christopher, cuddling and scratching her belly. “We had a large dog when I was little. Just a mutt, but at least 100 pounds. My father found a harness for her and it helped when we had to walk her.” Daphne jumped onto Mel knocking her back with her legs folded under her and began licking her face. Mel laughed and hugged her around the neck.
“Daphne!” Allen laughed. “Come! Come here, my girl.” She obediently went to his side.
“May I have a washcloth or something?” Mel asked once Allen had lured Daphne away.
Christopher answered, “Sure.” Mel followed him out of the bedroom and down the hall.
“Second door on the left,” he said with a forced smile.
She pushed the door, but it did not close all the way. Splashing her face with warm soap and water removed the drool from her face. Two black velvet ottomans placed side by side with a tiny table between were in the corner. She sat and took advantage of the small, crystal ashtray. Digging through her bag, she retrieved her last cigarette, matches and a hair clip. Taking a deep drag, she grabbed everything and went to the mirror. With the cigarette hanging from her mouth, she pulled her thick hair and piled it on the crown of her head. The extra-large leather slide barely fit over her mop of curls. She pushed the stick through the holes to secure everything in place. Invariably, five or six tendrils hung down around her neck, dripping down over her back and shoulders. She could hear a discussion growing louder coming from the bedroom. “She will end up becoming just another fag-hag for you. What is this, the fifth? I do not need yet another person hanging around watching us as if you and I were a freakshow,” Christopher said firmly.
“You are wrong about her. She’s one of us. Her ideas about women’s clothing are perfect for what’s down the road,” said Allen.
“Is that how you met her?” There was a pause.
Trying to make her presence known, Mel tugged the door open and stomped heavily onto the floor. Daphne flounced toward her. “I’m going to have to get going, little girl.” Holding either side of her enormous head, she kissed her loudly.
“Your hair. I love it!” declared Allen. “I have a proposal for you, Mel. You brought up a more masculine feel for women’s clothing. Would you help me bring that idea to life?” Allen asked.
“I don’t know the first thing about fashion.”
Christopher laughed, “You’ve got that right.”
“Now, now. Let’s not be bitchy,” said Allen.
Mel motioned toward Christopher while looking at Allen and said, “He understands that I do not…”
“Sometimes, all you need to know is what you like and what you don’t like,” said Allen. “Like art.” He grabbed her hand and led her to the back of the bedroom. After opening the double-door walk-in closet, he began to look through his clothes. He chose a white button-down shirt from his closet. “What would you do with this?” He held it out to her. His right arm was across his chest and was clutching his left bicep. His forearm extended outward with the palm of his hand facing the ceiling, and the shirt dangled from his fingertip. She would come to know this as his “What say you?” pose.
“Seriously?” She exhaled. Taking the shirt from him, she hung it from an indentation on one of the columns of the four-poster bed. Christopher gasped at the thought of damage done to the tiger maple column. “I would make it sleeveless and shorten the front to waist length.” She turned it around. Christopher stepped in and held it for her. “Thanks, Christopher. It could be darted a bit to fit my form, then lengthened the shirttail to fall just passed the…” she patted her rear.
“Ass?” Christopher asked. Allen gave him a look.
“Well, I was gonna say cheeks, but either fit. Split it up the middle to about two inches below the waistline. It would end up kind of like tails on a tux. If you could give it lapels rather than a collar, I think that would be something I’d like.”
“What would you wear with it?” asked Allen.
Taking a moment to think, she finally said, “I would wear straight leg jeans and man boots up to my knees. You know, the kind that you tie up in the front without the spiky heels.”
Allen looked over at Christopher and said, “Do you see what I mean?”
“Do you design clothes also, Christopher?”
He seemed insulted by the question. “I am a model,” he answered in a sharp tone.
“I’m sorry. I don’t read many magazines.” Pointing out her appearance with gesturing hands, she laughed, “Just look at me for crying out loud!”
“I have to give you that,” Christopher said.
“Honey, that’s not…” Allen started to say.
“But it’s funny and appropriate,” answered Mel. “Allen, thanks for all of this. I’ve got to get going.”
A nearly palpable look went from Allen to Christopher. Christopher shrugged his shoulders and said, “OK,” and he left the room.
“This might be forward, but I…we wondered if you would consider staying with us while we take Cleo in this new direction? This place has several empty rooms. But I think you’d truly love the one on the far end.”
“But I haven’t agreed to the clothing thing.”
He ignored her. She followed him to an enormous room down the hallway. Daphne’s toenails let them know she was right behind them. Everything was covered with sheets except the king-size bed. Sliding glass doors on the far side of the room led to a balcony complete with greenery and furniture. The walls were white, and the furniture was in varying shades of red. As the sun fell low in the sky, it cast a fantastic orangey-pink over everything around her, including Allen.
“Isn’t it gorgeous?”
“Yes, but I have a job,” she said.
He came toward her and held her by the shoulders. “This is an opportunity to grow. It will be your job. Name your price.” She was only aware of his hands on her. Everything else was a blur. “Please?” he asked, batting his eyes again. Allen bent down a bit to meet her eye and was inches from her face. “I need you.”
She paused, then finally said, “Yes. Thank you. Allen, I am so grateful…” but the lump in her throat and tears squelched her ability to speak.
Allen threw his arms around her and she pulled away just a bit. He laughed and said, “I’m sorry. I excite easily!”
“Good to know,” she said, patting him on the back. He laughed into her ear. The sensation of his breath on her neck was incredible and alarming at once. “I have one request.”
“Name it.”
She pulled back and placed her hands on his chest. “I am not a huggee, cuddly, touchy-feely person. Please, don’t take it the wrong way. You are such a great guy, a real gentleman. You would never deliberately hurt anyone. It just makes me uncomfortable.”
He looked into her eyes. “Of course, I can respect that.” He backed away. “I understand, you know. Maybe better than most. I was different, too.” She felt light-headed.
“Are you alright?” he asked.
“Yes. I think I need a shower and a good night’s sleep.”
“Can I have Quinten bring you a bite to eat?”
“No, not right now. If I get hungry, I’ll poke around the kitchen, if that’s OK.”
“It’s fine with me, but Quinten gets a bit touchy when his domain is disturbed.”
“I promise I’ll clean up after myself,” she offered.
“Good Lord, woman, I was joking! Feel free to have anything you’d like.” He left her room and closed the door behind him.
Chapter 3
By the next morning, all of Mel’s belongings had been picked up and delivered to the penthouse. That afternoon, Allen purchased a month’s worth of clothing for her right down to her panties, along with a carton of her favorite cigarettes plus several joints. She sat on the edge of the bed surrounded by all of it, including the jelly jar she’d given to Fred and her prized possession. It was an old lockbox. Taking the key out of her bag, she placed the box on her lap and opened it slowly. Lifting the three photographs of her brother, Benjamin, from inside, she traced his face with her finger. It also contained a spool of fishing line. She looked up to see Allen standing in the doorway. She closed the box and set it aside.
“Would you like a hand putting things away?” he asked.
“I can’t accept all of this.”
“Consider it an advance,” he said. “Anything you dislike will be returned, exchanged, whatever.” He walked toward her.
Mel stood and moved toward the middle of the room. “You could have let my friend keep the glass,” she remarked.
“I did something a little better, I think. I hope you agree. Fred now occupies your old apartment, and I’ve paid up for two years. He has several new outfits, a bit of cash, and will be filling in at your old job until you decide what you want to do. I will find another place for you to live if you think this isn’t working out, but I want you to share your ideas with me,” he said in a serious tone.
She turned away from him. “I’m going to do my very best for you. Thank you for giving me this chance.”
He moved toward her, then thought better of it. Quinten knocked on the door frame.
“Excuse me, Sir. How many for dinner tonight?”
“Six, I think. Very casual, OK?” Allen asked.
“Time?”
“Six-thirty.”
“Is there anything, in particular, you would like tonight, Sir?”
“Mel, if you sat down in a restaurant and could have anything you wanted, what would it be?” Allen asked her.
She chuckled. “I feel as if I’m in a dream, or I’m high. Maybe I’ve died and gone to Heaven.” She asked timidly, “Do you like spaghetti and meatballs and maybe a salad?”
“Perfect. Is that doable, Quinten?”
“Of course, Sir. Can I get you anything in the meantime, Miss Melanie?”
“No thanks, and for God’s sake, drop the Miss. You make me feel as if I’m the character in ‘Gone with the Wind’! Or worse, my mother.”
“Quinten, could you give us a minute?”
“Of course,” he said and went downstairs.
Allen sat on the bench at the foot of the bed. His legs crossed at the knee and leaning back on his hands. “Did I tell you how I ended up living here?” he asked Mel. She shook her head, no. He gestured with his hand for her to sit next to him. She sat beside him with her legs apart, her elbows resting on her thighs and hands folded. He brushed her hair over her shoulder.
“I just want to see your face, OK?”
“Yes,” she answered and looked at him.
“My father owned an oil conglomerate. It doesn’t matter which one. They are all greed-factories. He could buy and sell God, or so he said. The best part is that God got the last laugh. One morning he told his secretary that there were to be no phone calls, no interruptions. He had a massive heart attack at his desk while she typed away just outside his door. Side note, she was also his mistress. An hour and a half later, she poked her head in to ask a question. She found him sweat-soaked and face down in a pool of his vomit. The Man upstairs is a funny guy, don’t you agree?”
“I gather you were not close to him?”
“No one was. My father loved money and fucking women. If he could have figured out a way to bang them with a roll of hundreds on his cock, it would have been his ejaculation of a lifetime.”
“Wow,” she chuckled. “How did your mom take it?”
“Poor thing, she loved him and not for his money. She would tell me about the 19-year-old boy she’d met all those years ago. Generous, kind, hardworking and very gentle with her. Somewhere along the line, he soured. He began drinking to excess and worse, hitting her. He became ruthless.”
“Did he know you are gay?”
“I think if he’d spent just a bit of time with me, he would have. But you must be in the same room with a person, look into their eyes, listen to what they say to learn anything. My wonderful mother died two years after my father. Countless homes, cars, all kinds of ‘things’ had become the property of my brother and me. Did I tell you I have a brother? Keith. Funny guy. A good man. Anyway. He and I sold most of it and gave the money to charities for the homeless, hospitals, but the best was handing out money to anyone that looked like they could use it. We knew this would make the old bastard roll in his grave. Even better, we made the donations in his name.”
“Ooooh, you scoundrels. I love it,” she laughed.
“Quinten has been with our family since before I was born. He is an old-fashioned gentleman’s gentleman. He just can’t help himself. I know for certain there were times that he would intercept when that bastard was after my mom. He’d lie and say there was a phone call or news on TV about my father’s company. My father was so drunk he probably could have distracted him with a ring of keys, …like an infant. All that being said, Quinten is who he is, and we accept him that way. Alright?”
Her face was beet red. “Yes. Understood. I’ll make it right.” She looked back on the bed and asked, “I hate to sound like such a girl, but what are you wearing tonight?”
Allen laughed. “How do jeans and a shirt sound? Shoes are optional.”
“Comfortable, thank you.”
Allen’s chef, Wyatt Edmonds, had taken the time to ask Mel about her selection for dinner, right down to the amount of garlic or basil. He stood at six foot four and two hundred forty pounds of muscle. He looked extremely intimidating, but that turned out to be completely wrong. He was a gentle and soft-spoken man. It was moving to see his interest in what would make her happy.
That evening, softly playing jazz hung in the background. Allen and Christopher were in one of two black loveseats in a cozy area of the living room. The other loveseat was directly across from them, with two red high-back chairs between them facing the fireplace. A black lacquered coffee table sat between it all.
The first to arrive were two women that worked in the garment district. Eric had red cropped hair and was wearing a man’s blue button-down shirt tucked into her black jeans with a matching blue belt and sneakers.
Mel asked Eric, “May I ask, do you consider yourself a ‘he’ or ‘she’?”
“He, and thank you for asking.” His girlfriend, Meghan also had red hair, but shoulder length. She wore a short denim skirt, a red sweater and black high heels. After the introductions, Allen offered drinks. Eric would have his usual Pabst Blue Ribbon beer in a pint glass while Meghan preferred white wine. Rather than help, Christopher called out for a vodka and tonic. As Allen gave Eric and Meghan their drinks, he heard the elevator door open and excused himself. Mel went to the bar to make Christopher’s drink. She brought it to him and asked, “What do you think Allen will have?”
“I have no idea,” he answered, not meeting her eyes.
“Mel, meet Zora Preston. She is a buyer for one of the high-end stores on 5th Avenue. Zora, Mel Foster.”
She was a tall, curvy African American woman with a beautiful, giant Afro. She wore a tight-fitting, sleeveless black turtleneck sweater, large gold hoop earrings and a floor-length striped skirt in all the colors of the rainbow. Mel smiled and shook her hand. “Do you prefer Mel or Melanie?” Zora asked in a soft and sexy voice.
“Either is fine.”
“Then, Melanie, it is.”
“Your hair is gorgeous!” Mel gushed.
“As is yours,” she responded, taking a handful and twirling it between her fingers.
“I told her just how beautiful you are, Mel. And did I lie?” Allen asked, holding his hands to her like the statuesque women on game shows would when displaying a new car.
Mel became an entirely new shade of red. “Allen, please.” She laughed and turned to Zora. “If you know Allen at all, then you know how generous he is with his compliments. Zora, what can I get you to drink?”
“I’ll have whatever you’re having,” she smiled, putting her hand on top of Mel’s. The sound of ice cubes clinking together came from Christopher. He’d raised his glass and shook it. Allen snatched it from his hand, then he and Mel went to the bar.
“What’s going on, Allen?”
“I’m sorry for Christopher’s behavior.”
“That’s not what I meant. Why is Zora here?”
“I thought the two of you might hit it off,” he said innocently.
“Oh, good Christ,” she said, leaning on the marble surface. She closed her eyes and said, “Are you under the impression that I am a lesbian?”
“Well, yes.”
“Oh, my God,” she whispered, then laughed. “I can’t be upset with you. A tomboy is a stone’s throw from that. No, I’m not a lesbian. This beautiful woman was brought here as my date?”
“I am so sorry,” he said, thoroughly embarrassed. “Let me talk to Zora.”
“No. That’s OK. Let me,” Mel said. After handing Christopher his drink, she asked, “Zora, would you mind checking out the wine selections?”
“Not at all.”
Allen watched out of the corner of his eye as Mel placed her hand on Zora’s back. Mel smiled at her and spoke softly. A look of confusion came across Zora’s face as Mel spoke but quickly changed to a warm smile. Zora placed her hand on Mel’s. She kissed her on the forehead and, with her thumb, wiped the lipstick it left behind. Their attention turned to the wine. Mel laughed loudly at something Zora said. Christopher smirked at Mel. “Idiot,” he said under his breath. Allen shot him a look.
The evening continued as if nothing had happened. The dining room table was set, complete with two flower arrangements. Allen and Christopher sat at opposite ends of the table. Eric and Meghan sat on one side and Mel and Zora on the other.
Mel asked Eric, “How long have you two been together?”
Eric lifted Meghan’s hand from under the table and kissed it. “Two years. The first time I saw Meghan, I was hooked. I couldn’t take my eyes off her. Then she turned and looked at me and smiled. I couldn’t believe it. Everything came into focus. People say things like the sky is bluer, the birds sing more sweetly, and that is the truth. She was just what I needed in my life,” Eric said and leaned in for a kiss.

Love All the Way
3 ratings","Love All the Way by Aurora Carafa is a captivating novel that explores the lives of the LGBTQ community during a time of scarce acceptance. The book exposes the harsh realities faced by individuals, while showcasing the beauty of friendships and relationships that develop amidst the challenges. What I appreciated was how the author tackled ALS with sensitivity and clarity, providing a nuanced understanding of its impact. Moreover, the friendships and relationships in the book were remarkable, particularly the bond between Melanie and Allen, built on mutual support and trust. Furthermore, the thoughtful pacing allowed the reader to absorb the emotional depth of the characters' experiences. The level of support and love shared among the characters was moving, and the author's ability to balance humor, emotion, and information was impressive. However, I didn't appreciate Melanie's love for Allen, which felt imposing on his relationship with his husband. Despite this, the book's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and I rate it 5 out of 5. I recommend Love All the Way to mature audiences due to its graphic content and to the LGBTQ community, as it serves as a powerful reminder that there are individuals who will fight for and with you. The book's emotional ending, coupled with its informative and engaging narrative, makes it a must-read. With minor grammatical errors, the book was well-put-together, and I highly recommend it. Overall, the book is a heartwarming and thought-provoking read that will leave a lasting impression. The author's dedication to storytelling shines through, making this book a memorable experience.

This book is dedicated to my three daughters:
Kimberly Beth, Wendy Lynn, and Jodi Allison.
With each day of research, and with every page of agonized text in the preparation of this book, I realized more and more how love can overcome even the most primitive impulse of a parent to harm their offspring.
I hope that the findings contained herein will extend this realization to parents, and future parents, all over the world.

INTRODUCTION
""Infanticide has been practiced on every continent and by people on every level of cultural complexity, from hunters and gatherers to high civilizations, including our own ancestors. Rather than being an exception, then, it has been the rule.""1
In 1978, Laila Williamson, an anthropologist with the American Museum of Natural History, summarized the data she had collected on the presence of infanticide from a variety of sources in the scientific, and historical, literature by bluntly concluding that murdering one's own child was a common human trait. Although verification of each event was not always possible within each civilization studied, the information she gathered clearly showed that the problem was of protean proportion and not simply dismissible as an accidental aberration. Much of the evidence she cited came from the work of Divale and Harris who performed demographic analysis of 561 local band and village populations from 112 different societies. They found that in an ethnographic census of 393 populations, 179 practiced infanticide commonly, 29 occasionally, and 94 on an isolated basis.2 Only 91, or 23%, did not show any evidence of an accepted custom of infanticide.
Many observers of human behavior have brushed this incontrovertible evidence aside, and continued to view the killing of children by parents as a desultory footnote in the history of mankind.3 After all, how likely is it, the argument goes, that a review of mostly tribal populations can be expanded to a generalization on the entire human race? These are ""savages"" from the wild; they have little in common with the rest of our modern civilization.
To some degree, this brusque dismissal appears to have a modicum of legitimate critique. If the problem of infanticide is truly this widespread -- if the history of mankind has indeed been peppered with the constant killing of children by their biologic parents -- why has there been so little overt reaction among either governmental, religious, or academic sources? Surely the presence of this much killing, if indeed it had occurred, should provoke a response at least equal to that which has transpired with respect to the morality, or legality, of abortion. Nothing short of mayhem has developed over the argument of when life begins, and whether the fetus has an independent right to life. Should there not have been as equally intense outrage over murdering a child once it was born, if indeed the crime is that common?
The logical response to this query is obvious - yes. But whatever the reasons for the lack of societal outrage, the historical evidence of infanticide clearly supports Williamson's conclusion. In the words of Lloyd DeMause:
All families once practiced infanticide. All states trace their origin to child sacrifice. All religions began with the mutilation and murder of children.4
Where then do we find a rationale for this social commentary vacuum? One possible explanation could be that the claimed frequency of such a detestable parental act is simply not believed. Most people find it difficult to accept that anyone, except the most severely mentally disturbed felon, would kill their own child. In fact, the report of such a crime in the newspaper generally appears on the front page, with pictures of the accused parent boldly displayed, so unusual and shocking are the details to the average reader.
And even when stories are proven true, just how much depravity can the public absorb? There are many problems in the world today: hunger, pollution, war and crime. Newborns die everywhere from a variety of nutritional or medical problems; we are inundated with the statistics of famine, of genocide, of man’s utter disregard for the sanctity of life. Just how important can the loss of a single infant be to the community-at-large?
People can accept just so much negative news before the source is turned off; the newborn is a good place to start. This is known not only to newspaper reporters, but also to scientists seeking research grants or academic support. Investigation into the widespread killing of children by their parents is not high on the public relations list of most universities. Robert Weir wrote that ""infanticide has been tolerated by the great majority if not all of the world's societies.""5 While harming a helpless child may induce instant sympathy, the incident is unfortunately soon forgotten. Newborns do not have an equal legal status to that of an older child or adult, and generally there are few individuals outside of the family circle to come to their aide.
The informational gap on this subject is incredibly wide. Scholarly works, as well as the lay press, show a rarity of comment that indicates how often historians miss the human factor in studying past civilizations. As for the research into general human behavior, infanticide has been almost totally ignored. When acts of child-murder are referenced at all, they generally are passed off as some quirk or defective apparatus of an unusual place or time. Look in the index of almost any major social treatise and you will find only a rare reference to the presence of infanticide.
But the fact of the matter is that infanticide is not an isolated phenomenon and cannot be explained by some aberrant, sociopathic excuse. From sacrificial killings meant to appease the wrath of gods, to the abandonment of bastard newborns in an attempt to hide from shame, human beings have slaughtered their offspring with no less frequency than they have murdered in the pursuit of war and oppression. The shear numbers are staggering. In every era, in every country, some degree of infanticide has been found. While certain societies have noted only sporadic cases, others reveal that 10-50% of all newborns have been killed either at birth, or soon thereafter. And for the most part, these killings have proceeded with either the direct participation, or the permission, of the child's parent and societal legal codes.
Of course, this does not negate the role of criminal activity. Infanticide has indeed been due to psychopathic behavior, or even temporary insanity, which makes the actions of the guilty party excusable under most legal systems. But the killings are so pervasive among disparate groups of man that an explanation must be sought not in human behavioral pathology, but in the very genetic nature of our species itself. Along with billions of other traits, inherited from one generation to the next, has come a tendency to eliminate our own children when some type of self-survival impulse is ignited.
Such a negative connotation to the nature of man does not sit well with modern beliefs. We have come to think of ourselves in humanistic tones which frames us in the benevolent image of a man-made God: an ""Imago Dei"", capable of rational thought and moral action. In the first chapter of the Bible we read that ""God created man in his image.""6 Humankind has accepted this pronouncement as evidence that they are blessed in a manner unlike every other living creature. But our factual behavior, at least with respect to the prevalence of infanticide, does not seem to support such a self-serving hypothesis.
In this book, without judging whether our actions are good or evil, or whether they reflect the words of a higher Deity, I intend to show that the frequency of infanticide is so prodigious that it must be assessed as indicative of ""normal"" behavior. While it may not be the type of behavior we are used to seeing as ""humane,” it nevertheless must be reinterpreted in light of this undeniable common prevalence. Every society has had its criminals who have acted outside both the moral and legal code, but the majority of documented infanticides reveals that the parent has acted in an understandable, and often forgivable, way. Most readers would respond to this statement with disbelief because they do not see such criminal propensity within themselves, or their close circle of family and friends. However, it is also a fortunate fact that most citizens of the Western World have never been faced with the need to consider an infanticidal option for any of the reasons that are discussed later in this book. In the words of a very old proverb, it is very hard to walk in another man's shoes, and it is not a fair judgement to vow that you would be willing to exchange your own life for that of your child when the occasion is likely never to arise.
This brings us to the very core of why it is so difficult to analyze the basis for our actions in the complicated society we live in today. Before we can truly comprehend the reason why an individual responds to a particular stressful situation, we must first understand the instincts which guide our basic biologic drives. Much of our behavior is reflexual rather than learned; the genetic material guiding our response has survived, to some degree, within our own chromosomes from prehistoric ancestors. While this conduct, over time, can be modified to some extent, we are nevertheless a product of our nature and are limited by self-serving, self-preserving genes.
Such pagan shortcomings do not sit well with many modern humanists who would like to believe that man is capable of always acting in a moral, ethical, ""humane"" way. They find no limitation to the benevolent potential of the human species; evil is a preventable commodity as long as society makes the right choices. But such an ideal assessment is only possible when seen through modern methods of environmental control.
The twentieth century has completely isolated us from our true biological beginnings. Our way of life demonstrates how totally our dominion over the earth is now almost complete. In only 7000 years, a mere blink of the eye in the evolution of our species, we have gone from domestication of plant and animal life to a state where we not only farm the commodities we desire, we are now able to modify that life to our liking with gene-splicing technology. Mountain ranges, which once stood as proud and inviolate structures leading to the legendary feats of Hannibal, are now pocked with tunnels, electric lines and ski lifts to satisfy the recreational desires of the masses. The deepest ocean floor, imagined with intensity by Jules Verne, is crisscrossed with telephone cables; the heavens, which have mesmerized man from the very moment his eyes could look up at the sky, now abound with satellites and man-made debris.
Our ability to rapidly change an environment that took millions of years to form is frightening. We seem to be intent on a rapid pace of progress driven by an insatiable quest for knowledge and reward. It is not only greed which fuels this drive, it is the belief that scientific advancement is synonymous with ""good for mankind."" And in this venue we ravage the forests, pollute the seas, and fill the air with toxic wastes that affect every living species on earth.
This general indifference to the physical environment of our planet has carried over to our interpersonal relationships with our fellow human beings as well. It has been relatively easy for historians to portray the human species as a violent race, capable of ruthless behavior from an anthropologic perspective. Our intense desire for domination over neighboring populations has characterized every society of mankind. While one can usually find improvement in thought and design throughout every gathering studied, there is usually an affiliated spillage of blood as well.
The history of the Golden Age of Greece is not confined to Socratic discussions and the rise of a democratic spirit, it is deluged with the bloody wars so descriptively portrayed in the heroic tales of Homer and the chronicles of Herodotus. The Romans were famous for their architectural advances, and for legal systems which form the ethical basis of our modern age, but their conquests of other nations entailed so much mutilation and devastation that the Roman populace would eventually take pleasure in watching human slaughter continue in their amphitheaters as entertainment and sport. The Egyptians, Sumerians and Assyrians may have left us a legacy of language and astronomic expanse, but the bloody battles they waged throughout the cradle of civilization is punctuated with chilling tales of torture and death. In the words of Anthony Storr: ""The somber fact is that we are the cruellest and most ruthless species that has ever walked the earth.""7
Much of this callous destruction of life has been excused as killing with a necessary, social purpose in sight: Crusades designed to follow the commands of God; border skirmishes and world wars to free those enslaved by a tyrannical regime; covert actions of a democratic society to protect the rest of the free world from mayhem caused by rebellious fanatics. Ibn Khaldun, the fourteenth century Arab scholar, believed that these wars were:
Something natural among human beings. No nation and no race is free from it.8
But even if one accepts such a pessimistic and unitarian attitude toward killings condoned by the fervor of nationalistic spirit, is it possible to use a similar explanation for the frequently encountered killing of a child by its own parent? Where can national safety and concern be hidden within such a seemingly brutal act? It might not surprise some skeptics that people view those of another color or race with caution and fear; hatred has always driven part of our social behavior. But what could possibly cause one to turn against his own offspring? Surely the inherent love of a parent for their child would be expected to countermand such a horrific impulse. And most evolutionary models of social motives do predict that genetic relationships will be associated with a mitigation of violent conflicts.9
If not only from a moral or religious base, then from a scientific, evolutionary approach, the survival of our species would seem to demand that such a protective trait be securely in place. How could our race replicate itself unless such desires force the parent to rear the majority of its young? Insects, who rely on thousands of eggs being dispersed at one time, can survive on the statistical reliance that some offspring will live; but with the ability to average only one birth a year, Homo sapiens cannot depend on numbers for equal assurance.
And so there must be some natural impulse which has evolved over the eons of time that encourages man to protect his young. One can see evidence of this throughout the animal kingdom. As the miracle of birth expels the helpless, totally dependent fetus into the world, almost every species shows some innate impulse to begin the nurturing process without being shown what methodology to use. Parents immediately tend to the neonate in an effective manner that is genetically determined. The mother or father almost never abandons the brood for self-centered reasons, but remains nearby to protect the young from predators and to provide nutrition until the infants are capable of surviving on their own. This instinct - ""acquired through the process of natural selection because it has a tendency to preserve the next generation and thereby the species,"" - is everywhere to be found.10 If such a trait was not inherent, there would be little chance that the fragile young newborns could survive the rigors of early life.
So it is with human beings as well. Our desire to procreate appears to be uniformly present and is culturally displaced in only rare exceptions, as among the ancient Roman nobility and certain American Indian cultures.11 Aristotle noted that men, like other plants and animals, ""have a natural desire to leave behind them an image of themselves.""12 In most societies, childless marriages and barren women were objects of pity or scorn.13 Under the Code of Jewish Law, for example, an Orthodox Jewish husband had to divorce a woman who was unable to bear a child after ten years of marriage.14 And the most serious violation of Confucian ideology is to not have children under the principle of filial piety.15
The Greeks and Romans even imbued their gods with such yearnings for fertility. Pluto, the lord of the underworld, complained bitterly to his brother Jove about his childless and unwed state, and even threatened war if he was not allotted a son. He spoke of his loneliness in an impassioned plea:
And shall I in this empty palace, sans joy, sans fame, know no child’s love to still instant care? I will not brook so dull a life.16
The first monotheistic God, as referenced in the Old Testament, made it a positive command to have children. Noah was told: ""Be fertile, then, and increase, abound on earth and subdue it.""17 According to the Talmud, life was incomplete if this directive was not followed:
A man without children is as if he were dead.18
A man without children is like a piece of wood, which
though kindled does not burn or give out light.19
In the early Irish poem, ""Childless"", the reasoning for despair was clear:
There is no hell, no lasting torment,
But to be childless at the end,
A naked stone in grassy places,
A man that leaves no love behind.20
Along with this protean desire to have children came an innate impulse to nurture them as well. Xenophon, the fifth century B.C. Athenian historian, explained that men had an inborn desire to beget children, and that mothers would naturally be desirous of rearing their babies.21 Plutarch, in the first century A.D., noted that despite the pain of childbirth, ""nature leads the mother to not neglect or avoid her child.""22 Epictetus, a contemporary of Plutarch, agreed that ""once a child is born it is no longer in our power not to love it or to care for it.""23
Western religious teachings were similarly supportive. Isaiah, the Old Testament prophet, assured the people of Israel that the Lord would not forsake them because, as any parent, He could not turn His back on them: ""Does a woman forget her nursling, and have no compassion on the child of her womb?""24 Children, the Psalms proclaimed, were a gift from God: ""They are His reward.""25 St. Augustine, the most respected of the Church Fathers, in the fourth century A.D. wrote how mothers nursed their children under the direction of God: ""For they, by an instinctive affection, were anxious to give me what Thou gavest them.""26
It is this necessary function of child-rearing that likely formed the very basis for how most human beings have chosen to live - within a family unit. Surveys of almost every known human society have shown the nuclear family as the critical recognizable unit.27 Rousseau called the family ""the oldest of all societies, and the only natural one.""28
In the most primitive tribes that have been studied in modern times, social groupings primarily revolved around this biological family unit.29 The male was generally the dominant head, although some societies developed matrilineal structures. In this latter arrangement, the maternal uncle actually had more authority over the children than the father.30 Female dominance was quite rare, however, and polygyny, or the marriage of one man with more than one wife, was one hundred forty-one times more common than polyandry, where a woman had more than one husband.31
For the most part, marriage, or the union of a male and female, was the basic model for family procreation. The function of the father was generally to support and protect the wife and children; the wives would perform household duties and were responsible for raising the children.32 Those males that did not marry were generally looked on as unnatural or were ridiculed.33 So important was procreation that in many tribes the marriage did not actually take full effect until a child was born.34 In ancient Egypt, for example, there was an initial one year ""trial marriage"" in order to determine first if the wife could become pregnant.35 After that, the marriage could become a permanent bond.
As civilization advanced, the status of the family remained the most prominent social source of strength. Aristotle, who based his philosophy on logic and reason, called the family an ""association established by nature for the supply of men's everyday wants.""36 And one of these supplies remained a steady source of heirs for both the satisfaction of the parent, and of the state as well. In numbers came strength, and defense against outside predators required a constant supply of healthy warrior men. In ancient Sparta, to encourage the having of children, fathers of three children were excused from military service, and the father of four did not have to pay taxes.37
This time-tested desire for children has become so ingrained in our present assessment of normal human behavior that negative or depressive reactions to the thought of parenthood has been considered by some psychiatrists as an abnormal state caused by problems in the person's own upbringing.38 It is obvious, then, that if our society may see the parent who questions even the desire to have children as defective or strange, it will usually automatically label one with the thought of committing infanticide as schizophrenic or psychopathic.39 Dr. Marcia Angell, in a 1983 editorial against the rigid restrictions on allowing handicapped newborns to die, reasoned that ""probably most parents would give their lives for their children; the circumstances in which parents would prefer death to survival for their child must be extraordinary indeed.""40 Rather than considering the possibility that the parent was under a transient abnormality, as might be expected in other types of capital crimes, or that the homicide could possibly have a defense of justification, the perpetrator of infanticide has often been segregated as a special type of personality disorder.41 In medieval England, when the secular courts began to prosecute for the crime of infanticide, the defense of insanity was almost always raised, and was almost always successful as well.42 A jury of one's peers could not imagine a ""sane"" person capable of such depravity.
It is easy to understand the reasoning behind this conclusion. Most parents genuinely believe that if they were ever faced with the frightening prospect that their child could be injured, they would risk their own life rather than let their children suffer harm. No matter how much they may love another unrelated human being, a child was a product of their own being - a genetic part of their very soul. No love could be as intense, or self-sacrificing, as that between a parent and a child.
But how prevalent is this natural bond which unites a parent to its biologic offspring? Herodotus, in his epic History, related how Darius, the Great Persian King, had arrested Intaphrenes and his entire family and charged them all with being enemies of the state. Such a crime usually led to immediate execution, but the beautiful wife of Intaphrenes begged Darius for mercy and the king relented, offering to spare her own life and that of one other family member. The woman chose her brother with the explanation that she could always marry a second time, and thereby have more children, but she would never again be able to have another brother.43 She allowed her children to die, but only so that another loved one, a brother even more dear, could survive. Was her decision pathologic or insane?
Evidence of other rational excuses for allowing one's child to die may be observed on sociological grounds. Thomas Malthus, in his First Essay on the Principle of Population in 1798 A.D., postulated that there were two laws fixed by nature: food was a necessary ingredient to the existence of man, and passion between the sexes would constantly result in the accumulation of excess members of the race.44 This meant that the population would increase unchecked in a geometrical ratio, while the necessary subsistence to feed the inhabitants increased in only an arithmetical ratio.45 The result was a constant tendency of animate life to expand beyond the available nourishment supply. If the food reserve to a community was already strained to the limit, and a newborn infant was allowed to live, it meant that the death of some other family member from starvation was more likely to occur.46 Was it pathologic or insane to then bury the baby at birth and allow the mother to return to her life-saving labor?
But even without these questions of loyalty to others within the family or caste, there is another justification which is clearly present in all human beings, save the pious martyr: the instinctual drive for self-survival. As much as we might strive to develop a human moral code that will put the welfare of all individuals on an even footing, the human organism will usually put its own safety above all else when threatened with mortal danger, even above that of its own offspring. As Tolstoy emphasized:
Man lives only for his own happiness - for his own good. If he does not feel a desire for his own welfare he no longer feels himself to be alive.47
Part of this self-survival involves seeing a child as a potential adversary in competition for limited assets. While offspring are usually the means to ""genetic posterity,"" the conflict between them ""is an endemic feature of sexually reproducing organisms because the allocation of resources and efforts that would maximize a parent's genetic posterity seldom matches that which would maximize a particular offsprings.""48 In other words, while children provide the means by which a family is assured continuation of its genetic heritage, individual members may find alternate goals which are in conflict with the common good.
This brief excursion into some of the reasons which explain why a parent might kill a child does not validate the act of infanticide, but it does help to elucidate it without resorting to a psychiatric or psychopathic diagnosis. It is this concept of excusable homicide that I believe explicates the majority of instances of child-murder throughout the evolution of our modern civilization. In this book I will analyze the historical evidence for infanticide from the viewpoint of many perspectives: religious, legal, scientific and social. I am not going to include any extensive discussion of abortion since, although technically a form of infanticide according to those who believe life begins at conception, the ethical and emotional arguments over this topic cover too great an expanse. I am also not going to discuss the killing of children by other family relatives, such as siblings. The parent-child relationship is closer, and more unique, than any other intra-familial bond, and generally does not involve the emotion of jealousy which plays such a large role with siblings.
Finally, I am going to restrict my analysis to the factual killing of children and not diffused behavior. In 1972, a seminar for playwrights and psychologists was held to explore the present day problems of filicide and infanticide. Emanuel Schwartz outlined the literary evidence in which parents seem to maim and murder their children:
We see filicidal themes in various forms of behavior, from traditionally accepted practices like circumcision to acts of gross mutilation; from parental disinvolvement to outright abandonment; from mistreatment to battering; from military conscription to murder.49
In this book I will not deal with wishes; such an approach would take us too far afield.
It may seem to be a strange arena where you try and understand how an individual can take his or her own child and strangle it to death. Yet, the importance of understanding the reasons for infanticide is borne out by its mathematical proportions. Since man first appeared on earth about 600,000 years ago, it has been calculated that about 77 billion human babies have been born.50 If estimates of infanticide of 5-10% are true, then up to seven billion children have been killed by their parents, a figure which should suffice as one of incredible importance.51
Julian Huxley called evolution ""an enormous number of blind alleys, with a very occasional path of progress.""52 It remains to be determined whether we are a benefit to the world at large, or a blind alley; whether the killing of children is a madness of a sick mind, or the product of a race that puts survival of the fittest above protection of the few. In other words, can we agree with Tylor's dictum that ""infanticide arises from hardness of life rather than hardness of heart.""53
If we are to make the determination fairly we must remember the story as told by Max Black:
A philosopher once said to a fish, ""The purpose of life is to reason and become wise."" The fish answered, ""The purpose of life is to swim and catch flies."" The philosopher muttered, ""Poor fish."" Back came a whisper, ""Poor philosopher.""54

CHAPTER I.
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND - ANTIQUITY
""To the shame of civilization it must be avowed that not a State has yet advanced to that degree of progress under which child-murder may be said to be a very uncommon crime.""1
This 1861 British editorial in the widely read, and well-respected, medical journal Lancet was part of a growing contemporary debate in England over what should be done to try and reduce the shameful frequency of infanticide that was spreading throughout the country. While various experts from a variety of disciplines castigated the conditions which allowed such heinous crimes to exist, they also pointed out that the problem was not unique to the British Isles in the nineteenth century. Throughout the history of the civilized world, from the Golden Age of Greece to the splendor of the Persian Empire, the killing of children was a vice that had pervaded almost every society of mankind.
In the next few chapters, I am going to present this world-wide history of infanticide from a chronological standpoint. The chapters which follow will then deal with the motives which undermine the crime, irrespective of the perspective of time. Before proceeding, however, it is necessary to clarify a few descriptive terms. The killing of one human being by another has been subdivided into many categories, dependent upon the status of perpetrator and victim. While the title of this book uses the term ""infanticide"" to refer to the murder of a child by its parent, this usage is not entirely accurate. The term ""infanticide,"" in common application, denotes the killing of an infant soon after its birth.2 There has not, however, been universal agreement on restricting the use of the word to only a narrow age range of young victims. Social anthropologists have simply defined infanticide as the killing of a ""newborn child"" by their parents or with their consent.3 Ethnographers have found that referring to it as the ""deliberate killing of a child in its infancy, up to two years of age, covers the majority of cases.""4 In the nineteenth century it was common to refer to infanticide as the killing of an infant at any age from birth to childhood.5
With such imprecise terminology, it is not surprising that some countries have restricted the legal usage of the term to more definite circumstances. In Canada, for example, infanticide occurs when a ""female person"" causes the death of her newly born child ""if at the time of the act or omission she is not fully recovered from the effects of giving birth to the child and by reason thereof or of the effect of lactation consequent on the birth her mind is then disturbed.""6 In Britain, infanticide includes the killing of infants up to twelve months of age, again only by mothers.7 If a child is destroyed before it is capable of independent existence of its mother, the offence is then referred to as ""child destruction.""8 In Denmark, infanticide is a medico-legal term that designates the killing of a child by its mother while the killing of a newborn by the father is ""wilful murder.""9 The killing of a son or daughter of any age is also referred to as ""filicide.""10 ""Neonaticide"" has been recommended to refer to the killing of a newborn under twenty-four hours of age.11 ""Pedocide"" has been used at times to denote the killing of any child,12 or the killing of a child between the age of one and sixteen years.13 Adelson defined post-infancy ""pedicide"" as the killing of a child who has emerged from infancy but not yet attained the age of fifteen years.14 The word ""libericide"" is also rarely used to denote the killing of an older child.15 ""Progenicide"" has been suggested for any act that is carried out in accord with cultural norms and functions selectively to reduce the probability of survival of offspring of a person or group.16
For the purposes of this book, the term infanticide will be used to cover instances of child-murder without differentiation as to gender of the killer or age of the victim.
A. Prehistoric Times
According to Dr. John Lightfoot, a seventeenth century A.D. biblical scholar and vice chancellor of Cambridge University: ""Man was created by the Trinity on the 26th of October, 4004 B.C. at 9 o'clock in the morning.""17 This analysis, based upon biblical reports, would account for the presence of man on earth for almost six thousand years.
Needless to say, the accuracy of this particular estimate has been seriously questioned. Scientists now believe, according to fossil records, that the family of man has likely been around for over two to three million years, with the evolution into modern Homo sapiens occurring somewhere around 100,000 years ago.18 Where the biblical reference is simple and replete, the species Homo sapiens, of the genus Homo, of the family Hominidae, of the superfamily Hominoidea, of the suborder Anthropoidea, of the order Primates, of the cohort Unguiculata, of the infraclass Eutheria, of the class Mammalia, of the phylum Chordata, of the kingdom Animalia is more complex.19
Let us stay, for the moment, with the more classical, scientific view. From geologic records, the universe is estimated to be around fifteen billion years old. The earth, as a planetary structure, is thought to be over four billion years old, with almost ninety percent of this time lost in what is called the Precambrian period. No evidence of fossil life on earth is found until that of plant remains in the Paleozoic Era (Lower Paleolithic Age) from about 590 Myr (590 million years) to 248 Myr. The geologic eras which follow are the Mesozoic Era (Middle Paleolithic Age) from 248 Myr to 65 Myr, and the Cenozoic Era (Upper Paleolithic Age) from 65 Myr to around 8,000 B.C.20
The evolution of man during this period of time can be discerned through reconstruction of various fossilized remains. Mammals first appeared in the Mesozoic Era about 165 million years ago. Primates, the order which includes the species of human beings, arose about forty million years ago during the Cenozoic Era.21 The precursor of the ape family, Aegyptopithecus, developed during the Miocene Epoch, from about 24 Myr to 5 Myr,22 and one of the earliest recognizable precursors of man within this grouping, Ramapithecus, lived around 15 Myr.23
The formation of the actual family of modern man, Homindae, occurred during the Pliocene epoch which lasted until about 1.8 Myr. At the end of this period the first true hominids, sufficiently human to go by the name of Homo, emerged.24 The first hominids are now dated to around 4.5 Myr, while the earliest members of the genus Homo likely evolved from its more apelike predecessor, Australopithecus, around 2.5 Myr.25 One of these creatures, Homo habilis, was an ape that walked upright around 2.5 Myr and then developed by 1.5 Myr into Homo erectus, the first member of the Homo line to move out of Africa.26 This species included the Java man and Pekin man. The Australopithecus genus, discovered in South Africa, was a similar hominid that developed around the same period of time.
The Pliocene Epoch ended, and the Pleistocene began, as ice started to spread and cover a large part of the northern hemisphere.27 During this period of time, about 200,000 to 400,000 years ago, Homo sapiens finally begun to appear and thrive. Neanderthal remains clearly identify social groupings of men, and corroborate the use of primitive tools, and even artistic renderings, that are consistent with a quite advanced cooperative gathering.
Why is all this dry archaeologic information necessary to relate as we begin to dissect out the history of infanticide? It is simply to recognize that our modern genetic heritage did not commence when Columbus discovered America. Despite the rapid advances made in our understanding of the physical and social sciences, our basic nature has been affected by more than a few hundred years of growth. These ancient ancestors can provide clues as to why we react to stress the way we do, and whether those methods are reasonable or aberrant.
While scientists generally agree over the basic evolution of man in the fossil record, we still know little of how these early humans actually lived. It appears obvious that this was an age that required incredible fortitude to survive, and it seems reasonable to assume that emphasis was placed on physical strength, rather than philosophical convictions, to aid in food gathering and defense. Ethical tenets were likely few in number, and superstition guided placation of whatever supernatural forces, or deities, did exist. The value of a helpless newborn's life in this uncertain environment was not very great, and little time could be wasted in protecting those who could not contribute to the welfare of the social group.
While the premise of our modern age has generally been to consider infants to have natural rights equal to those of adults, early man was faced with survival limitations that required a more harsh and realistic view. It was an existence that truly fit the premise of ""survival of the fittest"" and, in the words of J. M. Rist: “It was almost universally held in antiquity that a child has no intrinsic right to life in virtue of being born.28 If there were means available to allow for survival, so be it. If not, then life must go on and society did not find the killing of a neonate a criminal act.
Passive death of newborns from neglect by parents who were busy with other tasks must have been prominent, in addition to direct elimination of unwanted births. The primary motive for these killings was the difficulty in rearing children while living the harsh reality of a hunter-gatherer life. The food supply was not only unpredictable, it was mobile. If a family was to maintain a proper habitat near the traveling herd, they had to be able to move quickly whenever the need arose. It was especially difficult to care for a newborn infant during these periods of rapid change. A mother who was feeding one child at her breast could not afford to wean the infant until it was three or four years old and, therefore, any other babies born during this interval would have to be abandoned.
Williamson estimated that during this period of time, infanticide rates of 15-20% were prevalent.29 Birdsell gives a somewhat higher rate, ranging from 15-50% of the total number of births. He believed that ""systematic infanticide has been a necessary procedure for spacing human children"" which persisted until the development of advanced agriculture.30 Neel, using the present day Yanomama Indians as a model of how life was likely to have been in prehistoric times, estimated that the infanticide rate was 15-20%.31 He cautioned against moralizing about this large figure, since the rate might seem excessive to our modern concepts. He added that:
Accepting the general harshness of the milieu in which primitive man functioned, I find it increasingly difficult to see in the recent reproductive history of the civilized world a greater respect for the quality of human existence than was manifested by our remote ""primitive"" ancestors.32
If our forefathers had to practice infanticide, it was because of the hardness of their life, rather than the hardness of their heart.33 It was not anger that led them to strangle or expose their children, it was the only way they could assure that the other members of a family could survive.
The aborigines of Australia manifest a lifestyle that also approximates this earlier prehistoric era. The Australoids are hunter-gatherers who rely on healthy women to help in the search for food. Mothers can carry only one suckling child with them during their travels in the bush, and children born during the time an older sibling needs care are generally killed.34 In addition, during periods of drought and famine, younger children are often not provided enough food to maintain their life, or are eaten in order to provide nourishment to older siblings and parents.35 Reports on the incidence of infanticide in these Australian tribes have ranged as high as 30% of all live-births.36
While the usual picture of life in the Stone Age is generally portrayed as a very harsh existence, some researchers have found indications that the travail may have been less bitter. Marvin Harris believed that Paleolithic hunters enjoyed relatively high standards of comfort and security, and were generally well nourished. However he noted that this was only due to a low population density -- between 1600 and 20,00 human beings in all of France during the Stone Age -- and that infanticide had to be used to maintain these minimal numbers.37 He estimated that from 23-50% of children had to be removed at birth in order to preserve the 0.001% population growth that was present at that time.38
In addition to the natural stresses that were placed upon their lives, these early human beings also killed some of their children because of superstition and religious rites. There is a great deal of archaeologic evidence that sacrifices occurred to a variety of gods and goddesses during this era. Lubbock described archaeologic remains which included burnt bones indicating the practice of infanticide in pagan Britain.39 At Ofnethohlen, in Germany, a mass burial from about 20,000 B.C. showed thirty-three skulls of which twenty were children showing signs which suggested some type of sacrifice.40 In the great bas-relief from Laussel, France, where drawings dating back to the Paleolithic era can be found, the figure of a menstruating goddess holding her menstrual blood horn can be seen which has signs indicating she is to be placated by the sacrifice of human infants.41
While these data are obviously contrived from sketchy information, it is easy to understand why parents needed assistance from supernatural sources. As one searches the animal kingdom for variations in pre-pubertal growth, the human species is unique in the long interval between fertilization and puberty. No other animal spends so much time in maturing to full adulthood, and although this likely aids the development of certain positive human attributes, a very large burden is placed on the human mother for the feeding and safekeeping of her child. During the first four or five years of life, a single child would ultimately control most of the available time a female had for rearing during the pre-agricultural era. No matter how much the parents may have wished to raise two children simultaneously, their way of life made such a desire prohibitive.
Much of this dependency changed when the ability to provide adequate food in a specific geographical area became widely available. With the development of effective agricultural techniques, communities of many families were formed which would assure mutual assistance to aide in the rearing of children. This arose independently in three areas of the world: the fertile crescent area in the eastern Mediterranean region around the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers; a second center in China; and a third in Central America.42 The more popular scientific determination of when these farming communities were established was somewhere around 8500 B.C.43 There were signs of agricultural workings as early as 7000 B.C. in Mesopotamia, and 5000 B.C. in Egypt.44
As agriculture became more prominent, food became more plentiful.45 Around 3000 B.C., with the development of the harder and more durable bronze alloy of copper and tin, it became possible to develop very extensive societies with weaponry that enabled land already tilled to be defended, and additional acres acquired.46 Man was now beginning to tear away from the restraints placed upon him by his natural environment.
Along with the security from a more stable food supply, however, came the threat of an even more ominous disaster - famine. While certain years brought an abundance of food, others seemed to be even worse than before. A large crop harvest would initially promote the feeding of larger numbers of people, and as a result there were fewer deaths and an increased population density. But the uncertainty of each years harvest would put these survivors at even greater risk in the future. If food was scarce at any particular time, it was, by necessity, the welfare of the adults which came first. Without proper manpower to both harvest, and defend, the food supply, all the citizens in a gathering would be in danger of losing their lives. Following adults, the older children were cared for next as they provided necessary assistance in the harvesting of food. The youngest children were provided for only if there was surplus food. At the bottom of the list, helpless and unable to offer material help, came the newborns. When times of stress appeared, they were routinely thrown into rivers, flung into trenches, and exposed on every hill and roadside, ""a prey for birds, food for wild beasts to rend.""47
But it was not only the precarious nature of their day-to-day life which led our ancestors to commit infanticide, it was also superstition and fear. The gods of Paleolithic times ""did not exist to be loved, but to be placated,"" usually by the sacrifice of animals, but also of humans as well.48 Life was not sacrosanct in those distant times, and the power of the gods had to be assuaged.
The early pagan gods were ornery and not only quick to kill humankind, but also their own. In the Akkadian creation epic of Mesopotamia, from the early second millennium B.C., the story was told of the gods Apsu and Mummu-Tiamat who begot the next generation of gods. The clamor of these children infuriated Apsu, who found the noise loathsome. He vowed to destroy them so ""that quiet may be restored.""49 His wife admonished this coarse response and demanded that the children be treated with kindness for although ""their ways indeed are most troublesome"" we should still attend them amiably.50
Male gods, however, continued to shun paternal control. In the Zoroastrian mythology, the first human couple grew from the seed of Gayomart. When offspring appeared, the parents devoured the children rather than raise them. Finally, the Wise Lord took away the sweetness of children and then Mashye and Mashyane gave birth to the human race.51 A similar fable was seen in the Greek legend of Zeus and Cronos, described in more detail in a later chapter. Cronos swallowed each of his children as they were born, and only the cunning action of Rhea, the mother, saved Zeus from certain destruction.
We therefore find that the earliest religions included gods who treated their offspring, not with love and kindness, but with jealousy and fear. Children could encompass an image of danger, and it was necessary, at times, to destroy them if survival of the parent was threatened. This lesson, according to the historical record, was not lost upon subsequent mortal believers.
B. Ancient Greece
While the valley of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers have historically been identified as the location of the origin of the Garden of Eden, and the resultant birth of mankind, Western civilization looks more to the Golden Age of Greece for the cultural beginnings of ""modern"" civilization. In those heroic days, when gods and men performed the deeds which were to become models of courageous behavior for centuries afterward, we uncover the first concrete evidence of infanticide that was socially accepted at the time.
Archaeologic support for the presence of man on the Greek mainland dates back to the sixth or seventh millennium B.C., during the Mesolithic period, and in Crete to about the fourth millennium B.C., during the Neolithic Period.52 It is generally believed that the first Greek speaking, Indo-European tribes began to appear in mainland Greece about 1900 B.C., at the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age.53
The first civilization which appears to have widely flourished in the area surrounding the Aegean Sea was that of the Minoans in Crete. This kingdom, where the legendary Minotaur resided, was ruled by king Minos and became a vast regional power before suddenly disappearing in a violent destruction around 1400 B.C. It was followed on the Greek mainland by the Myceneans whose military general, Agamemnon, was famous as the leader of the Greeks during the Trojan War. The Myceneans reached the height of their power around 1600 B.C. and then, as the Minoans before them, seemed to abruptly disappear around 1200 B.C. Traditional Greek history dates from 776 B.C., the year the quadrennial Olympic games in honor of Zeus were said to be founded, and the date which provided a calendar for future events.54 It was during this classical Hellenic era that we see the first widespread documentation of infanticide within large populations of otherwise sophisticated, and educationally advanced, peoples. That the Greeks practiced the exposure of at least some of their children is generally accepted.55 Although Isocrates, writing in 342 B.C., said that the Athenians were not guilty of exposure or infanticide, his view is in the extreme minority.56 The popular view, as W. K. Lacey aptly summarized, was that: ""There can be no doubt whatever that the exposure of surplus children was practiced through antiquity.""57 The only significant disagreement among historians is on the extent of the practice.58
Parental control of the Greek father over the life of his child was absolute. As early as the sixth century B.C., the Cretan Law Code of Gortyn verified the extent of this authority. If a wife was separated from her husband and bore a child, she would bring it to her husband in the presence of three witnesses. If the husband should not receive it then ""the child shall be in the mother’s power either to rear or expose.""59 It was the father who ultimately directed whether his child would live or die.
This extreme power was typical of the general format of parental authority in most ancient societies throughout the world. Newborns did not automatically become part of a family simply by being born; they rather were admitted only if the father desired to keep the child and undertake the tribulation of rearing it to adulthood. Solon, who lived from 640-560 B.C., was a statesman who laid the constitutional foundations of Athenian democracy. While generally seen as a legal reformer, he nevertheless agreed that the Athenian father had the legal right to slay his own child.60 Aristotle described this control over children as similar to that of a king over his subjects. It was not dependent upon constitutional laws, like the power which a Greek husband had over his wife, but was rather part of the rational process which nature gave to men in order to assure the family would remain strong.61 To the Greeks, a strong state could only be assured by strong heads of strong families, and the husband stood at the front of this paternalistic line.
If the Athenian father desired to keep his newborn infant, he would formally acknowledge the child as his own at the dekate on the tenth day after birth.62 If the child was unwanted, it was not usually killed outright but was rather exposed under legal sanction.63 This power of the Greek father resided whether the child was that of his wife, or of some slave or concubine. The Roman father had less authority in this regard, and could only control the fate of his legitimate children.64 A child could not be exposed after the Amphidromia, a family ceremony where the child was carried around the hearth by the nurse and given a name.65
In addition to choosing whether the newborn should live or die, the Athenian father could also have his child killed as punishment for various crimes. An Ethiopian Romance, the third century A.D. novel by Heliodorus, describes how a father brought a charge of assault against his son in Athens. Although he eventually allowed the assembly to decide the choice of punishment, he told how ""the law permits me to execute him with my own hand.""66
While any child could theoretically be done away with under this theory of law, the majority of newborns that were killed by Greek parents were either deformed, illegitimate, or born to parents who could not afford to raise them.67 Despite the fact that the Homeric Greeks were usually described as wealthy, the average Athenian family lived on a day-to-day basis, hoping that there would be adequate amounts of food to maintain their sustenance. There were times when another mouth could simply not be fed and the newborn would be exposed with little social pressure or threats of criminal misconduct.
There were also instances where the Greeks were not as compassionate with their children as one might have expected from a society that gave rise to the principles of democracy and the pride of friendship. They had opened the eyes of the world to the rights of free speech and the privilege of voting for one's leaders, but their behavior did not always follow the sweetness of their voice. Polybius, in his Histories, explained that the low birth rate in Greece during the second century B.C. was not due to war, or epidemics, but rather to the fact that: “Men had fallen into such a state of pretentiousness, avarice and indolence that they did not wish to marry, or if they married to rear the children born to them, or at most as a rule but one or two of them.”68 It seems that the Greek male looked more to the pleasures of the present, than to the responsibilities of the future.
Such attributes, which seem so degrading to us today, were not considered unusual at the time. Even the Greek gods acted in similar ways which indicated that the moral examples of the deity were not necessarily being disobeyed. The liturgy of Greek religion is literally filled with episodes of incest and infanticide. If even a god acted in such a way, how could anyone complain when a mortal followed the superior model?
According to Greek mythology, Cronos (Saturn), the first powerful God who ruled the Heavens above, was warned by Gaia and Ouranos that some day he would be defeated by one of his own sons.69 In a fashion that was to become commonplace among gods and kings alike when such portents were given, Cronos decided to eliminate his destined fate by killing his children at birth. In this way no son would ever be allowed to live to an age to harm him. As his fertile wife Rhea then delivered a baby, year after year, he ""gulped down"" each one as if they were a pitted olive.70 In almost endless grief, Rhea gave birth to Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Pluto and Poseidon and then watched as Cronos swallowed each one immediately after they were born.71 Finally, Rhea developed a plan to save her next child from destruction. She decided that immediately after birth she would substitute a huge stone in swaddling clothes for the real child, and then give it to Cronos to swallow. When her next baby son, Zeus, was born, the ruse worked and Cronos swallowed the stone and was satiated with the belief that the baby was destroyed. Zeus was then secretly sent to Ida to be raised away from his father's sight. In order to drown out his cries, which would have warned Cronos of the subterfuge, the Curetes and Corybantes beat on their shields and helmets to make noise.72 Zeus was saved, but his father was to pay dearly for the rescue.
The foundation for future animosity between Greek parent and child was clearly set within the legends of their gods. When Zeus was grown, he returned to defeat his father and imprison him in an underground cave, proving the feared prophecy true. Little wonder then that a young Greek father might have second thoughts over the wisdom of raising a son which the seers have warned of possible trouble. Future myths of gods, and stories of mortals, would carry on this same infanticidal theme pointing out how one's progeny could become one's heirs if they were not carefully watched and controlled.
The Greeks may have learned some impious lessons from the life styles of their gods, but they also had to face the reality of an extremely hard life here on earth. Estimates of infant mortality in Greek society, from non-criminal causes, ran as high as 30-40%.73 Even the most devoted and caring parent lost young children to medical illness and accidental death, and a stoic attitude about the frailty of one's offspring was a necessity. ""Parents who lose children must be satisfied with the cold comfort that they can have new ones,"" was an attitude that was prevalent.74 When you learned to live with this much death, the disappearance of a neighbor's newborn child was not an event of great social concern.
As an adjunct to this cold reality, there was little societal gain from allowing a disabled child, who could not ever fare for itself, to live forever dependent on the benevolent care of others. From the earliest legal codes in Greece, the lives of such infants were not protected under the law, and in some cases they were actually encouraged to be killed. Plutarch related that the law of Lycurgus in Sparta reasoned that the life ""of that which nature had not well equipped at the very beginning for health and strength, was no advantage either to itself or the state.""75 And where there was no advantage in the ancient world, there was no protection. The Greeks used infanticide to rectify the mistakes of Nature and were thereby saved from problems of defective heredity.76
Much of this tolerance toward infanticide was reflected in the writings of the Greek philosophers and playwrights. Plato, the student of Socrates and teacher of Aristotle, wrote of Grecian life around the middle of the fourth century B.C. His Discourses are often cited as evidence for the frequent occurrence of infanticide during that era, but his treatises must be interpreted cautiously for they show great variation and often refer to the ""ideal,"" rather than the ""real,"" state of affairs.
Plato has been cited, for example, as justifying the use of infanticide to limit the size of the state.77 However, in Laws he actually suggested that measures may have to be taken in order to keep the number of households in the state at 5040, and that there are measures available to check propagation beyond that critical level. While discussing the use of exposure, he also noted that one method would be to send out colonies of people that seem suitable to outside lands.78 This ancient device of colonization had long been used by a number of countries to control their population growth, and did not require the purposeful elimination of any offspring. It would be wrong to look at only one section of his work without reference to the entirety.
There are, nevertheless, many notations in the works of Plato to show at least a fundamental acceptance of the use of exposure, or infanticide, under certain circumstances. Plato was well aware of the serious burden which could be placed on society by unlimited increases in the size of the population. More than two millennium before Malthus outlined how populations grew geometrically, and the food supply only arithmetically, Plato showed an understanding of this problem in The Republic. If the population increased beyond a desired amount, he warned, the lives of all citizens would be endangered.79 The State should instead preserve an equitable balance by assuring that the suitable number of inhabitants would be maintained. How this would occur was not discussed in that particular passage, but disposal of neonates would have been an acceptable option.
Plato was also concerned that the population be primarily sustained by healthy children. He wrote in The Republic that in the ideal commonwealth the procreation of children would be similar to the raising of horses or dogs: “There is a need for the best men to have intercourse as often as possible with the best women, and the reverse for the ordinary men with the most ordinary women; and the offspring of the former must be reared but not that of the others if the flock is going to be of the most eminent quality.”80 With ethnic cleansing still present in our modern age, it should not surprise us that even the Golden Age of Greece looked with favor on only a few of its citizens. While Plato may have realized the pragmatic and political value of philosophical tenets, he clearly retained a segregational attitude about the value of individual life.
Plato concurred that parents retained extreme authority over the lives of their children, but there was evidence in some of his works that such parental control was not without some limitation. In Laws, he explained that if a parent killed a child in a fit of rage, there was the need for purification and exile for three years and then the wife and husband must be separated and never again have a child.81 It was the anger, rather than a reasoned decision to dispose of an offspring, that appears to have been the issue here so that the parent's power was subject to some scrutiny when rational thought was interrupted by irrational behavior.
Aristotle, the pupil of Plato and tutor of Alexander the Great, also clearly accepted the concept of infanticide for certain select situations. He steadfastly agreed with the disposal of deformed infants at birth. In Politics he stated directly: ""Let there be a law that no deformed child shall live.""82 If the need to control the numbers of children who were born was because of excess population, however, he argued for the use of abortion rather than exposure after birth.83 Aristotle's philosophical principle of reasoned action and natural law did not require heroic efforts to keep infants alive when there was little chance of independent existence.
In Sparta, one of the stronger independent Greek states, a more socialistic approach to family life was taken. Where Athens became the model of democracy, Sparta promoted the importance of the state over that of the individual. Lycurgus, the lawgiver of Sparta, was well aware of the inherent power of the Athenian father, but found this to be in conflict with the primary needs of the state. He believed that the father did not have the power to dispose of the child as he wished, because children were seen as the property of the whole commonwealth and not only the parents.84 It was therefore up to the government to decide whether a particular infant should live or die, and not the biologic father. If the authorities felt that the infant would be of value, then it would be proper for them to demand that the child be raised. This decision was made at the Lesche where the elders would carefully view a child brought to them by the father. If they found it well-built and sturdy, they would order it reared. If the infant was ill-born and deformed, however, they would order it brought to the Apothetae, a chasm at the foot of Mount Taygetus, where it was abandoned or thrown off a cliff.85 Sparta was known for its athletic and disciplined youth; there was no place among them for the sick or infirm. Infanticide offered a solution to their eugenic concerns by eliminating the unfit at birth.86
This rigorous approach toward the ideal Spartan state carried on in the disciplining of Spartan children as well. Even at a young age, the child was expected to endure whippings and regimented control in order to assure that they developed the strength to survive the rigors of life on their own. This led to the modern day usage of the word ""spartan"" to mean a life without frills and unnecessary comfort. At times, it led to no life at all.
Of all the Greek states, some have postulated that only Thebes did not reveal any evidence of infanticide.87 C. W. Westrup, however, pointed out that Thebes had to forbid exposure by threatening the punishment of pain. If anyone wanted to get rid of a child for economic reasons, they were ""allowed to hand it over to a magistrate who then awarded it as a slave to the first bidder.""88 This obviously was in response to episodes of exposure which were occurring at the time, and would tend to disprove their prior claims of innocence.
C. Roman Empire
The first settlements of early Italians in the Tiber Valley occurred around the first millennium B.C., and culminated with the mythical founding of Rome by Romulus in the second year of the seventh Olympiad, at about 751 B.C.89 After the death of Romulus, Rome was ruled by kings until 510 B.C. when Tarquin, the seventh and last king, was expelled for tyranny. A Republic was then set up and one of the first acts to follow was the writing of the Twelve Tables (Lex Duodecim Tabularum), the famous document which initiated the development of Roman Law. It was this legal system, more than any other, that formed the underlying principles of law in most Western countries today.
The traditional account of the genesis of the Twelve Tables is that three commissioners were sent from Rome to the Greek states in order to collect what was deemed useful in their various legal systems. They returned in 452 B.C. and ten decemvirs, or magistrates, were then given one year to frame a body of laws for the newly formed Republic. At first they made ten tables, and then added two more the following year. The laws were approved by the senate and then engraved on columns in the most conspicuous part of the Forum.90 The populace was summoned to read them, and to be responsible for knowing, and following, the agreed upon decrees in their everyday lives.91
These tablets were held in strict regard by the Roman people. In 44 B.C., Cicero lamented how he was required, as a child, to learn all the laws but that nowadays no one bothered to do the same. Tacitus admired the Twelve Tables and regretted that they were ""the last specimen of equitable legislation.""92 To a man, every Roman author for centuries thereafter only referred to these principles with honor and respect.
And while the hallowed chambers of law courts today still resound with references of respect to this famous collection of legal standards, within the body of the revered document lay the authority for a Roman father to decide the life or death of his child from birth. The Twelve Tables clearly directed this intent: “Let a father have the power of life and death over his legitimate children, and let him sell them when he pleases.”93 With respect to abnormal infants, the directive for eugenic action was more explicit: “If a father has a child born, which is monstrously deformed, let him kill him immediately.”94 If a Roman father wished to expose his child at birth, he had the authority of statutory law to do so. The Romans considered many of these abnormal births as evil portents, and thought that the disaster could be prevented by killing the child. The birth of a hermaphrodite was included in this category.95
This prerogative of the Roman father, known as the ""patriae potestas,"" contained the ultimate power of life and death over legitimate offspring and was conferred upon him with the sanction of a lex regia.96 The privilege was extended only to the man, and if a mother killed her child, she could be found guilty of the even more severe crime of parricide. The punishment for this crime was like no other, and consisted of being
“sewed up in a sack with a dog, a cock, a viper, and an ape, and enclosed in this horrible prison he is to be, according to the nature of the place, thrown into the sea, or into a river.”97 Despite this terrible threat, many women obviously disposed of their newborns as reflected by the Roman playwright, Plautus, who had the courtesan Phronesium explain why she needed to pretend to a Babylonian soldier that she gave birth to his child: ""If I let this child of ours live and bring it up, he'll give me all of his property.""98
How could the Roman father be given such unbridled authority? As with the Greeks, life was not an easy one for the average Roman citizen who faced the possibility of death from many causes every day. Medicine was in its infancy, wars were rampant, and food was often scarce. Bruce Frier estimated that only 49% of Roman children saw their fifth birthday.99 Inscriptions on Roman tombs indicate that at least one-third of the population was dead by age ten years, and the average life expectancy was age twenty-two years for men and twenty for women.100 While this applied great pressure against population growth on society as a whole, a man's tenuous domain remained of primary concern.
The usual method of disposing of unwanted infants was abandonment at birth.101 Most historians agree that the extent of exposure among the Romans was very prevalent.102 William Graham Sumner found that ""exceptions to the practice of these vices are noteworthy phenomenon.""103 It affected every class of person and the Romans even regarded it ""remarkable that other nations did not expose children.""104 John Boswell, the Yale historian, estimated that the rate of abandonment at Rome during the first three centuries of the Christian era was about 20-40% of all children born.105 He nevertheless believed that most of these cases were not instances of malevolence, but involved the expectation that the child would be picked up by some other person and saved by ""the kindness of strangers."" To Boswell, this was preferable to actually killing the infant outright at birth.106
The expectation that the exposed baby could live and be raised by another family, was certainly one reason why the Romans frequently utilized abandonment as the preferred means to eliminate an unwanted newborn. The possibility of such an event was engraved in the very history of the founding of Rome itself. According to legend, Rome was established by twin boys, Romulus and Remus, who had been ordered exposed at their birth ""in accordance with an ancestral custom.""107
From that time forward, exposure was a prominent feature of Roman life. Virgil, writing of his visit to the underworld in the Aenead, recorded his untoward reaction to the numbers of newborns he found wallowing in the depths of Hell: “Here voices and loud lamentations echo: the souls of infants weeping at the very first threshold - torn away by the black day, deprived of their sweet life, ripped from the breast, plunged into bitter death.”108 It is hard not to shudder with the intensity of Virgil's indignation at the gruesome event he witnessed. Lucian, in ""Voyage to the Lower World,"" told how the invoice of new arrivals listed three hundred babies, ""including those that were exposed.""109 According to literary sources, Roman Purgatory was no stranger to innocent newborn babes.
The Roman father's authority to decide whether his children lived began even before the baby was born. When a woman became pregnant, she had to notify her husband within thirty days of diagnosing her condition. Once this was done: “If he does not send people to watch and examine her and does not state before witnesses that she is not pregnant by him, he will be forced to recognize the child when it is born.”110 This meant that a father could not later claim that an infant was illegitimate, and refuse to be responsible for its care, if he did not do so when first notified by the prospective mother.
While the Roman father was not legally required to raise any of his offspring, there was an encouragement from the time of Augustus to produce heirs and increase the privileged class.111 Since so many children failed to reach the age of majority, there were often times when heirs would have to be sought through adoption or other artificial means. This practice was particularly common among the ruling class. In 9 A.D., Augustus introduced various reforms which would penalize the unmarried male and encourage the raising of children.112 While lessening the exposure of well-to-do infants, this action likely increased the abandonment by poorer parents who rightfully expected that there was a better chance that their child might be adopted by wealthy families looking to take advantage of these economic benefits. If a young married woman of means did not want to undergo the rigors, and real danger, of pregnancy, she could always send her servant to find an exposed child and begin a family with ease.
In the early years of the Roman Republic, the unwanted newborns were often brought to a column near the Velabrum - the traditional location for exposure. They were left on display in the open for speculators who sometimes took them to sell as prostitutes or slaves.113 Sextus Pompeius Festus referred to the columns in the market place as lactaria or ""nursing columns,"" because people would bring their nursing infants there to be deposited.114 Boswell believed that most children left at these settings were found promptly and reared by others.115
Because of his unique power of patriae potestas, the Roman father could easily choose the type of child he wished to keep. As with the Greeks, the Romans put a premium on healthy male heirs; others were not treated as kindly. Romulus was said to have formulated the nature of this practice when he “obliged the inhabitants to bring up all their male children and the first born of the females, and forbade them to destroy any children under three years of age unless they were maimed or monstrous from their very birth.”116 He added the requirement that before the child was destroyed it should be sanctioned by five nearby related neighbors.117 It is questionable whether this latter addendum was put into practice by the populace.118
Soranus, the eminent Greek physician who practiced in Rome during the second century A.D., discussed at length the appropriate treatment of the newborn infant during that period of time. He noted that Hippocrates refused to give women abortives because ""it is the specific task of medicine to guard and preserve what has been engendered by nature.""119 He mentioned, however, that not all physicians during that era agreed with this restriction, and in his treatise he discussed the various methods which a woman might use to help induce an abortion.120
In his section “On the Care of the Newborn,” Soranus included a discussion on “How to Recognize the Newborn that is Worth Rearing”:
Now the midwife, having received the newborn, should first put it upon the earth, having examined beforehand whether the infant is male or female, and should make an announcement by signs as is the custom of women. She should also consider whether it is worth rearing or not. And the infant which is suited by nature for rearing will be distinguished by the fact that its mother has spent the period of pregnancy in good health, for conditions which require medical care, especially those of the body, also harm the fetus and enfeeble the foundations of its life.121
Despite his clear moral acceptance of disposing of unsatisfactory infants at birth, Soranus remains today the acknowledged founder of the specialty of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Modern practitioners may debate whether physicians should serve as executioners for the state when the death penalty has been imposed on a convicted felon, or whether physicians should morally perform abortions when it is the choice of a woman not to give birth, or whether euthanasia is appropriate on a terminal cancer patient, but it is unlikely that many physicians in Roman times were dissuaded from following the precepts of Soranus because of similar ethical concerns.
Although the Romans were heavily involved in the exposure of their own children, they nevertheless attempted to combat the rising numbers of Christian converts by charges that children were being killed in various sacrificial rites. Minucius answered these charges by noting that it was the practice of the Romans ""to expose your very own children to birds and wild beasts, or at times to smother and strangle them.""122 While expounding on how the Christian God would never accept the killing of a human in this manner, he pointed out that it was the Roman deities, and especially Saturn, who would devour their children.123
But the complacency of the Roman hierarchy to infanticide began to change around the time of Christ. Epictetus, born in 50 A.D., asked that since ""sheep and wolves do not abandon their offspring, how can we?""124 Ovid, in the poem ""Heroides,"" dolefully questioned the exposure of the bastard child of Canace by her father. ""What crime could the babe commit,"" he appealed, ""with so few hours of life?""125
As poets and philosophers progressively highlighted the immorality of infanticide, legislators and emperors began to modify the legal right of a father to harm his child at will. In 52 B.C., the lex Pomepeia de Parricidiis held that if a man ""hastens on the fate of an ascendant or a son, or in any way attempts anything included under the designation parricidium, he shall be punished with the penalty of parricidium.""126 Prior to this time, Roman women could be convicted of killing their child, since the patriae potestas was restricted to men, but now the process was extended for murder to the father as well. Ulpian, a Roman jurist from 211-222 A.D., had indicated that ""a father cannot kill his son without giving him a hearing but must accuse him before the prefect or provincial governor.""127 In addition, in the views of Paul, a person who abandoned a child was equated with one who smothered it to death.128
There was also a progressive attempt to encourage the raising of offspring, instead of abandoning them, by providing monetary assistance to families in need. Pliny the Younger, in the second century A.D., recorded how laws were passed to encourage the rearing of children ""by high rewards and comparable penalties.""129 This referred to the efforts of Augustus to encourage marriage and raising of families by laying heavy disabilities on unmarried men and extending special privileges to fathers of three children in the Lex Papia-Poppaea of 9 A.D.130 Pliny then praised the Emperor Trajan, who reigned from 98-117 A.D., for ""you are a prince whose reign makes it both pleasure and profit to rear children.""131 He added that the safety of the country from outside marauders was also a necessary concern for ""there is indeed great encouragement to have children in the promise of allowances and donations, but greater still when there is hope of security and freedom from fear.""132 When the fate of the entire populace was at stake, the life of even a newborn child needed protection.
Emperor Constantine the Great, the first Christian ruler, commanded that the public had to maintain the children of those who were unable to provide for them in order to prevent the murder, or exposure, of infants due to poverty. In 315 A.D. he ordered relief be given to those who claimed they were unable to pay these costs.133 This program was similar to what later would become foundling hospitals in the Middle Ages, and was comprised into the Theodosian Code, although it was rejected in Justinian's collection.134 This legislation was not very effective, however, for in 329 A.D., Constantine allowed parents to once again sell children if there were insufficient means to care for them.135
Although some attempts were made to pay parents to keep children alive to replenish the diminishing Roman population in the two centuries following Augustus,136 the law did not clearly change until the statement in a letter from Emperor Constantine to Varinus, Viceregent of Africa on the 11th of the Kalends of Dec, 319 A.D., that ""if anyone should hasten the end of either of his parents, his son, (or) his daughter,"" he shall suffer the penalty of parricide.137 While mentioned earlier as a possible punishment for women who killed their children, this ruling broadly extended the force of the law. It is generally referred to as the moment when the Roman Empire finally outlawed exposure and infanticide as criminal acts.
D. Persian Empire
Arabia is a primary geological formation of southwest Asia that extends for about one million square miles. From the third millennium B.C. onwards, the peoples of this region pushed northward under the pressures of drought and famine, and took over control of the lands they entered. In Sumeria, they became the Babylonians; in Syria and Phoenicia they evolved as Canaanites, Hebrews and Arameans.138 They were called Semitic people because of their language and were thought to have descended from Shem, the eldest son of Noah. Their religion was generally of the primitive type, and deities associated with the natural surroundings were frequently worshiped. These gods were charged with the power to compel the service of man, and failure to appease them could result in tragedy and death.139
Persia, or the area now known as Iran, was populated around the middle of the sixth century B.C. from a clan of the Hakhamanish who spoke an Indo-European dialect and overthrew the native dynasty of the Susa. Soon thereafter, Cyrus came to power and greatly expanded the boundaries of what would then be known as the Persian Empire.140
As we have seen with the founding of Rome by Romulus and Remus, Cyrus was also the victim of a forced exposure. He was the son of Mandane, the daughter of king Astyages. Before his birth, Astyages dreamt of a vine that grew from Mandane and covered all of Asia after her marriage to Cambyses. He asked an oracle of the meaning of this dream and was told that the child of Mandane would eventually rule in his place.141 When Cyrus was born, Astyages took note of this prophecy and ordered his servant Harpagus to kill the infant by exposure. Harpagus then directed Mitradates, a slave, to expose the boy but when Mitradates took the infant into the woods, he became too compassionate to perform the deed and instead raised Cyrus as his own son.142 When Cyrus was grown, he overthrew Astyages and became the ruler of Persia. Once again, as had happened with Cronus, a portentous dream proved true despite attempts to escape the Fates by the commission of infanticide.
The Persian kings demanded much devotion from their followers, and the safety of the country was often put above the welfare of one's own child. Herodotus related how Xeres praised his commander Boges who was under an intense siege in Eion by the Greek general, Cimon. When the food in the town had run out, Boges scattered the gold and silver and then ""piled up a great pyre and slew and cast into the fire his children and wife and concubines and servants.""143 Before Cimon could enter the town and capture him, Boges threw himself on the pyre as well. The willingness of the Persians to lay down their life in the service of their revered ruler was legendary, even in the days before Islam.
But the most enduring memory of infants killed in this part of the world was the beastly record of widespread female infanticide. The Persian hierarchy was dominated by males, as was much of the world at that time, and a preference for sons reached lethal proportions. Before the time of Mohammed it was not unusual for daughters to be buried alive, either immediately after birth or later in childhood.144 The problem was not restricted to one specific area but was common all over Arabia.145 A common proverb held that it was a ""generous deed to bury a female child.""146 Avner Giladi concluded that: “The practice of infanticide was deeply rooted among the inhabitants of Arabian peninsula in pre-Islamic times for ritual purposes, social reasons (females) and economic and demographic reasons.”147
There was also disposal of children who were deformed or unable to be maintained at birth.148 While the customs were generally followed with little restraint, it was said that the only occasion on which Othman ever shed a tear was when his little daughter, who he was burying alive, wiped the dust of the grave earth from his beard.149 In the chapter which follows, the effect of Islam on this custom will be further amplified.

CHAPTER II.
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND - THE INFLUX OF RELIGION
""Here is my final conclusion, fear God and obey his commandments, for this is the entire duty of man. For God will judge us for everything we do, including every hidden thing, good or bad.""1
As we have seen, the Golden Age of Greece may have witnessed the birth of grand philosophical and cultural advancements that spread slowly to encompass much of the world, but it did little to protect the lives of its vulnerable children who were born to the renowned citizenry. Treated as chattel, the newborn infant often faced a life in antiquity that was more a cacophony of abuse than a harmony of tender care. Parents were not subject to legal requisites in their care of children, and if the value of infant life was ever to be equated with that of a healthy adult, a more potent caution than societal mores and taboos would have to be found. A satisfactory solution was eventually to be uncovered in religion's threat of an eternal afterlife of pain in Hell.
As reflected in the biblical passage from Ecclesiastes above, crime could possibly be hidden from secular authorities with appropriate stealth and camouflage, but one could never escape punishment in the final judgment of the All-knowing, Almighty Lord. Abraham, the grand biblical Patriarch, fathered the development of three major religions -- Christianity, Judaism, and Islam -- and each one utilized the threat of everlasting torture to foster moral behavior in their frightened adherents. As Ezekial was to warn the Jews who turned away from God's commandments, and worshiped false idols, that their corpses will be set in front of those idols, and:
Your survivors will think of me among the nations where they are held captive, how I was grieved at their whoring heart that turned away from me, and at their eyes that whored after their idols; they will loathe themselves for the evil things they did, their abominations of every sort. And they shall realize that not for nothing did I, YWYH, declare that I would do this evil to them.2
While the methodology may have been crude, these great creeds of life finally provided the newborn infant with some modicum of protection. As the progeny of God Himself, rather than the property of a mortal parent, the life of a child was considered equally valuable to that of an adult; if infants were not properly cared for, the fury of the Almighty would be forthcoming. It was wrath, rather than warmth, which assured appropriate behavior in the frightened, pious subjects.
While ardent faith in the Divine Being has certainly been an integral part of every religious belief throughout recorded history, the key word describing long term success has definitely been ""fear."" Cicero, writing a few decades before the birth of Christ, clearly recognized the effectiveness of this awesome power and posited that the basis for the success of religion was not only worship of the gods, but also the provocation of intense fear.3 Mortal tyrants had only the warning of pain and suffering here on earth to demand obedience from their loyal subjects, but religions threatened an eternity of damnation if the commandments of their particular deity were not followed.
In this role of fearful overseer, judge, executioner and king, God has usually been identified as a ""Father"" in his dealings with mortal man. Sir Thomas More described how the Utopians believed that there was a:
Certain single divinity, unknown, eternal, boundless, inexplicable, beyond the understanding of the human mind, diffused through the whole of this universe in virtue, not bulk. They call him ""the father.""4
So it was with the descendants of Abraham as well. Devout Jews, Christians and Muslims accepted this authority of God and instilled obedience with images of fear. Moses told the people of Israel that God was a ""devouring fire, a jealous God.""5 The message was clear, if you did not follow His laws, you would be destroyed. The warning from Ecclesiastes showed that you cannot hide your actions from God: “For where a man goes is plainly visible to the Lord, And all his paths are under observation.”6
Tertullian, one of the early Christian Church fathers, cautioned that the soul of man knows the Lord and ""if it knows Him, it certainly fears Him.""7 The true believer must follow the teachings of God not only from inner faith and understanding, but also from fear of retribution if the commandments of God were disobeyed. We may have been given the gift of rational thought and free choice as part of our rational being, but as Erasmus explained, Christ the king ""has told us clearly that he who does not stand for Him stands against Him.""8
And for rebellious behavior which arose despite the warnings, punishment was varied, but severe. The classical secular retribution in antiquity was a ""life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.""9 But for religious crimes, even after death the disbeliever continued to be punished in Hell for all eternity. If this prospect was not enough to demand obedience, there was the additional threat of danger to future generations: “When I punish people for their sins, the punishment continues upon the children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren of those who hate me.”10
Many hesitant followers were clearly afraid to take a chance that such warnings were false or misplaced. They obeyed the litany of rules which were promulgated by the mortal messengers of God, and prayed for mercy and forgiveness when some weakness caused them to stray. Others, believing that the institution of the Church was of human, and not supernatural, origin were clearly upset at the dogma which was preached. Thomas Paine, writing in The Age of Reason in 1794 A.D., admonished those that attempted to enslave the free will of man: “All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian, or Turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and to monopolize power and profit.”11 The Church was omnipotent, not by the designation of a Supreme Being, but rather by the same machinations used by tyrants to enslave their own, and other populations, by military force.
These remarks of Paine, like so many other free-thinking critics, may have made for widely read treatises among intellectual minds, but they did not stem the tide of religious growth. A clear belief that all human beings were children of God, and that human life was not to be taken without authority of the Lord, became accepted as if it was a natural consequence of evolutionary growth. Contrary actions were animalistic or barbarian; the concept of patriae potestas as an inherent right of a parent was dead.
This development had inevitable consequences, most of which were beneficial to the survival of children. Prohibition of infanticide and abortion was a feature of Judaeo-Christian morals from the very start. It followed closely upon the apocalyptic traditions of the pagan Orphic tradition.12 The concept of divinely sanctioned inviolability of life held that every human being was born with certain inalienable rights, the chief of which was the right to live, and that man was created in the image of God - ""Image Dei.""13 It was immoral to kill another human being, even if it was only a helpless newborn, because each life was a reflection of the Almighty God. In the words of Pseudo-Phycylides: “A woman should not destroy the unborn babe in her belly, nor after its birth throw it before the dogs and the vultures as a prey.”14
Although the Old Testament never actually forbade the practice of infanticide directly, the religious interpretations which followed were based upon monetary punishment inflicted upon anyone who caused a miscarriage of a pregnant woman: “If two men are fighting, and in the process hurt a pregnant woman so that she has a miscarriage, but she lives, then the man who injured her shall be fined whatever amount the woman's husband shall demand, and as the judges approve.”15
A similar fine was seen in the Code of Hammurabi from about 2250 B.C. If a miscarriage occurred, a fine of ten shekels of silver was levied, while if the woman died, the daughter of the offender was put to death.16 The Middle Assyrian Laws, from about 1300 B.C., held that if a man struck a pregnant woman, and caused the loss of the fetus, then ""he shall pay two talents thirty minas of lead; they shall flog him fifty (times) with staves (and) he shall do the work of the king for one full month.""17 In another section, punishment would include the loss of life.18 The Hittite Laws also declared a fine for causing a miscarriage with ten shekels of silver to be paid if it was in the tenth month, and five shekels if the pregnancy was in the fifth month.19
Just because the teachings of religious leaders in general prohibited the practice of infanticide, however, it did not mean that followers were always uniformly obedient. The Bible is replete with instances of infanticide that brought down intense castigation and warnings of retribution from the prophets, and for centuries thereafter church leaders and writers were faced with the need to continue forbidding, and forewarning, of the deviant practice.
A. Judaism
The precepts of Judaism are contained in the Torah, or Pentateuch, the first five books of the Old Testament. According to tradition, these writings were made by Moses who, just before the Israelites crossed the Jordan River into the Promised Land, “wrote out the laws he had already delivered to the people and gave them to the priests, the sons of Levi, who carried the Ark containing the Ten Commandments of the Lord.”20
Biblical scholars, however, beginning with the work of Spinoza in the seventeenth century A.D., have determined that the Torah was actually written not by Moses but by a number of other sources known as J (Yahwist), E (Elohist), P (Priestly), D (Deuteronomy), and R (Redactors).21 These conclusions have been based on detailed analysis of linguistic characteristics and historical facts.
Whether the Torah is the work of one or many authors, however, its moral lessons have clearly guided the lives of not only Jews, but much of the Western World. Blaise Pascal, the seventeenth century natural philosopher and mathematician who was not a Jew himself, believed that this piece of work was one of the most important to all mankind. He noted that: “The law by which this people is governed is at once the oldest law in the world, the most perfect, and the only one which has been continuously observed in any state.”22 He added: ""I find it strange that the first law in the world should also happen to be the most perfect.""23
In addition to the lessons of Torah scripture, Jewish law is also composed of the writings and teachings of several learned rabbis. This collection, known as the Talmud, was produced in the aftermath of the Roman destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in 70 A.D., and is composed of the Mishnah, a code of law compiled by Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi, and the Gemara, the record of the extensive discussions over the meaning of the Mishnah which took place in rabbinic academies. The time between the completion of the Mishnah, and the completion of the Palestinian Talmud was about two centuries.24 Many other scholars, or Tannaim, had written discussions about the meaning of Scripture, but none achieved the degree of authority of R. Judah.25 There are two versions of the Talmud, one the product of scholars in Babylon, and the other from Palestine.26 Although clearly diverse in many aspects, the two treatises are very similar in form and content due to the interchange of opinions and ideas which transpired during their preparation by emissaries sent between Babylon and Palestine.27 Their area of greatest divergence is in the matter of civil law.28 Where Palestine had become a primarily agricultural society, Babylonia underwent an expansion of commercial trade.29 Many of the severe criminal codes of the Bible were interpreted more leniently in later times in accordance with the humaneness of Pharisaic Judaism.30
For the most part, all of these sources declare that Judaism is a pro-natal tradition which proclaims the messianic notion that someday a child will be born that will enrich and save the human family.31 This faith in a future Savior, rather than the Jesus Christ proclaimed by those Jews who converted to Christianity, gives each new life a precious and divine potential which dictates that no life may be taken by purposeful human action since it could never be known if the loss would be that of the Savior himself. How can any murder be excused when the very future of all of mankind could depend on the life of that one single soul? Every Jew was therefore instructed to rear his family as if the Deliverer might spring from their own seed.
Maimonides, the renowned twelfth century A.D. Jewish philosopher and physician, pointed out that a single man was first created in Genesis, ""to teach us that if any man destroys a single life in the world, scripture imputes it to him as though he had destroyed the whole world.""32 Each life, each spark of being, was a gift of God and only the Holy Father could extinguish its flame.
The teachings of Judaism contrasted with that of classical Greco-Roman thought in ascribing to life a divine origin, not just for its heroes, but for all of mankind. Without having to fable a sexual event between a mortal and a God, the concept of the essence of every human being have a soul from the Lord was unique to Jewish thought. The Greeks and Romans defined the qualities of personhood on judicial grounds, the Jews left the designation to God.33
As a by-product of this reverence for life, directives against murder were repeated in many sections of the Old Testament.34 The prohibition was even extended to cases where one's own life was in mortal danger, and murder of another human being was the only pathway to safety.35 The rabbis reasoned that it would be better to die, and then live in the eternity of time with the good grace of God, then extend your life on earth by committing a forbidden sin.
These precepts against murder, however, extended only to life after completion of the birth process. The fetus under orthodox Jewish law was not considered a person until it was fully born. While it was clear that God was directly responsible for the fetus developing in the womb, intrauterine life was not equated with a living human being.36 The Sages interpreted the Biblical teachings to mean that the commandment to not kill another person could not be construed to mean a fetus.37 If the life of a mother was endangered by hard labor, the fetus could be ""cut up"" while still inside the womb; but if ""the greater part of it was already born,"" then it was not permissible to sacrifice the infant in order to save the mother's life.38 The rationale was that ""the claim of one life cannot override the claim of another life.""39 Under orthodox views, the commandment to not kill existed even if the birth was a creature with a double back or a double spine. If it was an actual birth, and not a miscarriage, ""it has the status of a person and killing it would be considered infanticide which is prohibited.""40
For the Jew who dared to disregard these warnings - beware. If one did not act properly, and did commit murder, the punishment was that determined by the Biblical adage a ""life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.""41 This meant that anyone found guilty of murder must die according to the law of talion.42 In addition, no ransom could be accepted in order to spare the penalty.43 The only instance where execution might not be mandatory was where the victim was a newborn infant. While the newborn was placed on an equal footing with an adult in terms of its right to life, there were some differences which reflected the view of many other contemporary cultures. The actual status of becoming a true person, or ""nefesh,"" did not occur under Jewish law until thirty days of age. It was therefore generally not considered appropriate to require the death penalty for killing a child under the age of thirty days.44
As a result of this unique respect for human life, infanticide, which was widely practiced in pagan society, was ""simply unknown both as a phenomenon in Jewish history and as a distinct rubric in Jewish law.""45 Many authors of that era remarked on this unusual behavior. Tacitus recorded that the Jews ""regard it as a crime to kill any late-born children.""46 Strabo noted that the Egyptians and the Jews rear every child that is born and that this custom was ""jealously observed.""47 Diodorus of Sicily also distinguished the Egyptians and the Jews from the rest of the Greco-Roman world by their devotion to raising all of their children.48 The Bible would support the notion that Egyptians would raise all children once they were born, for when the Pharaoh had directed the Egyptian midwives, Shiphrah and Puah, to slay all the newborn male Hebrew children, the women returned and explained that they failed because the Hebrew mothers “have their babies so quickly that we can’t get there in time.”49 This implied that while a newborn might possibly be disposed of during the birth process itself, once the baby was witnessed and accepted, it’s removal would be considered an unlawful murder.
That so many contemporaries found it unique that the Jewish people did not practice infanticide did not mean that no individual Jew ever did away with their children. It seems certain, however, that Jewish society, as a whole, did not condone the practice. Jewish writers of the time voiced strict commandments against infanticide as a reflection of this unique characteristic. In the Wisdom of Solomon, the Canaanites were said to be hateful “for their loathsome practices, acts of sorcery and licentious mystery rites; ruthless slayers of their children, and entrail-devouring banqueters of human flesh.”50
Philo, the eminent Jewish philosopher who was born around 20 B.C., was one of the first commentators to speak out clearly against infanticide. Although direct references in the biblical text never specifically mentioned the act of infanticide, Philo interpreted the teachings of Moses as forbidding the practice.51 This seemed reasonable to him ""since the displeasure of the law is not concerned with ages but with a breach of faith to the race,"" and so the prohibition of murder, within the context of the Biblical text, should include all living beings.52 Denouncing the exposure of children as a form of murder, he refused to segregate an infant because of its newly born status.
Josephus, the Jewish historian and contemporary of Philo, also condemned the practice of infanticide. He presumed that Jewish Law required all offspring to be reared, because God had enjoined the Jewish people: “To bring up all our offspring, and forbids women to cause abortion of what is begotten, or to destroy it afterward; and if any woman appears to have so done, she will be a murderer of her child.”53 It would be an anathema because ""she destroys a soul and diminishes the race.""54 Josephus was not critical, however, of the biblical punishment of stoning a child to death if that child was rebellious to his parents.55
Not only were Jews forbidden the killing of children, but the Torah demanded that there was an extra duty for them to have offspring, if capable. The duty of procreation is called the ""first mitzvah"" of the Torah and was based mostly on instructions the Lord gave to Noah and Jacob.56 The chosen people would need to expand their numbers if they were to populate the earth, and this required more than a subtle suggestion. The Talmud directed that ""he who does not engage in procreation is as if he committed murder.""57 The Mishnah agreed that ""a man may not desist from the duty of procreation unless he already has children.""58 The Halakhah, as well, followed the teaching of Hillel in that the obligation was not discharged until the birth of at least one son and one daughter - when the couple ""replaces itself.""59 Maimonides acknowledged that while the mitzvah of ""p'ru ur'vu"" may be fulfilled in this way, the Rabbis advised: ""not to desist from procreation while he yet has strength.""60
Even the spilling of sperm as a means of contraception was not allowed, and such an act was considered equal to homicide since from every seed a person could have been born.61 Sigmund Freud, in explaining a dream to a man where withdrawal during intercourse was used to prevent pregnancy, said: “It gave you reassurance that you had not procreated a child, or, what amounts to the same thing, that you had killed a child.”62
In fact, if a man was to make himself a eunuch ""let such be driven away, as if they had killed their children,"" for they could no longer procure them.63
But despite this extensive encouragement to reproduce, and then raise children without harm, the Old Testament does contain references to infanticide which are allowable under the Law. The frequency of these events have been disputed but James George Frazer believed that the ancient Hebrews sacrificed their first-born children frequently.64 This view was based on a literal translation of the commandment of God given in the book of Exodus: ""The first-born of thy sons shalt thou give unto Me.""65 From this sentence, Frazer implied that the killing of children was a common event, and reflected similar practices in other Semitic races like the Carthaginians, Phoenicians, Canaanites, Moabites, and Sepharvites.66 A passage in Ezekial would tend to support his assertion:
I let them adopt customs and laws which were worthless. Through the keeping of them they could not attain life. In the hope that they would draw back in horror, and know that I alone am God, I let them pollute themselves with the very gifts I gave them. They burnt their firstborn children as offerings to their gods!67
Most modern interpretations, however, do not follow Frazer's view. The majority contend that the consecration to God of the first-born male does not mean an actual sacrifice, but rather a figurative devotional event when it references human beings. The Lord instructed the Jewish people that they may purchase the first-born of the animals back from the Lord but they ""must (italics mine) buy back your firstborn sons.""68 The animals were to be sacrificed but the children redeemed.69 While there are a number of occurrences of sacrificial infanticide which are well documented within the biblical text, they refer to the actions of a specific individual rather than the entire population.
One area of killing which was clearly authorized for all Jews within the text of the Old Testament was the punishment of a ""rebellious child."" Biblical law was very harsh in this regard, and parents were given the authority, and even the directive, to raise their children to follow the teachings of the Lord. This requirement was important ""for the death of the wicked benefits themselves (in that they sin no more) and the world.""70 If a child was not directed towards living a pious life, his evil habits would ultimately lead to sin.
The warnings to follow these precepts were clearly expressed in numerous sections of the Bible:
One who curses his father and his mother - His lamp will go out in the darkness of night.71
Anyone who reviles or curses his mother or father shall surely be put to death;72
Anyone who curses his father or mother shall surely be put to death - for he has cursed his own flesh and blood.73
Anyone who strikes his father or mother shall surely be put to death.74
But despite these clear premonitions, parents could not take the law into their own hands. If they felt that their ""stubborn or rebellious child"" did not obey them, despite being punished, they were directed to:
Take him before the elders of the city and declare, “this son of ours is stubborn and rebellious and won't obey; he is a worthless drunkard.” Then the men of the city shall stone him to death.75
The punishment was intended only for sons and did not allow for execution of daughters. In addition, it was in effect only during the time that the young boy “produces two hairs until he grows a beard right around,"" meaning the hairs of the genitals and not of the face.76 Death would not be an appropriate punishment for the very young, or the mature adult. As might be expected, this aspect of Jewish Law was very controversial and seldom followed.
Other areas of documented infanticide among the early Israelites occurred during famines that were brought on, according to the prophets, as punishment for the sins of the people against the Lord. Forewarnings of such events can be found in many biblical sections. Moses told the people of Israel, before they crossed the Jordan River into the Promised Land, that if they did not obey all the commandments of the Lord, curses would fall upon them: “You will even eat the flesh of your own sons and daughters in the terrible days of siege that lie ahead.”77 And to emphasize this even more Moses continued:
The most tender and delicate woman among you - the one who would not so much as touch her feet to the ground - will refuse to share with her beloved husband, son and daughter. She will hide from them the afterbirth and the new baby she has borne, so that she herself can eat them.78
The warning by Moses is repeated elsewhere, that if the Israelites did not obey, ""you shall eat your own sons and daughters.""79
A similar warning was given by Ezekial, who prophesied in Babylonia around 593 B.C. Because the people had rebelled against the judgments of the Lord, and became more wicked than other nations, the anger of God would be vented and: “Surely parents will eat children in your midst, and children shall eat their parents.”80 Jeremiah, as well, told how the Ben-Hinnom Valley would be no longer called Topheth but ""The Valley of Slaughter"", for “I will see to it that your enemies lay siege to the city until all food is gone, and those trapped inside begin to eat their own children and friends.”81 The Topheth was an area just south of Jerusalem where a cult of child sacrifice was entrenched.82
These forebodings came true, according to the biblical text, during a siege in Samaria by King Ben-hadad of Syria, when the king of Israel was asked by a woman to help with the deadly famine that was killing the people of the town. She proposed that they eat his son one day and her's the next as there was no other source of food. The king agreed and then boiled his son for them to eat.83 The next day he directed her to kill her son, as she had promised, but the woman now refused to follow his command and hid the boy away.84
This brazen act was not often repeated, however, and other mothers allowed their offspring to be eaten as food. During one famine in Jerusalem, the hunger was so great that:
With their own hands the kindly women cooked their children. This was the food they had, when my people was ruined.85
In addition to actions initiated by want of food, there were also numerous recordings of children being killed during sacrificial rites. The most famous of these was a sacrifice begun, but never completed. This was, of course, the willingness of Abraham to offer up his only legitimate son, Isaac, when commanded to do so by the voice of the Lord. This event, which is discussed more thoroughly in the Chapter on Sacrifice, has been the hallmark of faith in the justice of the Almighty God for both Jews and Christians alike. The story is meant to remind all the faithful of the extent to which a pious man must go in his devotion to the wishes of the Almighty God.
But where Abraham was checked by the angel of the Lord before the deadly knife could be thrust into Isaac's body, some Israelites did not abort their sacrificial rites. Ahaz, the king of Judah who ruled for sixteen years in Jerusalem from about 743-727 B.C., was a very wicked leader according to the rabbinic tradition. He did not follow in the ways of king David, but rather made offerings to various deities and idols. He even “passed his son through fire, imitating the abominations of the nations whom YHWH dispossessed before the Israelites.”86
Another Judah king, Manasseh, was also guilty of a similar offense. He reigned from 687-642 B.C., and restored the pagan cults of Baal and Asherah. It is said that: “He made his sons to pass through the fire in the valley of Ben-hinnom, practiced soothsaying, divination, and sorcery, and dealt in necromancy and familiar spirits.”87
Other references to impious actions on the parts of the Israelites, which were threatened to incur the wrath of God, were recorded in various writings by the Prophets. These are covered more extensively in the Chapter on Sacrifice. But one particularly controversial sacrifice concerned Jephthah, a warrior from Gilead appointed by the Israelites to command their army against the Ammonites. Jephthah vowed to the Lord that if He would help him to victory then: “Anything coming out the doors of my house to meet me, when I return with victory from the Ammonites, shall belong to Yahweh; I will offer it up as a burnt offering.”88 Upon his return home, Jephthah expected some animal to appear so he could guarantee his promise, but instead his only child, a daughter, ran out to greet him. When he recognized who it was, he tore his clothes and knew that he had made a vow to the Lord that he could not take back.89 He was forced to give up his daughter's life in order to save his solemn word, for an oath to God superseded even the life of his very own child.
In addition to Old Testament sources, there are references to infanticide in other writings. The Third Book of the Sibylline Oracles is believed to be of Jewish origin, and tells how the people have wandered from the path of the Immortal God. But a warning is put forth to change ""entirely the thought in thy heart,"" and ""thine own offspring rear and do not murder.""90
Although the practice of exposure was much rarer among the Jews than other peoples in antiquity, there were still instances of child abandonment, the most prominent being the voluntary expulsion of Hagar and Ishmael by Abraham, and the forced riverside abandonment of the infant Moses in Egypt. But although the numbers of fabled exposures are small, actual cases must be greater since the Talmud includes children who were abandoned as one of the ten genealogic classes which endured the Babylonian Exile. The Talmud explained that the survivors could be categorized as: priests, levites, Israelites, Halalim, proselytes, freedmen, mamzerim, nethinim, shetuki, and foundlings.91 The foundlings, or Asufi, were those who were gathered from the street ""and knows neither his father nor his mother.""92 The cases were obviously numerous as there is extensive discussion on how to determine whether a child was to be considered legitimate, despite being abandoned. Such a holding, for example, would be made when ""he has been massaged with oil, fully powdered, has beads on him, wears a tablet with an inscription or an amuulet.""93 Although there is little information available on how many children were actually subject to this analysis, most historians believe that the majority of cases were due to economic distress and poverty.
Like other races, Jews were also not immune from actions based on vanity, revenge, or self-survival. The Talmud included a ruling by Mar, son of R. Ashi, that a mother was forbidden from remarriage if her child died because it was possible that she killed it ""so as to be in a position to marry.""94 A story was told that such a case actually occurred where a mother had strangled her child in order to remarry. But the incident was not felt to be proof of the supposition for such a woman would have to be an imbecile as it ""is not likely that sane women would strangle their children.""95 As today, the ancient Hebrews found it inconceivable that infanticide and sanity could exist together in the mind of a Jew.
2. Christianity
Christianity, as a philosophical extension of Judaism embracing the same basic tenets of the Old Testament, held infanticide to be against the teachings of God and Jesus Christ.96 But the early Church Fathers went beyond the limitations of the Talmud and insisted that all human life was inviolable, even the killing of newborns and fetuses. This was truly a new concept for where Judaism retained the definition of ""life"" as being after the birth process, Christianity extended this protection to the fetus within the mother's womb.
Despite this unique humanistic theologic position, early Christians were often accused by the Romans of incredible atrocities, including that of infanticide. The Church was charged with initiating new recruits by covering ""a young baby with flour and then inflict(ing) blows on it and then lick(ing) the blood with thirsty lips.""97 The Romans denounced their claims of innocence and piety as reprehensible lies, and insisted that the Christians were nothing more than a dangerous, malignant sect of renegades.
Today we find such claims little more than a specious smokescreen by an Empire desperately trying to maintain its power base. But similarities to other pagan rites were indeed visible within the sacraments of the Christian Church, and there was much food-for-thought among the Roman censures at the time. The crucifixion of the Son, Jesus Christ, was not only permitted by the Father, but even offered willingly in order to atone for the sins of mankind. Such behavior was not uncommon in many pagan societies, and the ingestion of wafer and wine, representing the body and blood of Christ, evoked images which could support claims of cannibalism.
For the next few centuries, Christian Apologists were busy trying to answer these slanderous accusations to the satisfaction of their new converts. Mostly they pointed to their deep respect of human life to denounce any possible acceptance of infanticidal deeds. Tertullian, in the second century A.D., related in his Apology how the Christians ""are accused of having sworn to murder babies and to eat them.""98 Such a declaration was ridiculous, he argued, for not only is murder forbidden by us, once and for all, but: We are not permitted to destroy even the fetus in the womb.99 The logic, of course, was simple: “No life, not even the very spark of life after conception, could be taken by one who claimed to be a Christian.
In Embassy for the Christians, also written near the end of the second century, Athenogoras argued passionately that the Christians were innocent of the charges brought against them. His reasoning was that:
The same man cannot regard that which a woman carries in her womb as a living creature, and therefore as an object of value to God, and then go about to slay the creature that has come forth to the light of day. The same man cannot forbid the exposure of children, equating such exposure with child murder, and then slay a child that has found one to bring it up.100
Minucius Felix, the third century A.D. African Apologist, replied that the only person capable of believing the stories of Christians draining a baby's blood ""is one who is capable of actually perpetrating it.""101 It was the Romans who knew so much about the atrocities of infanticide because of their obvious guilt, and not the blameless followers of Christ; it was absurd to suggest that Christians could possibly condone the murder of innocent children.
These Apologists could point to a number of sources to back-up their assertions. The prohibition of infanticide was a prominent feature of many early Christian teachings. While much is still in dispute about the origin of some of these works, two of them have almost identical warnings to not commit infanticide. The Didache, or ""Teachings of the Apostles"", written around 60-160 A.D., stated that: “Thou shalt not murder a child by abortion, nor shalt thou kill it when it is born.”102 Although some believe the Didache to be a composite work, rather than that of a single author, it was viewed by many of the early Church Fathers as equivalent to Scripture.103
Another treatise, the Epistle of Barnabas, was thought to be written by the man who was the apostle and companion of St. Paul. It was dated from around 79-130 A.D., and stated an almost identical command as the Didache: “Thou shalt not murder a child by abortion, nor again shalt thou kill it when it is born.”104
This clear commandment against infanticide reappeared under different authorship for many centuries. In the 8th Book of the Apostolic Constitution, which was supposedly handed down from the Apostles by S. Clement, the Bishop of Rome in about 350 A.D., Peter himself was said to have commanded that: Thou shalt not cause abortion, nor after the child is born shalt thou kill it.105 Over and over again, this phrase becomes burnt into the catechism of the new converts.
There were also warnings from the Church Fathers about the dangers of exposure which indicated that the practice was still frequent enough to be of significant concern. Saint Justin Martyr, in the second century A.D., wrote that it was wicked to expose children, both boys and girls, for ""almost all those who are exposed are raised to prostitution.""106 It was only after this cautionary note that Martyr added that a second reason to not expose an infant was that the child could die and the parent would then be guilty of murder.107 Lactantius, who published his works around 302-323 A.D., also maintained that it was as wicked to expose newborns as to kill them.108
Another reason for the emphasis of the Church against exposing a child at birth was the Christian doctrine that children who died without baptism were doomed to eternal perdition.109 The rite of baptism exorcized the stain of original sin, and was the only way a parent could protect their child from suffering for all eternity. But the baptismal rite, in addition to expiating sin, also made the priesthood and the entire social community aware of the infant's birth. If an unmarried mother brought her child to the church for baptism, she thereby publicized the bastard delivery which was forbidden under Christian doctrine. Many women therefore opted to secretly expose the child rather than undergo the resultant castigation.
For many centuries, the punishments ordained for abandoning a child reflected this mandate of baptism. The Council of Mentz in 852 A.D. decreed a harsher penalty for a mother who killed her unbaptized child than for one who killed it after baptism.110 This was seen in many other Middle Age penitentials as well. The problem was not eased until the development of foundling homes which allowed an unmarried woman the ability to bring her child secretly to a location where future care could be provided along with baptismal rites. The Church began to provide some shelter in this regard, in 442 A.D., when the ecclesiastical Councils of Vaison and Arles enjoined the clergy to exhort girls to leave their unwanted infants in niches at the church door rather than expose them in the wild.111 This helped prevent the death of the infant, and the practice eventually led to the development of foundling homes which spread throughout Europe during the Middle Ages. See the Chapter on Exposure for further discussion of this topic.
The rise of Christianity was concomitant with the fall of the Roman Empire, both from a temporal and geographic perspective. The Romans had earlier began to modify the right of a parent to control the life and death of their children, and in 318 A.D., the Emperor Constantine, who had converted to Christianity in 312 A.D., finally declared that the slaying of a child by a father was not protected by the patriae potestas and would be considered a serious crime. By the end of the fourth century A.D., this violation became punishable by death.112
As Christianity became ingrained into the fabric of Roman society, the Christian emperors promulgated further protection for the welfare of their children. Valentinian extended parental responsibilities for the care of offspring in 374 A.D. when he became the first emperor to pronounce that parents must support and rear all the children born to them, and that those who abandoned an infant would be subject to a penalty ""prescribed by law.""113 It would finally be illegal to expose a child under secular law as well as religious and moral teachings.
For families with the ability and means to raise a child, such a warning likely resulted in a lesser chance of infant abandonment. But for others, especially unmarried young women who could not afford to have a newborn child be ascribed to their care, the added risk of legal punishment was not a significant deterrent. If they were discovered, so be it; their plight was pitiful, but understandable.
Once the tide against social acceptance of infanticide was turned, the Church continued to build walls against its resurgence. In 529 A.D., the emperor Justinian ruled that it was not right that those who abandoned their children, ""possibly hoping they would die,"" should retain legal status and be able to later reclaim them.114 Anyone who therefore found an abandoned child could claim it has their own without fear that the biological parent would later have a change of mind.
In 588 A.D., the Council of Constantinople finally compared infanticide directly with homicide.115 After centuries of reprimands and rebukes, the religious ideals of sanctity of life finally began to filter down, in true legal terms, to the newborn infant as well as the adult. Civil and church authorities working together had been able to control the heinous actions of infanticidal parents more than either alone. As the Middle Ages drew near, ambitious plans to eradicate the problem were developed. In 589 A.D., at the Third Council of Toledo in Spain, the clergy asked the civil authorities to enjoin and unite their efforts in order to prevent the crime of infanticide from spreading throughout their land.116 Canon 17 noted that it had been reported that in certain parts of Spain parents were killing their own children, and in order to respond the judges were commanded ""to diligently seek out this horrible crime together with a priest and to forbid it by applied severity.""117 No longer could society, secular or religious, tolerate such impious acts.
But while Christian ethics were clear on how infanticide was to be perceived within the Church itself, there were still mixed signals which an uneducated, and naturally susceptible, populace could find supportive of some of their old habits. The litany of moral dilemmas that the common man faced each day was simply too great to assure that anyone but a saint could follow every one of the commandments. While each devotee might agree with the principal basis for right and wrong, as outlined by the religious writings, it was not as easy to live one's life in absolute acceptance. As John Stuart Mill was later to admit: “It is scarcely too much to say that not one Christian in a thousand guides or tests his individual conduct by reference to those laws.”118 We will see the results of such deviation in the chapters which follow.
C. Islam
In the great trinity of religious beliefs which evolved from the time when Abraham first decided to migrate to the Promised Land, we find that child abandonment, and child sacrifice, played critical roles in the lives of all three progenitors. As Moses, who was exposed soon after birth, survived to become the revered law-giver of the Jews, the progenitor of the Arabs was also exposed by his parents. Where biographical information about the Jewish Patriarchs, or the Christian son of God, Jesus Christ, are built mostly upon faith and writings of uncertain reliability and origin, the life of Mohammed, the founder of Islam, is much more detailed and clear. Written records and historical fact abound, and we can learn from reference, rather than inference, what this remarkable man was like.
Mohammed was born around 570 A.D. in Mecca to the clan of the Banu Hashim. His father, `Abdallah, the son of `Abd-al-Muttalib, died two months before his birth, and his mother, Aminah, died a few years later. Orphaned at a young age, he was raised by his grandfather `Abd-al-Muttalib, and then his uncle Abu Talib.119 At the age of twenty-five years, he married an older, wealthy widow, named Khadija, and spent the next few years working as a successful merchant. He gradually became more intrigued with the doctrines of religion, however, and began to withdraw for long periods of time into the solitude of Mount Hira to contemplate the meaning of Allah - the Omnipotent Lord. One night, during the month of Ramadan in 610 A.D., he had a vision from the angel Gabriel and from then on began to hear, and record, the word of God. His prophecies and writings, collected over the next twenty years, were finally compiled into the Koran (Qur'an) in 652 A.D., and the essence of a new religion, Islam, was formed.
The followers of Mohammed believed in the One God -- Allah -- and in total surrender of their entire life on earth to God's will -- islam -- after which the religion took its name.120 The Koran itself was revered as the words of God in direct revelation, which in the words of the fourteenth century A.D. Arab scholar Ibn Khaldun, ""requires no outside proof"" of its truthfulness.121 It differed from the Torah and the Gospels in that the Prophet Mohammed received it directly in the words and phrases in which it appeared.122 As Ibn Khaldun points out:
God sent our Prophet Mohammad to us, in order to call us to salvation and bliss. He revealed to him His noble book in the clear Arabic language.123
While many of the teachings of Allah were easily accepted, there was one area which hit upon ancient mores of dubious concern. The Persian world, even before the time of Mohammed, was a male-dominated society. Females were generally seen as a burden, and it was not unusual for daughters to be killed at birth.124 Such female infanticide was common all over Arabia during this period of time, and was also prevalent in the Mecca society in which Mohammed grew up.125 These centuries before Mohammed were later to be referred to as the ""Days of Ignorance"" in order to point out how their actions were explainable by the lack of direction from Allah.126
In general, it was only the newborn infant who was killed, but girls were occasionally spared until the age of six years and then sacrificed in a similar fashion.127 The religious precepts of Islam, while finding that the killing of infants was generally wrong, did not alter the lesser status of the female population. As the Koran stated: ""Men are superior to women on account of the qualities with which God hath gifted the one above the other.""128 The Koran, for the first time, introduced reforms that included the prohibition of female infanticide.129 Mohammed outlined this problem in various sections of the Holy book.130 How will you answer, he asked, ""when the female child that had been buried alive shall be asked for what crime she was put to death.""131 While daughters may indeed be less favored under the eyes of Allah, it was not permissible to take away their lives simply because one desired a son. He reproached the people for their reactions to a daughter's birth:
And they ascribe daughters unto God! Glory be to Him! But they desire them not for themselves. For when the birth of a daughter is announced to any one of them, dark shadows settle on his face and he is sad. He hideth him from the people because of the ill tidings: shall he keep it with disgrace or bury it in the dust? Are not their judgments wrong?132
He also admonished fathers for wanting sons rather than daughters:
What! hath your Lord prepared sons for you, and taken for himself daughters from among the angels?133
God's the kingdom of the Heavens and of the Earth! He createth what He will! and he giveth daughters to whom He will, and sons to whom He will.134
One does not question God, one follows the law and gives thanks for any blessed receipts. There were additional warnings to not commit infanticide because of financial despair: “And do not kill your children for fear of poverty; We give them sustenance and yourselves (too); surely to kill them is a great wrong.”135
Avner Giladi noted that prohibition of infanticide was not only a feature of the Koran, but was also a prominent component of the Hadith literature which was created in the first century of Islam.136 Muslims, like their biblical cousins the Christians and Jews, totally rejected the killing of infant children.
Islam thereby provided an obvious theologic direction to prohibit the practice of infanticide among its converts, but did not change one of the underlying reasons for its utilization - the subservient nature of women when compared to men. As long as sons were more highly desired than daughters, the problem of female infanticide would remain.
D. Hinduism
This chapter would not be complete without at least some reference to one of the most popular religions of the world: Hinduism. Hinduism is not an offshoot of the biblical Patriarch, Abraham, but its origins date back to between 1500-1200 B.C. when the sacred ten books of the Vedas were said to have been written. Buddha, or Gautama Siddhartha, a deified religious leader from Asia, was thought to have been born around 563 B.C., and his followers formed the mystical faith of Buddhism. Together, these two beliefs provided the spiritual theology for millions of people in India and throughout the world.
As was evident in many of the creation myths of other ancient peoples, sacrifice played a role in the creation of mankind within this religion as well. In the ""The Hymn of Man,"" from the Rigveda, the story was told of Purusha, who had a thousand heads, eyes and feet, and ""is all that yet hath been and all that is to be.""137 The Sadhyas and Rishis gods sacrificed Purusha as an offering to create all the creatures of the air, and animals of the land. And from that great sacrifice came the castes of men which included the Brahaman priests from his mouth, the Rajanya kings from his arms, the Vaisya traders from his thighs, and the Sudra laborers from his feet.138
Out of this saga of life and death also developed the Hindu belief in reincarnation and the rebirth of man through a series of repetitive lives. While the body itself might pass through the degradation of death, the Hindus believed that the soul would live eternally. In the ""Conquest of Death,"" in the Katha Upanishad, it was explained that:
The Knowing Self is not born, it dies not; it sprang from nothing, nothing sprang from it. The Ancient is unborn, eternal, everlasting; he is not killed, though the body is killed.139
A human being therefore need not fear death for ""a mortal ripens like corn, like corn he springs up again.""140 Believers were willing to sacrifice all they possessed in order to achieve heavenly reward and eternal peace. Vajasravasa, for example, gave up the life of his only son, Nachiketas, in order to achieve this glorious end, and then, in respect to the loss of the child, named the fire sacrifice rite after the boy.141
What might appear to others as an act of callousness, this readiness to sacrifice one's own child, was, in reality, a pious show of devotion, similar to that revealed in the tale of Abraham and Isaac. The Bhagavad-Gita, or ""Blessed Lord's Song,"" explained that:
As man casts off worn-out garments and puts on others which are new, similarly the embodied soul, casting out worn-out bodies, enters into others which are new.142
The spirit of man lives on: ""It is eternal, all-pervading, unchangeable, immovable, everlasting.""143 Under such a belief it was not necessary to mourn the loss of another person: “For that which is born death is certain, and for the dead birth is certain. Therefore grieve not over that which is unavoidable.”144
In part, because of this religious belief, and partly because of the many social pressures that preferred the birth of a son to a daughter as well, the history of India was filled with evidence of widespread female infanticide as is discussed in the chapter on Female Infanticide.

Author’s Note
Dear Reader,
Like my protagonist, Jacob Casell, I never developed an affinity for Math or Science. Please take the Science in this book with a grain of salt. It’s in there for the fun of it.
CHAPTER ONE
Rhoanna
I HAVE NEVER wanted to live an ordinary life. As far back as I can remember, I’ve camped out in my imagination. When it came time to earn a living, I suffered through a succession of regular jobs until I managed to support myself by writing mystery novels. Inevitably, though, the thing we call “Reality” finds a way to humble the dreams and intentions of almost any man or woman, even if they are living and breathing the existence they aspired to.
This maxim applied to me until I stumbled across a silver sphere at the ocean’s edge one lonely night on Daytona Beach while I contemplated the ending of my latest novel. The occupant of the silver sphere has since taken me on adventures that my imagination could have never conceived. As a matter of fact, my lovely wife and I are currently on one of those adventures. It is a critical and highly classified mission.
A casual observer might say that the scope of my narrow existence has expanded exponentially since meeting my AI friend from the other side of the Milky Way. I would agree.
• • •
We are two hundred and ninety miles above Jupiter’s equator at the apex of our elliptical orbit. From this vantage point, the entire planet is visible through our apertures.
As a quarter of the gaseous giant fills our forward-viewing screen, NASA Liason Officer Rhoanna Kensington remarks, “There she is, Mister and Missus Casell, the third stop on our solar tour. Isn’t she beautiful?”
I must admit that Jupiter, with its swirling, multi-colored gas clouds, is truly a sight to behold.
However, Rhoanna’s comment is old news to my lovely wife, Amy, myself, and our stalwart AI companion, Arcon. I suppose the announcement makes Rhoanna feel useful. In her position as a NASA Liaison Officer, she has little to do besides taking notes on our performance. I’m sure her duties as a NASA Liaison Officer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory are varied and valuable. Rhoanna may even view her function here as beneath her since she has a law degree and is qualified to fly fighter jets, not to mention elevating herself to the rank of Astronaut. But we regard her presence as nothing more than a fifth wheel.
You would think that saving the Earth and its inhabitants a couple of times would qualify us to safely ferry a cadre of world leaders around the solar system to bang some sense into their heads. Of course, that’s not good enough. A formal evaluation and subsequent report are required.
As I often tell myself, Such is life.
Turning to Rhoanna in the seat behind me, I ask her for what seems like the hundredth time, “Can you please call Amy and me by our first names? Your formality makes us uncomfortable.”
Even the most thrilling adventures have their mundane moments, I reflect.
“I’d like to be called by my first name, too,” says our third-string pilot, Captain Dustin L. Fillmore, from his second-row seat behind Amy. NASA officials have warned me never to use Dustin’s middle name because it is “Lesley.”
Captain Fillmore is twenty years old and going on forty. Dustin thinks he knows everything in the observable universe. He overcompensates because he never found his place in adolescent society, thanks to cruel peers who belittled him for his height and unusually high intelligence. NASA plucked Dustin out of this hell when they recruited him for a unique test program designed for genius types. Since test pilots and astronauts require extensive training, not to mention a rare set of personality traits, NASA figured they would try to develop candidates from an early age to capitalize on their investment by extending an astronaut’s career. Dustin Fillmore fit NASA’s specifications, and he did not disappoint. With an off-the-charts performance in flight training, NASA decided to give Dustin the honorary title of Captain and a chance to fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a deep space pilot and engineer. Despite being a pain in the ass, Dustin manages to earn his consumables.
To his credit, Captain Fillmore is an extraordinary individual, a prerequisite for astronaut candidacy. The man has a remarkable will. He once told me he stood 5’ 5” tall at the age of twelve. His father is over six feet tall. His mother, Andrea, stands at 5’ 1”. Dustin’s three older siblings are tall, which left the strong possibility of him inheriting the recessive short gene from his mother, according to Mendel’s experiments with pea plants. Dustin willed himself to grow to 5' 10"" by the age of eighteen. He didn’t want to risk growing any taller because 6’ astronauts are few and far between.  
I often go off into thoughts like these--a habit I’m trying to curb. Concentration is key when piloting an alien ship in outer space. I crash back to what we call reality when something unusual grabs my attention. Instead of Rhoanna’s usual response to my request for less formality and a more robust team-building approach, I notice her brown eyes widening. Turning back to the forward aperture for a live look, I see four large ships materialize at Jupiter’s four geographic poles. I turn to my lovely wife and co-pilot, Amy Goodwin Casell, to be sure that I’m not hallucinating. She confirms the sighting. No one, including Arcon, can identify the markings on the ships.
Our Starship, the Dauntless, has been retrofitted for this mission. Due to the safety features added for our precious future passengers, the ship is no longer the deadly beast it once was when under attack.
With an unwieldy pair of UV-treated eyeglasses, Amy observes the main screen from her front-row seat. She isn’t wearing contact lenses today because her eyes need a rest from studying celestial charts and jotting down her direct observations of deep space phenomena as seen through the ship’s powerful telescope.
I answer Amy’s question before she asks it. Great minds think alike, especially when they’ve been through the pulse-pounding adventures we’ve taken with Arcon and an Aneleyan scientist named Silenna.
“I make the ships out to be freighters.”
Amy swings her adorable, freckled face in my direction. “How can you tell?”
“Judging by size and shape, they aren’t battle cruisers, invasion force carriers, or fighters.”
It is time to ask the fountain of information known as Arcon to share his thoughts on the appearance of the mystery freighters. I can avoid wasting energy on words because Arcon can read a question formulated in my mind before I ask it.
By concentrating his ultra-powerful mind on anything in deep space, in this case one of the freighters, Arcon can hear sounds up to a thousand miles away.
Ensconced in his silver sphere outer covering, Arcon floats to the central observation aperture for a closer look. “Give me a few minutes to translate the language the aliens are using to communicate ship-to-ship. Their language is very unusual.”
Before Arcon can regale us with his insights and deductions, I notice cylindrical tubes descending from the bellies of each freighter. The tubes elongate and disappear into Jupiter’s roiling atmosphere.
While I’m wondering what the hell is going on, Arcon speaks. He can communicate with us telepathically, but he chooses the verbal route because telepathy unnerves Rhoanna and Dustin. We’ve learned they are both very private people.
“It will take more time to be sure, but if I have to guess, which I believe is necessary, I’d say the freighters are here to siphon gases from Jupiter’s cloud atmosphere.”
“Something tells me,” Amy says, turning around to Arcon, “that you have a pressing reason to guess because you hate guessing.”
“I don’t ‘hate’ guessing, Amy. I dislike it. Guessing comes in handy in emergencies, which is precisely our present state of affairs. If the freighters reduce Jupiter’s mass, the planet’s Gravity will increase. The concept is counterintuitive, but it is a proven theory. From what I see and according to my calculations, we must abort our Jupiter orbit immediately before the planet crushes us with its increasing pull.”
The Dauntless slides sideways as if it were piloting itself. Above the churning clouds, the freighters retract their tubes and then dematerialize, having filled their bellies, I suppose.
CHAPTER TWO
Jacob
I CAN SEE the curve of Jupiter’s right quadrant through the oblong porthole on my side of the cockpit. Almost imperceptively, Jupiter is deflating like a giant beachball with a pinhole puncture. Arcon’s calculations confirm what I’m seeing.
The controls are sticky. Amy and I struggle to position the Dauntless to blast us out of orbit. The more we try, the worse it gets.
“Let’s not worry about our course,” I finally tell Amy.
“Agreed. “Let’s fire the engines and lose this place.”
“Helmets,” I call to the ship’s main computer, which I’ve named Nathan. On our last mission, I felt it was high time to call the computer something besides “computer.” Like all advanced AI systems I’ve dealt with, Nathan has developed a unique personality over time. He deserves a name.
Our helmets descend from compartments within the bridge’s ceiling.
“Seat belts,” I tell Nathan.
Our safety restraints automatically tighten.
After a brief countdown, I flip a series of switches to prepare for engine ignition. Then, I push a single button to fire the aft engines.
The sudden thrust pushes us back into our seats, which are custom-fitted for our unique bodies. Still, the rapid acceleration is uncomfortable.
“Jupiter’s Gravity is increasing faster than our rate of acceleration,” Arcon reports. “The freighters caused Jupiter’s outer cloud layer to drift into space.”
I glance out of my side aperture. Jupiter’s departing cloud layer is forming a ring around the dwindling planet. We are losing altitude. Soon, the swirling gas clouds below our Starship will devour us. The centrifugal force within the clouds will tear the Dauntless apart, and we’ll disappear into eternity, never to be heard from again.
Checking my instrument panel, I see that the hull pressure is rising. Our orbital escape window is closing. I’m out of my depth here. Without turning, I say into my helmet intercom, “Dustin, do you know how to over-clock a Starcraft engine?”
“I’ll figure it out,” he answers confidently.
“Good. Get down to the engine control room. Arcon, go with him.”
“I wasn’t going to let him go down there by himself,” Arcon answers irritably.
My constant AI associate is in one of his moods. I can’t blame him. He has plenty of reasons to be.
Like Rhoanna, Dustin has yet to adjust to telepathic communication. Therefore, Arcon must accompany him to the engine suite. One genius and one super-genius thrown together will improve our chances immeasurably, assuming they don’t squabble.
As I listen to the sound of the elevator descending to the lower deck, I feel helpless, exposed, and embarrassed. I’ve pushed the engines to maximum thrust. There is nothing else I can do except to keep the ship steady and monitor the disturbing readings of my instruments.
Maybe I can keep the crew up here calm while we await our fate.
“Now that we have a moment, Rhoanna, why don’t you tell me what it’s like to be married to an English Baron?”
“This is an inappropriate time for small talk, Mister Casell.”
“Wouldn’t you say it beats thinking about what may happen to us in the next five or ten minutes?”
Out of the corner of my eye, I catch Amy shaking her head, or should I say her helmet?
“Alright. If you must know, I’ve taken to the life of a Baroness, although I can’t do everything expected of me in my royal role, thanks to my position with NASA.”
“What is the most difficult part of being a Baroness?”
“Loretta, my husband Calvin’s mother. She almost had a stroke when she found out I was bi-racial.”
Arcon’s voice bursts into my head before I can formulate a response to Rhoanna.
“The engines are over-clocked.”
“That was quick,” I tell Arcon through my helmet com.
“Who cares? Just get us out of here.”
On my virtual keypad, I enter the code that releases the default engine settings.
“Nathan, maximum speed. Now!”
“It is unsafe to exceed default settings,” Nathan replies.
“Just do it. Now!”
“It’s your funeral.”
“Don’t be a smartass.”
I feel the Dauntless shake before I am flattened into my seat again. The extra G force prevents me from reaching my control panel.
“Nathan, calculate the optimum angle for orbital exit. Assume control of the ship.”
“Please advise course coordinates.”
I glance at the hull pressure gauge. It indicates the hull integrity is in the danger zone.
“There is no course heading. Just get us out of Jupiter’s Gravitational field.”
“Very well.”
I reach across to take Amy’s gloved hand.  “I want to say, maybe for the last time, that I love you dearly.”
Amy winks at me through her faceplate. “Don’t be dramatic, darling. We’ll survive. It’s what we do.”
Turning back to our expansive forward window, which I like to call the “windshield,” I see a blue blur smashing against it. I am treated to this sight only because, in the confusion, I forgot to bring the aperture shields down.
“Auto-aperture shield closure,” Nathan announces.
Thank God. Then I remember the shields close slower at hypersonic speeds.
I glance sideways just in time to watch a jagged line creep across the outer layer of my left side aperture. It looks like ice cracking on a frozen lake.
The last thing I remember before passing out is hearing the outer hull groan.
CHAPTER THREE
Amy
I AM HAVING dinner with my parents at their Manhattan apartment on a Friday night Sabbath. My father has asked me to say a blessing while holding a chunk of Challah.
“Baruch ata Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, hamotzi lechem min ha’aretz. Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who has brought forth bread from the Earth.”
I eat a piece of Challah and pass it to my mother while my father recites the blessing over the wine. After we take a sip from our silver chalices, we are ready to get down to the business of eating the Sabbath meal. The star of tonight’s supper is pot roast. Potato pancakes and green beans play supporting roles. My mother made my favorite Sabbath dinner for me as a going-away gift. Next week, I will enter my first year of college. Much to my parents’ dismay, I have chosen to attend college in California rather than the Eastern schools that accepted me. I am going to UCLA because it has the best writing program.
As my father cuts thick slices of pot roast to serve us, he uses the occasion to ask me, “Jacob, do you really think you can earn a decent living writing books?”
“I can always teach English to supplement my income,” I answer to ease my father’s concern while telling myself it will never come to that.
My mother looks at me as if she will never see me again.
“Mom. You know I’ll come home to see you and Dad every chance I get. There are the Jewish holidays and intersessions, and I’ll probably need a few long weekends to keep my weight up and stress level down. You aren’t losing me.”
“You say that now,” my mother says, “but. . .”
Someone is shaking me, not very gently. The dream fades.
“Jacob! Wake up!
My eyes flutter open. The first thing I see is a robot arm hanging from the ceiling. I know it would not be hanging there unless it had recently done something to me.
At 5’ 11” inches, my wife towers over me in all her lithe glory. Arcon floats over her left shoulder, inhabiting the silver sphere that contains his immense energy. The sphere allows a trickle of Arcon’s energy transmission to reach the outside world, benefitting everything it touches. I’ve witnessed Arcon’s evolution since we first met. Along with other changes, Arcon’s internal energy has slowly and steadily multiplied. He must now constantly regulate his transmission because it would otherwise burn Human skin.
With great trepidation, I wiggle my toes. They work, thank God. Next, I try to move my legs and arms. Looking down at my chest and the rest of my body, I see that I’m wearing a blue surgical gown, and leather cuffs restrain my ankles and wrists. I rotate my cuffed feet and hands. I can move my extremities. This is encouraging, but I won’t know if my entire body still works until I try to sit up. At this point, Amy takes my hand in both of hers.
“How do you feel, darling?”
“Ask me when I finish taking inventory of my anatomy.”
Amy giggles. My response tells her that my brain is still intact. I notice the heart monitor and vitals tracker standing on tripods to my right. They work wirelessly. Arcon invented the wireless connection. He could make billions from it if he cared a squat about money.
“You had me scared, Jacob. Your vitals and heart rate returned to normal half an hour after we rushed you into the Med Bay, but you’ve been out for hours.”
“Maybe I needed the sleep.”
“That’s not funny. The robot arm gave you a stimulant injection. It didn’t work. We thought you were in a coma until I shook you awake.”
“Your touch is always invigorating, among other things. What happened?”
“You passed out. The over-clocked engines gave us just enough power to break out of Jupiter’s Gravity. Once we escaped Jupiter’s pull, the ship careened haphazardly into deep space, almost at lightspeed. Dustin and I barely managed to regain control of the ship.”
“Did you black out?”
“Momentarily. The G-force must have hit you harder.”
“Well, I’m glad everything worked out. Now, I’d like to get off this table. Can someone please remove my restraints?”
“We must keep you under observation for a while,” Arcon intones. “Any sudden movements might have serious consequences.”
“Are you sure you aren’t torturing me for staying up beyond my prescribed bedtime?”
“I’m taking precautions, Jacob, because you failed to train hard enough for the mission. Your body couldn’t handle the adverse conditions caused by the Gravity overload. You faded while everybody else made it through.”
“I didn’t have time to train harder. My new manuscript is overdue. My agent is threatening to disown me.”
“That’s no excuse. You endangered the mission and everyone aboard.”
Amy intercedes. “Okay, that’s enough, Arcon. Jacob needs to rest.”
“I did not endanger the mission,” I protest.

Finn held the grinder with both hands, applying a light but steady pressure. A river of sparks bounced off his glasses and cascaded down his overalls. The cutting-disc spun fast and created a circle of orange light and river of fire. The factory warehouse manufactured machine parts for the cyborg-police Hydra.
Although Finn’s tasks were quite basic. The factory warehouse was two levels, a ground floor for basic mechanical production, the higher level for more skilled production aspects, as well as management. The floor was a grate of interlocking circles providing a textured anti-slip. The tall pillars were bare steel, they supported a blue sheet metal roof. Finn took off his glasses and gloves, stacked them away in the box along with his grinder and saws and files. He looked up at the clock and smiled with a luxurious sigh.
He walked past other workers who ventured no greeting and avoided eye contact. In the bathroom he scrubbed the black-metal stains off his hands with plenty of soap and a small stiff brush. Looking in the mirror he brushed his hair back and put on and zipped up his waterproof and thickly lined jacket. It would be cold tonight.
His breath was misty. His fingers, toes and ears stung with the frosty night air. Finn boarded the shuttle-train on his way home. The shuttle-train was white and cream and sleek with round windows. The train was electric and very quiet. Finn looked out at the City of Twilight. The factory was now a blue metal box receding behind him with the industrial zone of the city. Ahead to the right now were tall apartment buildings that arched with their steep roofs. The rain splashed down the blue and green roof-tiles and pelted the balconies and windows. Ahead to the left were the city gardens, dark in places, sparkling in places with lights and water features. There was a museum in the centre of the city gardens.
Finn relaxed back into the scarlet red soft couches and watched the beads of rain streak across the windows of the electric train. Above the City of Twilight there was a hundred-metre wall. This was known as the Forcewall, its purpose being to divide the territories of two different city states owned by the two different Machinegods; the Monarchy of the Blue Horse (which owned Finn’s city) and the Syndicate of the Red Trident.
The Forcewall was a strange thing, it could appear like a sheet of ice, a wall of mercury, a hologram buzzing with light and electricity. Its technical aspects were a mystery to most, yet it ringed the City of Twilight in its icy silvery glow ̶  keeping everyone in their proper place. Feeling sleepy, he closed his eyes and sunk his head back onto the soft red couch, time and place became a blur of forgetfulness ̶   there was only the speed of the shuttle train, as he sloshed around like vodka in a glass bottle ̶   as he drifted halfway between sleep and wakefulness.
Luckily, Finn opened his eyes just as his stop loomed into view. He walked down the shuttle train centre aisle, grabbing the poles for support as he did so. He stepped off into the cold night air. The Forcewall around the City of Twilight hid some of the sky but most of the stars were still visible. He went down the street, down the stairs and through his front door. Finn’s home was small, a kitchen, lounge/study and cream coloured window shutters. A few photographs of better days, a few old books read over many times, and a few paintings. After a meal of spaghetti bolognaise and a glass of red wine, he realised he had almost forgotten to take his daily medication! He held the black pill in his hand as he looked at it with a reluctant grimace; the liquorice capsule filled with the chemical comfort of a flat line of resignation. He put the black pill in his mouth, drank some water and swallowed.
The following morning, the factory labourer was again riding the shuttle train, this time returning back to the industrial zone. There were two other passengers, (most of the seats were empty) a woman who fluttered bird-like to the very back of the carriage; and a man who lumbered beetle-like to the very front and plonked himself down. Finn watched as the tall apartment blocks, the city gardens and museum passed in and out of vision. They sped closer to the industrial zone.
As he was looking at the Forcewall, there was a glitch, an error, a small hole opened in the massive wall, and he could see into the neighbouring city beyond... He saw streets filled with red and black cars and square soviet style brutalist buildings. He saw the symbol of Red Trident the Machinegod. He saw a neon screen in the city centre playing a film; it was Ellie Doe Vanessa the movie star and cyber-Aphrodite of course, she was standing at the top of a staircase looking down, she looked nervous, even afraid, her dress cascaded down onto the floor like flower petals. Then the error resolved itself and the portal in the Forcewall closed over. And he could only see the impenetrable massive sheet of ice pulsing with electricity, the expanse of shimmering mercury. The factory labourer looked around excitedly at the other passengers ̶  but they hadn’t noticed anything…
Something was wrong with him today, he knew it, his employers knew it, his workmate Max knew it. The image of the movie star was glowing in his mind. He cut himself; it bled a little.
‘Damn it!’
‘You right mate? What’s wrong with you today, Valax?’
The labourer bandaged up his hand, then turned back to his work mate.
‘Are you really content here Max? I mean what are we even doing here?’
Max’s face creased into an expression of confusion, mildly irritated.
‘We manufacture parts for Hydra the cyborg-police. We manufacture parts for the Machinegod. We keep the city functional and the economy running. This is our assigned profession, and the Blue Horse knows best.’

PREFACE
I’m not afraid of storms, for I’m learning how to sail my ship.
— LOUISA MAY ALCOTT, LITTLE WOMEN
Stoic Empathy might seem like a paradox—combining the rigidity of stoicism with the compassion of empathy. However, through my experiences and research, I’ve discovered that they’re not opposing forces but symbiotic companions on the journey of self-discovery and influence. From childhood oppression and war to teenage bullying and climbing the corporate ladder, I’ve unearthed the profound synergy between stoicism and empathy. These aren’t mere concepts to understand intellectually but guiding principles that, when embraced fully, become the bedrock of personal empowerment and societal change.
With this book, I serve as your navigator through the confluence of ancient Stoic wisdom and empathic connection, presenting a structured process that increases your power while deepening your relationships. With each chapter, I hope you’ll not only be informed but also transformed as you explore the nuances of empathy, the discipline of stoicism, and the application of these timeless concepts in the modern world. As you progress along the path of Stoic Empathy, the book will draw on personal stories, influential figures and events, and expert research to explore its complex beauty. My goal is to provide you with a practical road map for navigating life’s challenges with grace, resilience, and compassion while effecting meaningful change in the world.
The first chapter explores the nuanced interplay between external forces that shape our lives and the personal power we possess to navigate and influence these dynamics. It sets out the benefits of Stoic Empathy, which combines the fortitude and inner control espoused by Stoic philosophy with the deep understanding fostered by empathy to offer a transformative framework for wielding influence. Chapters 2 through 4 detangle the concept of empathy, and then 5 through 8 dig deep into stoicism.
Specifically, Chapters 2, 3, and 4 elaborate on the two primary types of empathy, Cognitive and Emotional, and set the foundation for their practical application through what I call strategic empathy. Together, these chapters draw out five essential tools to advance our empathic skills, including Affect Labeling, Silence, Active Listening, Mirroring and Repeating, and Probing Questions, to facilitate a deeper connection and trust between people, enhance rapport, and provide pathways to insights and clarity. Going far beyond trendy euphemisms, these chapters lay out scientific grounding behind the tools, provide techniques for empathetic engagement, and create a comprehensive framework for understanding and connecting with others in a more meaningful and empathic manner.
Chapters 5, 6, 7, and 8 shift focus to the principles of stoicism, grounding ancient wisdom in contemporary understanding and practical application. Together, these chapters update Greco-Roman philosophy to fit the modern era, highlight neuroscience breakthroughs that corroborate ancient teachings, distinguish emotional regulation from emotional denial (controlling our emotions isn’t repressing them), and outline multiple emotional regulation exercises to unravel the mechanisms behind our ability to consciously manage our emotions. Significantly, just as the strategic empathy chapters earlier in the book present five empathy tools, the stoicism chapters in this part of the book set out five concrete methods of stoic self-regulation (updated with modern methodologies) to help you discern what is and is not in your control, modulate your emotions whenever possible, and act ethically at all times. These five techniques are Dichotomy of Control, Discomfort Embracing, Habituation, Memento Mori, and Moral Courage. Together, these chapters on stoicism equip you with the means to foster resilience, shape your character through consistent practice, and underscore the importance of living ethically and embracing life’s impermanence, which can profoundly affect empathetic interactions.
Once we’ve explored the collaborative capabilities of stoicism and empathy, the last portion of the book shows how deliberately and purposefully employing Stoic Empathy equips us to navigate the complex dance of geopolitical issues with both compassion and strategic insight, enabling us to gain power while remaining true to our own ethics and values. With our newfound powers of persuasion and self-control, we must also embrace the duty to wield that power responsibly.
This book is more than a guide—it’s an invitation to transform. It equips you with the knowledge to navigate life’s complexities through an empathic lens enhanced by stoic clarity. By blending rigorous scientific research with philosophical depth, it challenges you to apply ancient principles in ways that are both strategically effective and profoundly ethical. As you move toward the concluding chapters, prepare to be empowered by a synthesis of stoic and empathetic mastery, ready to face the world with resilience, understanding, and virtue. Here you’ll find actions, philosophies, tools, and stories to ethically influence and shape your environment and yourself, fostering a world where power is exercised wisely and with a deep awareness of its far-reaching implications.
Welcome to the journey.
CHAPTER 1
MY LIFE, POWER, AND APPLYING STOIC EMPATHY
The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don’t have any.
— ALICE WALKER
I remember the evening vividly, like a painting come to life in my mind—vibrant, poignant, and bursting with energy. Our home in Iran buzzed with the excitement of the night’s gathering. For me at 11 years old, these events offered a glimpse into a captivating yet mystifying world. The air was rich with the scents of cardamom and saffron, and sad songs softly colored the background as my mother danced through her cooking. Soon, the music shifted to livelier tunes as guests began arriving, each bringing stories of daily struggles. The living room, filled with relatives and friends, echoed with laughter and the murmur of deep conversations, while children darted in and out with games of hide-and-seek. As the night grew, so did the energy, transforming our space into a display of resilience underscored by the forbidden voices of Iranian exiles and Western rock—each melody a whisper of hope amid adversity. The very air we breathed was alive with our spirit. At the center of it all was Lily, who danced with a grace that seemed untouched by the years of political upheaval that had scarred our homeland. Unlike the other, more traditional aunts, Lily insisted we call her by her first name alone, discarding the “aunt” title and its aging formality. Her dance was more than an art—it was an act of resistance and self-preservation.
Lily’s movements were fluid, each gesture weaving a narrative of resilience and quiet rebellion. With every step and turn, she seemed to cast off the world’s burdens, embodying a profound Stoic Empathy. Here was a woman who had endured the betrayal of a revolution yet found strength, not in the overt displays of defiance, but in the subtlety of her dance. She showed us that true fortitude lies in maintaining one’s essence in the face of misfortune, a lesson in emotional control and understanding deeply aligned with the principles of Stoicism.
Her dance reflected the stoic acceptance of her reality—acknowledging the pain but not being overcome by it—paired with a profound empathy, seen in the way her performance resonated with all who watched, mirroring their collective sorrow and optimism. This was Stoic Empathy in motion: the balance of enduring strength and visceral connection, setting the stage for us to explore how these forces aren’t just compatible but synergistic.
Beneath the veneer of festivity and brightness of hope, though, there lay a palpable tension. As the music faded and conversations about politics and war filled the room, I was left to ponder the juxtaposition of our external chaos against the lively spirit that danced through our gatherings. Though I didn’t always understand, I could listen and experience the fear, hope, and stoic acceptance of the turmoil that enveloped our country. As the evening waned and guests departed, I lay in bed, the echoes of laughter and somber conversations replaying in my mind. I closed my eyes and allowed Lily’s silent protests against the chains that sought to bind her spirit, a powerful lesson in navigating life’s complexities with both stoic wisdom and empathetic grace, lull me to sleep.
From my early childhood, it was stoicism, with its aspects of emotional regulation, and empathy, with its awareness of others, that got me through a time marked by revolution and war. It was 1979 and I was only two years old (my twin sisters were recently born) when Iran underwent a seismic shift in governance and culture. Revolution, transformation, and turmoil defined us as we transitioned into an Islamic theocracy that redefined the fabric of our society. These years were further complicated by the outbreak of a devastating conflict with Iraq, a war that spanned a decade and etched the realities of fear, loss, and resilience deep into my psyche. In Tehran, where we lived, the war wasn’t a distant concept relayed through news reports; it was our lived reality. Missile attacks shattered our tranquility in civilian areas, and the threat of violence loomed large, forcing us into bomb shelters and away from the normalcy of school and childhood play. My education during these formative years unfolded in the shadow of conflict, with state-sponsored math and reading programs on TV replacing traditional schooling and with the scarcity of essentials defining our daily lives.
But my real education was watching the adults around me, particularly my parents. During this tumultuous period, the conditions of our existence forced them to inhabit dual realities—a bifurcation of self that was as much a survival strategy as it was a silent rebellion. Outwardly, they presented a facade meticulously crafted to align with the expectations of the morality police, who enforced strict Islamic codes of behavior and dress through intimidation and public punishment, and the conservative ethos that now enveloped our everyday interactions. This external persona was a carefully orchestrated performance designed to navigate the scrutinizing gaze of a society keen on uniformity and adherence to its newly imposed norms. Survival required malleability to every situation, which meant awareness of who was around us at any time, what they were thinking, what they were feeling, and how they would respond to what we did—and, in turn, it required us to control our emotional experiences and expressions in response to the empathic read.
I exercised what I saw. The space for intellectual exploration within the confines of our home helped with my practice. There were always books around, constant poetry games, art in every meal, and best of all, heated debate about everything from politics to religions. This internal life was a testament to the human spirit’s resilience, an assertion of identity in the face of systemic erasure. Navigating these divergent worlds from a tender age instilled in me an acute sense of awareness and adaptability. I learned not just to read a room but to embody its expectations, discerning the values and morals of those around me. This skill was constantly accompanied by my parents’ ideals of equality, their faith in me that I could be anything the world around me allowed, and their refusal to ever resort to brutality, injustice, and exploitation. I watched as my mother seemingly controlled the very streets upon which she walked, while extending a helping hand to whoever needed it. I watched as my father practiced daily Transcendental Meditation, reciting a mantra a monk gave him when he was a teenager (a mantra he hasn’t revealed to the family to this day). We maneuvered our way around the government and legal systems to get us permission to exit the country at a time when no other country would take an Iranian, without ever selling out a friend or taking advantage of a colleague to get what we wanted.
These teachings became my compass, allowing me to maneuver through the intricate labyrinths of social interactions and the challenges they presented. It was a dance of conformity and resistance played out on Tehran’s shifting sands, where survival hinged on the ability to be a chameleon amid the stark black-and-white contrasts of our reality.
Stoic Empathy, in essence, is the delicate balance of strength and sensitivity, resilience and understanding. It’s the quiet resolve to confront life’s adversities with unwavering fortitude, coupled with strategic empathy that serves us as well as others. Through this synthesis, I’ve not only found solace and serenity within myself but also unlocked the potential to effect meaningful change in the world around me. With the union of stoicism and empathy, anyone can transcend the confines of our individual existence, contribute to the collective tapestry of human experience, and forge a more compassionate, resilient, and harmonious world—a world that honors the inherent dignity and worth of every person and sows the seeds of positive transformation.
A Power Approach to Life: Navigating Complex Power Dynamics with Stoic Empathy
As I reflect on my life, I recognize that the journey to embracing Stoic Empathy has been ongoing, a continuous evolution marked by moments of clarity and revelation. It’s shaped my worldview, informed my advocacy, and imbued my words with a resonance born from lived experience.
The first of these insights is that, as I write these paragraphs today, I gratefully do so with the rather remarkable comfort to say and write as I wish without reprisal from the government. Yet, a sense of complete freedom eludes me. Others, you see, intrude upon my power.
I sometimes come across assertions like: “the only power others have over you is the power you give them” or “our reality is ours to manifest” or “nothing is beyond our control.” They’re frequently cited in various contexts, especially in discussions focusing on personal empowerment and self-determination. Reflecting on my childhood juxtaposed against my current life, one might argue these sayings find validation. Yet, these overly simplistic notions, rampant in self-help and motivational realms, aren’t merely misleading but inherently dangerous. My childhood taught me (and adulthood confirmed) that every society is full of power dynamics that exist external to our individual selves. These entrenched dynamics extend from local communities to global interactions and cut across all imaginable divides: racial, cultural, political, economic, ethnic, and gender. Common platitudes of personal will overcoming all, therefore, overlook systemic inequalities that silently dictate aspects of our lives, often without our consent or knowledge.
Consider, for example:
A corporate CEO can hold sway over his employees’ livelihoods, impacting their access to healthcare, housing, and nutrition, balancing these interests with shareholder concerns.
Stopped at a traffic light, a driver is suddenly approached by an armed person who demands they exit the car, ultimately driving away with it.
A young lawyer up for a partnership he deserves is passed over again and again due to office politics and hidden agendas.
A public health official navigates the complexities of managing a public health crisis, such as a pandemic, where decisions impact the health and safety of millions.
There is, in fact, a world external to us, with many other human minds—billions of them—influencing us and one another. Suggesting that people can simply override every power dynamic they’re entrenched in dismisses the real and complex challenges that those under the yoke of oppression or discrimination face. It also carries the serious risk of misplaced responsibility, dangerously shifts blame onto victims (suggesting that if they suffer, it’s by their own doing), and undermines the imperative for systemic change by overstating the role of personal agency.
But . . .
While it’s essential to grasp the influence of external power dynamics, it’s equally important to recognize the role of personal responsibility and agency. Phrases like “circumstances make men” or “show me your friends and I’ll show you your future,” while correctly highlighting the impact of environmental factors, oversimplify the complex interplay between individual agency and external influences. They risk undermining the importance of personal responsibility and willpower in shaping our lives and are complicit in hope-crushing feelings of learned helplessness that disempower people from all places and walks of life.
The reality, inherently more complex and enriching, transcends the limitations of simplistic maxims.
Acknowledging personal responsibility alongside external constraints doesn’t deny the impact of societal, political, cultural, and economic forces on our lives. Instead, it cultivates a nuanced perspective that appreciates how our internal decisions significantly influence our life’s direction. This balance isn’t about denying the existence of external power dynamics; rather, it’s about recognizing our capacity to navigate and respond to these forces with intention and resilience. While we are influenced by our social, political, cultural, and economic surroundings, we’re also capable of self-determination and control over our responses to these influences.
In other words, understanding the complexity of power within a well-thought-out and meaningful framework doesn’t give us total control of our lives, but neither does it mean that we are powerless. Rather:
The very existence of external influence demonstrates that we have some power over others, and furthermore, the impact of others on us does not render us powerless.
Our power over others?
That’s best exercised through empathy.
Our power over ourselves?
That’s the core of Stoic philosophy.
Therefore, the pages of this book will flesh out a power approach to life: Stoic Empathy, the application of empathic awareness and Stoic principles as tools to understand and navigate power dynamics constructively.
In this paradigm, we strategically use empathy, which in essence is information we’ve gathered about the mental and emotional states of another person, to navigate power dynamics and positively impact our environments and the people within them. Concurrently, the capacity for self-determination and control over our responses to external circumstances is rooted in the principles of ancient Stoicism, which teaches that while we may not have total control over external events, we can steer our reactions to them. Stoicism empowers us to recognize our agency in choosing our responses, thereby retaining a sense of control and self-efficacy. It also is a reminder that some matters are simply beyond our sphere of influence.
Stoic Empathy in Action: A Framework for Human Connection
Stoic Empathy integrates ethical considerations with strategies for influence, offering a path to impact our world while staying true to our values. This approach combines strategic empathy and Stoic principles into a framework for understanding and navigating human interactions effectively.
Let’s look at a few examples of how these two perspectives come together in public, professional, and private life.
Public Health Official During a Pandemic
In the throes of a global health crisis, a public health official stands at the forefront, steering the response to a pandemic that threatens the health and safety of millions. This role involves not only the management of medical resources and the implementation of health policies but also the navigation of sociopolitical landscapes that influence societal behavior and perception.
Impact of Strategic Empathy: In the midst of a pandemic, a public health official’s strategic empathy becomes crucial, employing a nuanced understanding of the public and healthcare workers’ fears, frustrations, and needs. By acknowledging the anxiety of families, the exhaustion of frontline workers, and the skepticism fueled by misinformation, the official crafts empathetic communication strategies that resonate personally, fostering trust and encouraging adherence to health guidelines. This approach enhances community health campaigns’ effectiveness and addresses the pandemic’s mental health impacts, ensuring interventions are tailored to the diverse cultural and socioeconomic contexts of communities, thereby promoting equitable access to resources and support.
Stoic Perspective: Adopting a stoic perspective alongside empathy, the public health official recognizes the enormity of pandemic challenges and the limitations of control, facing the unpredictable virus mutations and variable public health measure compliance. Instead of yielding to despair, the official focuses on controllable aspects: spreading clear information; mobilizing resources for testing, treatment, and vaccination; and applying evidence-based measures to lessen the pandemic’s effects. This stoic approach also equips the official to handle ethical dilemmas and difficult decisions like prioritizing vaccine distribution and imposing health-protective restrictions, underscoring resilience and the importance of a rational, clear-headed approach to problem-solving and decision-making.
Employees and the Workplace Bully
An employee is working for an unreasonable supervisor who has significant control over their lives, including their benefits, time off, and even job security. However, the employee possesses power in their professional development, adaptability, and the pursuit of opportunities inside or outside the company. They can also find empowerment in advocating for workplace rights and engaging in collective action.
Impact of Strategic Empathy: Employees using empathy strategically can better understand the challenges and pressures faced by leadership and their specific boss. This insight can lead to more effective communication and advocacy within the company, potentially influencing the supervisor’s policies and practices. Empathetic employees can also create a more supportive and collaborative work setting, which can improve overall morale and productivity, indirectly influencing the supervisor’s decisions and company direction.
Stoic Perspective: The employee focuses on what they can control—their skills, their adaptability, and their response to change, understanding that their worth is not determined solely by their employment status.
The Inconsiderate Spouse
A person’s spouse constantly makes them late, resulting in trouble at work. This repeated action creates stress and tension in their personal and professional life.
Impact of Strategic Empathy: By employing strategic empathy, the person seeks to understand the underlying reasons behind their spouse’s behavior. They engage in open, empathetic conversations to explore any issues or challenges their spouse might be facing. This approach can help identify potential solutions, such as better time-management practices or mutual agreements on schedules, fostering a more cooperative and understanding relationship. Additionally, the individual can express how the behavior impacts their work, appealing to their spouse’s empathy and encouraging change.
Stoic Perspective: Adopting a stoic perspective, the individual focuses on what they can control—their reactions and their efforts to mitigate the impact of their spouse’s conduct. They might set up contingencies, such as leaving earlier to accommodate potential delays or finding alternative transportation. By maintaining a calm and rational mindset, they can manage their stress and frustration, ensuring that their professional responsibilities aren’t compromised by personal challenges.
The essence of this work lies in its holistic view, providing tools for deep comprehension of others and morally sound actions. Supported by scientific evidence and illustrative stories, this concept bridges ancient philosophy with modern challenges, showing how timeless principles apply today. By updating ancient teachings with contemporary ethical thought, Stoic Empathy emerges as a transformative method, empowering us to wield influence, master the complexities of relationships, and ensure our actions are both impactful and aligned with our moral compass.
Applying Stoic Empathy: Enhancing Negotiations, Relationships, and Personal Resilience
Stoic Empathy, a potent fusion of understanding and emotional resilience, not only enriches our lives but fundamentally transforms our interactions and decisions. By allowing us to connect deeply with others’ perspectives, needs, and emotions, it extends our influence and enhances our effectiveness in negotiations, relationships, and even personal growth. This dual capacity to empathize and maintain emotional balance empowers us to navigate complex social dynamics with grace and strategic insight, leading to more meaningful and constructive outcomes in both personal and professional realms.
For instance:
Negotiations: Strategic empathy enables us to understand and resonate with the perspectives, needs, and emotions of the other party, allowing us to extend our radius of influence, control, and power while fostering an environment of mutual respect and open communication. Stoicism allows us to approach negotiations with a clear, calm mindset so we can focus on objective outcomes rather than be swayed by emotional responses. This dual approach not only aids in reaching more favorable outcomes as well as amicable and effective agreements, but also in maintaining positive alliances post negotiation, a key aspect often overlooked in the heat of the moment. With a balance between emotional insight and rational thought, we can steer negotiations in a way that is beneficial for all parties involved, fostering trust and respect and positioning us as effective, fair negotiators, enhancing our influence in both personal and professional spheres.
Personal Relationships and Workplace Dynamics: Empathy, when strategically utilized, allows you to understand and connect with the feelings of others, enhancing your personal and professional bonds. You can facilitate more collaborative and understanding home and work environments, essential for teamwork and management of both. Stoicism provides a framework for managing your own emotions, which can prevent overreactions during even the most heated moments and lead to healthier and more stable relationships. This balance enhances the depth and quality of our personal connections. It also furthers our abilities and success as current or would-be leaders, because leaders who embody these traits are often more respected and effective. This not only enhances our personal power but also contributes to a more productive and positive organizational dynamic and a greater sense of achievement and satisfaction.
Stress Management and Conflict Resolution: With empathy, we can understand others’ perspectives, significantly reducing conflict and the stress that comes with it. This paves the way for resolution and swaying hearts and minds, even sometimes when it didn’t seem possible at first. The ability to remain composed and objective in stressful situations, combined with the foresight of knowing what you can and can’t change—while also considering the emotional aspects of conflicts—make experts into conflict and stress navigators. The ability to remain calm and empathetic under pressure is a rare and valuable asset in today’s fast-paced and often high-pressure environments.
Personal Growth: Empathy contributes to developing emotional intelligence, critical for both personal betterment and professional advancement. Stoicism, on the other hand, fosters self-reflection and resilience. The practice of Stoic Empathy enhances these qualities, helping us understand and influence the world around us. By continually honing these skills, we adapt better, understand others more deeply, and maintain emotional stability, giving us a significant advantage in navigating the ever-changing power dynamics of our world.
Communication Skills and Problem Solving: Empathy improves your ability to listen and respond effectively, improving communication. Communicating clearly and without emotional bias, which stoicism helps you do—while also being receptive to others’ emotions and perspectives—is crucial in building strong, influential relationships. It lets you not only solve problems, but also innovate in new realms that you thought you couldn’t before. This skill is invaluable in all aspects of life, from personal interactions to professional engagements.
Mental Health and Coping with Change: With strategic empathy, we gain sway in our world while still enhancing the long-term social bonds that are good for our mental health and overall well-being. Practicing stoicism can yield equal if not more mental health, minimizing suffering, expanding joy, and leading us to a more contented life by focusing on what we can and can’t control. Better mental health significantly increases our power to achieve our goals and enjoy the very essence of life itself.
Beyond Borders and Barriers: From Iran to Interconnected
My work with Stoic Empathy followed me far beyond my early childhood in Iran that I described at the start of this chapter. In 1988, when I was 11, we packed it all up to move: Canada was waiting for us. In so many ways, it felt like the “happily ever after” part of the fairy tale—the struggle was over, and we’d won. My child self believed (much more than hoped) that immigrating to a new country would be a panacea for all the troubles we faced. In my youthful innocence, I imagined that the world beyond the reach of air raids and oppressive regimes, the place where freedom and opportunities were abundant, would be entirely problem-free.
Upon immigrating, I was, indeed, free of rockets. Went to a real school and played in the park with my sisters, wearing whatever I wanted. I had a much more open future ahead of me. And yet we left behind our family, our money, and our socioeconomic status; our photo albums, our silver, our Lily—and our very soil. What’s more, I came face-to-face with the multifaceted challenges posed by my financial insecurity, gender, and national origin. These aspects of my identity, which I carried with me across borders, were significant barriers in my quest to establish myself in a world that often seemed indifferent, if not hostile, to my aspirations. The realization that my journey toward empowerment and success would be an uphill battle and fraught with its own unique set of obstacles, even in a Western, democratic country, was a sobering awakening from my childhood dreams.
I quickly learned that even in a society as open and democratic as Canada’s, power dynamics and systemic barriers persist, subtly shaping the experiences of immigrants, people of color, women, and other marginalized groups. I was a fish out of water if you’d ever seen one, without any preparation for adaptation into this new culture, without even the ability to speak to the other fish—since I had no English-language skills before immigrating. I was severely bullied in lower and middle school, a kind of suffering that sometimes made my young mind wonder whether I’d have been better off with rockets and morality police (I wouldn’t have). While I learned English within six months of immigration, it took me until my junior year of high school to find my voice again, to adapt fully to this new world and navigate through it to pursue my goals.
Interestingly, it was debate class that opened my eyes to my ability to craft an emotional and logical argument. Learning that, when presented with a captive audience, I could argue my way into and out of anything, was a revelation—and more importantly, realizing that the more I knew my audience, the more convincing I’d be. I’d been reading rooms and people since I was a toddler. So, I went back to my old tool kit: asking myself, “What are they thinking?” or “What are they feeling?” I kept calm, creating space in my mind to evaluate and think, always holding true to what I believed was right, refusing to take advantage of others’ weakness, and holding compassion as much as I could. There were many failures. But as time passed, I succeeded more and more.
In university, I continued my climb into the world of persuasion. Fascinated by self-discovery and intellectual rigor, I studied neuropsychology and philosophy at the University of Toronto. My work in philosophy emphasized logic and argument as well as metaphysics, beginning with Greco-Roman Stoics and continuing from there all the way to 20th-century thought. At the same time, my neuropsychology research fed my appetite for exploring human nature through evidence-based studies, learning about psychological thought of all kinds, and using cognitive-behavioral psychology as a means of personal control and growth. I didn’t realize it at the time, but looking back, I can see that I’ve been immersed in the study of understanding human beings, including myself, since I was a child.
After graduation, law school and opportunities in the United States seemed like excellent next moves. So I moved a little south, finding myself within the halls of Michigan Law School. But in the U.S., land of opportunity and diversity, I found echoes of the same power dynamics I’d experienced in Canada. Eventually, though with a mountain of law-school debt and no family connections to get me started in the corporate world, I began to see a path of power that was different from the others. My ability to relate to and influence others using psychology and logic, combined with my increasing study of controlling my own emotions during moments of intense stress, fueled a 20-year legal practice in the realm of international multinational corporations (primarily in the fashion sector and the Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH) group of companies, but including others such as Shell Oil and Volkswagen). I could navigate my way through an intimidating courtroom, representing clients in nine-figure cases despite often being the youngest, only woman, or only person of color in the room. I formed alliances within my firm’s partnership, recruited my own major corporate clients (such as Walmart and Google) into the firm, and forged meaningful relationships with my colleagues, many of whom I’m friends with to this day. My legal career also gave me the gift of financial security, and with it, a host of new freedoms.
I found love. We had kids. Four of them.
Meanwhile, I entrenched myself more and more in the study of influence, control, and resilience. Eventually, this led me to teaching negotiation and persuasion using empathy at Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law, changing the world of ideas by giving and producing TED and TEDx talks (over 80 of them), and contributing to literature with as much writing as I could—including this book.
My nearly half century of living and studying Stoic Empathy has therefore become the ultimate integration of control. It can be for you as well. This is because with Stoic Empathy, we engage in the dual process of gaining power and influence by controlling the world around us (using empathy) and the world within us (using stoicism). With core stoic internalized strength, we can slow down the time between stimulus and response, essentially gaining us greater access to a calm stillness and rationality regardless of the power dynamics around us. Mastery over our reactions provides a solid foundation for clear thinking and deliberate action, allowing us to navigate life’s challenges with poise and resilience. Simultaneously, by practicing strategic empathy, we cultivate the capacity to understand and connect with others on a profound level. This empathetic reach empowers us to influence and transform the dynamics around us, fostering relationships and environments that reflect our values and intentions. By harmonizing stoic self-control with empathetic outreach, we enhance our internal fortitude and external influence. This powerful combination allows us to exert control over our inner world through stoicism and extend our reach into the external world through empathy.

CHAPTER 2
COGNITIVE VERSUS EMOTIONAL EMPATHY
Language shows us that naming an experience doesn’t give the experience more power, it gives us the power of understanding and meaning.
— BRENÉ BROWN
Joel Braunold is a public policy entrepreneur. These folks work with foreign and domestic policymakers to implement entrepreneurial strategies that can shift the status quo of entire governmental systems. Joel’s specialization is in how to finance peacebuilding within international conflict resolution. Believe it or not, financing war is much easier than financing peace. For the last decade and a half, Joel’s primary work has been in the Middle East. For many years, he was the CEO of the largest trade association of Israeli-Palestinian and Jewish-Arab peace groups in the world. As the executive director of the Alliance for Middle East Peace, he was instrumental in passing domestic legislation, authorizing a quarter-of-a-billion-dollar peacebuilding fund for the organizations he was serving. He’s now the head of a private think tank, working with leaders in the Middle East and North Africa to find and implement macro and micro peace possibilities. Joel and I are both former fellows of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and still friends. I know him and his family on a personal, “our kids play together” level and can assuredly say that Joel is one of the most compassionate and caring humans I know. And yet, I’ve never seen him become emotionally involved, or take an emotional or political position, in Middle East politics. I’ve watched as Joel, an Orthodox Jew who wears the kippah, works with Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim leaders to facilitate backdoor meetings that many times avoided tragedy or at least permitted communication, balancing that with his Jewish faith without ever displaying an allegiance to either side.
When it comes to contentious issues such as Mideast conflicts and policies, many are steadfast that there is only the right side and the wrong side. Sometimes such passions are held by advocates fighting for their people. Other times, they’re espoused by politicians looking for reelection. For many, which “side” to support isn’t complicated at all but a very simple fact that is observable and discernable by anyone who cares to really look. But if you’re Joel, a peace advocate with the arduous work of directing policy development or facilitating dialogue to end or at least reduce conflict, looking at both sides simultaneously is necessary to do your job. In Joel’s case and that of many other aid and peace workers, without the acceptance and trust of both sides, there would be no dialogue. As horrible as the situation is, it would get even worse. Simultaneously, as a peace worker, you see, hear, and feel the atrocities directly and routinely. You’re viscerally bombarded—usually not in the same way as affected populations (although sometimes in this way as well, given the scale of the conflict), but more so than the average news consumer or distant politician.
“These conflicts are some of the most emotive conflicts on our planet,” says Joel, “and there are very few people who can truly empathize with both sides, because most people believe that empathy would be a form of alignment and solidarity. In addition, these conflicts suffer from the fact that while there’s an asymmetry of power, there’s a symmetry of fear and mistrust. And very few people have had the opportunity or the interest to get to know and understand both sides without judgment or alignment. But I couldn’t do my job unless I figured out a way to do that. It’s not an easy task. But I don’t have a choice.” Joel is only human. How can he keep emotionally distant while gathering enough about each side to facilitate the objectives of his organization and assist in building peace resilience and dialogue even when it seems impossible? Because that’s what his job as a peacebuilder essentially is: the very difficult task of understanding the perspective of the various people he’s bringing together without feeling what they’re feeling.
Far too often we focus only on the emotional connections that empathy can foster while ignoring the cognitive aspects. But those cognitive elements not only give us leverage; they also keep us emotionally grounded, allowing room for greater compassion without allowing our capacity for empathy to collapse. This need for emotional distance might seem obvious if we’re discussing the life of someone in a role like Joel’s, but how about:
a trauma counselor;
a lawyer advocating for a client who’s a teen sexual-violence victim or an innocent criminal defendant;
the owner of a family-owned business who poured her heart into her work for dozens of years before her accountant embezzled her life savings;
a corporate CEO whose success will determine the employment status of hundreds of thousands of people while balancing consumer safety concerns and the environmental impact of their factories;
a parent managing her teen’s emotional turmoil;
a salesperson who faces a quota on one hand and a client who’s a single mom on a budget on the other hand; or
the average couple struggling with conflict resolution?
It’s essential for those seeking greater influence, power, or impact in the economic, social, domestic, political, and corporate spheres to distinguish between cognitive and emotional empathy, regardless of their particular social, economic, or political role in our society, and learn to modulate between the two given a particular situation. The reality is that, in the majority of negotiations, there’s no clear “good guy” or “bad guy.” Real life is complicated and full of gray and ambiguous spaces.
This chapter will explore what empathy is, what factors distinguish cognitive from emotional empathy, how cognitive empathy can help you avoid not only emotional alignment but also empathy collapse, why you should learn to oscillate between the two depending on the circumstances at hand, and how to tactically utilize your knowledge of the “other” and the situation to gain leverage. Most significantly, since there’s already an understanding of emotional empathy in our culture and a wealth of literature on it, we’ll spend more time here presenting you with the second, equally significant and hardly explored half of the empathy spectrum: cognitive empathy.
Empathy Versus Sympathy Versus Compassion
I’m very close with my father-in-law, Joseph, which some people find surprising given how different we are in terms of our political and sometimes even our global ideologies. This is a man whose dad worked the steel mills of Pittsburgh until he died and whose mom ran moonshine and fed the family on potatoes for months to make ends meet when the mill workers went on strike. As a child, he was beaten by the nuns at school if he did the wrong thing, lost friends to the random accidents that involved train tracks or lack of seat belts, and learned to like duck-blood soup because that’s what you ate sometimes if you were a poor Polish Catholic living in a steel-mill town in the 1940s. Joseph pulled himself out of hunger and poverty with a combination of grit, street smarts, and outstanding basketball skills. He graduated Virginia Military Institute with a chemistry degree and a great jump shot, only to be enlisted as an officer in one of the most tragic wars in American history. They gave him an artillery unit and a hundred men. He kept all 100 alive, holding their minds and spirits intact by building a basketball court in the middle of the jungle using artillery boxes. Joseph earned a Bronze Star and a number of buried memories I’ve never heard him discuss. He came back to the wife he married shortly before he left and the son he barely knew, adjusted quickly, took up sales and made his way into the top one percent of income earners in this country. He was thus able to pay for his son’s college, so his progeny didn’t need to join the military or fight a war just to afford an education, and is now spending a very happy retirement traveling (going-to-the-South-Pole-in-his-late-70s kind of traveling). We might vote for opposite parties at the ballot box, but I adore this man nevertheless, which is saying something in these divided times.
I mention Joseph because he’s the perfect example of how difficult it is to understand the concept of empathy. A few years after we met, the family was sitting around in the kitchen and chatting, and Joseph admitted he didn’t know what empathy was. I mean, literally didn’t know what it meant. We all had a good laugh. “Oh, of course you don’t know what empathy is, Joe! They don’t teach that at military school!” That night, though, no one could really explain empathy to Joseph. We tried, but not with much success. He was asking really good questions: “How’s that different from compassion?” or “Isn’t that sympathy?” and “So when you feel bad for someone, that’s empathy?”
It’s not just my military father-in-law; Joseph isn’t alone. Most of us, when discussing emotions and responses to the experiences of others, tend to inadvertently interchange the terms sympathy, compassion, and empathy. This overlap, while understandable given the blurred lines in the realm of emotional responses, underscores a fundamental distinction in how we relate to and understand the experiences of those around us. The night of our conversation, Joseph concluded the evening by deciding that empathy wasn’t necessary at all and that it duplicated a number of other actions and emotions. This is not where any of us wanted Joseph to end up that night!
We circled back to the conversation a few times after that in talks that really helped me understand and frame a very clear definition of empathy as distinct from sympathy and compassion. Let’s discuss it.
Sympathy: “Please accept my deepest condolences.” Sympathy is an external expression, often manifesting as a recognition of another’s misfortune. It’s characterized by feelings of pity or sorrow for someone else’s situation. When someone endures a hardship or a loss, we might offer words of consolation or send a sympathy card. Such gestures act as an acknowledgment of their pain, signaling, “I see your suffering.” While sympathy holds its own importance and provides a way to express concern, it maintains a level of emotional distance. The one extending sympathy remains somewhat removed, acting more as an observer of the pain or discomfort being experienced by someone else.
Compassion: “I’m sorry about your struggle. I’m here to do whatever I can to make things easier for you. Can I bring dinner for the family tomorrow?” Compassion goes a step further than sympathy. It’s not only an expression of sorrow or pity for the pain of another person, but also the desire to help alleviate their suffering. Compassion often involves an element of action or a motivation to act based on concern for the well-being of others.
Empathy: “Your pain in my heart” or “I can see that you’re really excited about this!” In contrast to sympathy, empathy transcends mere acknowledgment. It represents an attempt to truly understand another person’s emotions and perspective. Rather than standing at the periphery, empathy involves a closer approach—striving to grasp the intricacies of another’s emotional landscape. In essence, while sympathy offers a kind gesture from a distance, empathy, in its various forms, seeks a deeper closeness and appreciation, enabling us to navigate the intricate web of human emotions and alliances more adeptly. It’s further distinct from compassion because empathy isn’t necessarily action oriented; in fact, some may feel absolutely frozen by it.
In sum, while sympathy provides a comforting recognition from afar and empathy fosters a deep, shared understanding of another’s feelings, compassion bridges these with the impetus to take tangible steps to ease someone else’s suffering. Each of these emotional responses plays a unique role in human connection, illustrating the varied ways we can respond to the emotions and experiences of those around us. With those general definitions in mind, let’s dig much deeper into empathy.
The Two Facets of Empathy
This profound connection of empathy further branches into two distinct types: emotional and cognitive. Emotional empathy (or “affective” empathy) represents our innate response to others’ states of mind. It’s that instinctual mirroring of emotions when we witness someone experiencing joy, pain, or any other emotion. It’s not calculated; it’s a spontaneous and heartfelt reaction where we find ourselves feeling along with someone as if their emotions resonate within us. It’s spontaneous and yet something we can cultivate. Cognitive empathy (or “evaluative” empathy), on the other hand, is a more deliberate form of insight. It doesn’t necessarily involve the feeling of another’s emotions, focusing instead on comprehending another’s feelings and perspectives. It’s akin to studying someone’s narrative, discerning their challenges and emotions, and subsequently being able to predict or respond to their needs without being emotionally entangled.*
1. Emotional Empathy
Picture you’re watching TV and seeing your favorite character, whom you’ve spent an entire season getting to know and relate to, driving a car. They’re happy in this moment—everything is going great for Jordan, upbeat music is playing in the background, the sun is shining, and the trees are a vibrant green. Suddenly, a ding sounds, indicating a text message. Jordan scrambles to retrieve the phone, eyes darting to the urgent message, and you can feel the tension mounting. Just as you anticipate, the distraction proves disastrous. Another car comes out of nowhere, colliding violently with Jordan’s side in a deafening crash. The world inside the car whirls chaotically—everything spinning, glass shattering, the frame of the car grotesquely twisting. The phone flies out of Jordan’s hand, symbolizing the sudden loss of control.
Your own reaction is visceral and immediate: You find yourself physically recoiling, gasping, or turning your head away from the screen. In this moment, you experience emotions that mirror Jordan’s feelings. Of course, you don’t feel the sharp sting of the glass cutting Jordan’s face or the brutal jolt of the impact as he jerks back. Nothing bad has happened to you at all. Jordan isn’t real—he’s a fictional character. Yet his distress is your distress.
Emotional empathy goes beyond mirroring the emotional state of a fictional character during a dramatic television moment. As it pertains to some shows and movies, such as the dramatic film Black Swan, your brain can mirror the neural state of the fictional character’s brain. Black Swan is a psychological thriller centered around Nina, a committed ballerina played by Natalie Portman. The film explores Nina’s intense psychological journey in the competitive world of ballet, where her quest for perfection leads to a blurring of the lines between reality and fantasy, culminating in a descent into madness.
The climax of the film occurs during a crucial performance of Swan Lake, where Nina’s transformation reaches its peak. Onstage, her passionate dance, combined with powerful emotions and vivid visual effects, fully immerses the audience in her experience. This moment is not just a display of her dance prowess but a representation of her psychological unraveling into full-blown schizophrenia. What does the audience undergo during this scene?
Astoundingly, according to Prof. Talma Hendler (Tel Aviv University’s Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Sagol School of Neuroscience, and School of Psychological Sciences), audiences watching the dramatic scene have brain activity resembling that observed in many schizophrenics. At an event sponsored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Prof. Hendler said, “As Nina is getting crazier and crazier, the audience experiences something like schizophrenia.” We’re drawn into the world of Nina; every pirouette, every stolen glance, each layer of makeup serves to weave the intricate tapestry of Nina’s evolving psyche. With each scene, she becomes more tumultuous and her reality increasingly blurred, immersing the audience in Nina’s descent into madness. The line between her world and the viewers’ begins to waver. Thus, quite literally, viewers’ brain patterns during the film’s climax and Nina’s descent into schizophrenia actually mimic the patterns of schizophrenic people.
The power of storytelling is undeniable and far-reaching, truly demonstrating the depths of emotional empathy. The strength of emotional empathy (affective in nature) lies in its universality. It doesn’t discriminate between real and reel. When we watch characters on-screen, we don’t just observe their behaviors; we live them, feel them, and are often profoundly affected by them. This is the quintessence of emotional empathy—feeling another’s emotion as if it were our own. But while great cinema has a profound capacity to evoke emotional empathy, the impact of witnessing real emotions in real people can be even more striking. In real-life scenarios, the immediacy and authenticity of the emotions displayed carry a much higher weight than when watching a movie. When we observe the emotions of a real person, the connection isn’t just with a character but with a fellow human being. We interact with experiences and reactions that aren’t the product of a writer’s imagination but the genuine article of human experience (sometimes within the context of meaningful and long-term relationships). This personal proximity means that when we empathize with someone in real life, it’s often a reflection of our own experiences and understanding of the world, making the emotional impact more profound and personal.

CHAPTER ONE
The Home
The air in the Children’s Home was heavy, stagnant, as if it were mirroring the weight in Megan’s chest. The usually cheerful murals on the walls seemed dull and lifeless today, their vivid colors drained by the suffocating cloud of despair that hung over the house.
Megan, just sixteen but burdened with more than her years should hold, paced anxiously in the foyer. Her arms were crossed tightly over her chest as if trying to hold herself together, her fingers worrying the sleeve of her sweater. The muffled voices from down the hall grew sharply louder, jagged edges of anger spilling out into the hallway, making her flinch.
Ryan burst through the door like a whirlwind, his seventeen-year-old frame taut with urgency. His eyes, darkened by concern, immediately sought Megan’s. He stopped short, noting the way her body trembled, her eyes rimmed red with tears she couldn’t stop from falling.
“What happened?” Ryan’s voice cut through the tension like a blade, sharp but filled with worry.
Megan opened her mouth but hesitated. Her lips quivered as if forming the words would somehow make the reality of their situation even more unbearable. “It’s bad, Ryan,” she said finally, her voice cracking. “Really bad.”
Ryan heard the noise coming from the hallway, his jaw tightening. Without hesitation, he took a step, determined.
“Ryan, wait!” Megan grabbed his sleeve, her voice laced with desperation. “You can’t go in there.”
Ryan turned back to her, his eyes narrowing in defiance. “I’m not going to just stand here and do nothing. I’m not going to let his father hurt him again, Megan.”
“It’s not about that!” Megan’s voice rose, betraying her own anguish. “Greg didn’t do anything. Not yet anyway.”
Ryan’s brow furrowed in confusion as his mind raced to piece together the fragments of information. “Then what happened?” he demanded, lungs tight with the urgency of finding answers.
Tears filled Megan’s eyes as the next words fell from her lips like broken glass. “Gabriel… he tried to kill himself.”
Ryan staggered slightly, as if the words had physically struck him. “What?” His voice was sharp, almost a shout, but the horror in his tone was clear.
She nodded, her tears spilling freely now. “If your dad hadn’t come home when he did…” Her voice trailed off, swallowed by the pain that clawed at her throat. The incomplete sentence hung in the air like a ghost, and Ryan didn’t need the rest of the words to feel the gravity of what she meant.
Without thinking, Ryan wrapped his arms around Megan, pulling her trembling body tightly against his chest. “It’s going to be okay,” he murmured into her hair. But even as he said it, he wasn’t sure he believed it himself.
Megan shook her head against his chest, her voice muffled but soaked in despair. “How, Ryan? How is it going to be okay when the court granted his dad custody again? We don’t have any rights to keep Gabriel here, especially after…” Her voice faltered, the truth too much for her to finish. Instead, she buried her face deeper into Ryan’s shirt, seeking comfort, or maybe refuge, from the unbearable reality.
Ryan tightened his grip on her as if holding her closer would somehow shield her from the pain. He pressed a soft kiss to the top of her head, his mind swirling with the desperate need to do something, anything, to fix this. But how do you fix a broken system? How do you protect someone you care about from a wolf dressed in the clothing of a father?
“Where is he?” Ryan asked quietly, the resolve in his voice cutting through the haze like a beacon. Megan didn’t answer at first, but she lifted an arm and motioned toward the closed door of the study.
“They’re all in the study. Your dad, Gabriel, and Greg,” she whispered, her voice cracking. She clung to him as if letting go might shatter her completely.
Ryan released her just enough to look down at her, brushing away the tear streaks on her cheeks with the pads of his thumbs. “Stay here,” he said softly but firmly. It wasn’t a request.
“Ryan…” Megan’s voice was filled with uncertainty, her grip tightening on his arm. “Be careful.”
He nodded, leaning down to plant one last kiss on her forehead. Every muscle in his body tensed as he turned to the study door. He didn’t hesitate this time, his hand gripping the doorknob with a steadiness that belied the storm raging inside him.
Behind him, Megan stood frozen, her arms wrapped tightly around herself as if trying to hold in all the pieces threatening to spill out. Her gaze followed him, a mix of hope and fear etched across her tear-streaked face.
This was Ryan, she reminded herself. Her Ryan. The young man who couldn’t sit by when someone was hurting. He was Sean’s son, and like Sean, he carried the weight of the world on his shoulders, even when it threatened to crush him.
And as the door opened, creaking on its hinges, Megan whispered a silent prayer under her breath—for Gabriel, for Sean, and for Ryan and whatever awaited him down the hall.
CHAPTER TWO
The Breaking Point
The late afternoon sun streamed through the open blinds, casting fractured patterns of light across the polished wooden floor of Sean’s study. Dust particles danced in the golden rays, an eerie contrast to the tension suffocating the room. Sean leaned on his desk, his normally calm demeanor teetering on the edge of unraveling. His eyes bore into Greg Flores, the man pacing the small space like a caged predator, his fingers twitching every time his shirt brushed the gun stuffed haphazardly into the waistband of his jeans.
Gabriel sat cross-legged on the couch, his body rigid. His eyes, darkened by fear and fury, never wavered from the concealed weapon. He had seen too much violence in his fifteen short years. Too much pain, too many promises broken. The system had tried to protect him, but it had failed over and over again. And now, here he was again, staring into the face of the man who should have been his protector but had become his greatest tormentor.
“Mr. Flores,” Sean started, his voice calm but firm, “Gabriel is happy here. He’s safe. Won’t you please, just for once, consider what’s best for him?”
Greg stopped pacing and turned to face Sean, his lip curling into a sneer. “Safe?” He practically spat the word. “What do you people know about safe? Filling his head with stupid ideas. He thinks he’s gonna go to school... become some kinda doctor or somethin’?” He laughed bitterly, shaking his head like the mere thought was a joke.
Sean straightened, his eyes kind but unwavering. “Gabriel is smart. Really smart. He has a future in front of him, Mr. Flores. Don’t you want your son to have a better life? To have the chance to—”
“To what?” Greg cut him off, his voice sharp and guttural. “To think he’s better than me? No.” He jabbed a finger in Sean’s direction, his voice rising. “’Cause he ain’t. He’s stupid. Useless. Just like his mom.”
Sean looked Greg in the eyes defiantly. “Gabriel isn’t stupid. He’s a brilliant young man, and he has a beautiful soul. You should be so proud of him.”
Fury flashed in Greg’s eyes. He reached down and tapped the gun in his waistband threateningly. “You’re gonna sit here and tell me how I should feel and how I should treat my son? Who do you think you’re talking to?”
***
Ryan’s sneakers scuffed against the wooden floor as he walked cautiously down the hallway. Each step felt deliberate, heavy, as if what he might face beyond the study door clung to him, trying to drag him back. The muffled voices grew louder with every step. Fragments of anger and tension pushed through the closed door like smoke seeping through the cracks. Ryan strained his ears, but the exact words were swallowed by the thick tension in the air. He clenched his fists and took a deep, shaky breath.
For a moment, he hesitated. His heart was pounding loud enough to overwhelm his thoughts. Part of him wanted to turn back, to retreat to the safety of the foyer and Megan’s tear-streaked gaze. But then there was Gabriel, his best friend, his brother in every way that mattered except blood. And his beautiful dad, who was also more of a father to Gabriel than Gabriel’s real dad ever pretended to be.
No. Whatever chaos waited for him beyond the study door, he couldn’t ignore it. Ryan gritted his teeth and pressed forward.
Suddenly, a deafening gunshot shook the walls, reverberating through everything like a violent crack of thunder. Ryan froze, his breath catching in his throat as his mind raced to process the sound. His knees threatened to buckle, and the world seemed to tilt precariously. He collapsed against the hallway wall, his breath coming in sharp gasps. He had never heard a gunshot inside a house before. Even from down the hall, it was shockingly loud.
Who…? Why?
Ryan remembered that Greg often carried a gun with him. It was part of his tough-guy persona that he tried to flash every chance he got. Greg was in the room with Sean and Gabriel. If his gun went off, that could only mean that one of them…
Oh no! The chorus of alarm bells in Ryan’s head woke him from his daze and propelled him forward. Megan opened the door behind him, eyes wide.
“Go back inside!” Ryan yelled. “Close the door and don’t come out!”
Megan opened her mouth to say something.
“And call 911! Please?!” Ryan pleaded.
Megan nodded frantically and ducked out of the hallway.
Ryan could hear voices frantically yelling from the study. He spun on his heels and sprinted down the hallway, the pounding of his footsteps merging with the rapid thrum of his heartbeat. Every fiber of his being screamed at him to move faster, to reach the study before it was too late.
CHAPTER THREE
Fractured Faith
The first thing Ryan felt was the silence.
He had bolted through the door of the study, his heart pounding so fiercely that it drowned out his thoughts. But now, standing in the doorway, his breath caught in his throat, the world pulled into a vacuum of soundlessness.
The scene unfolded in pieces as his mind scrambled to make sense of the chaos. His father, Sean, lay crumpled on the floor, crimson spreading in a dark, angry pool beneath him. The sight turned Ryan’s stomach, and his hands started shaking as raw panic surged through his veins.
“Dad?” The word barely escaped his lips, a breathless whisper hanging unanswered in the heavy air.
Then his eyes flicked up and landed on Gabriel. His best friend stood frozen, arms limp at his sides. Gabriel’s skin was pale, his hollowed eyes wide with terror. A storm of emotions played across his face. Regret. Fear. Anguish.
“Ryan… My dad… I tried to…” Gabriel trailed off.
Ryan looked at Greg and saw him frantically pacing like a madman. His gun wasn’t in his waistband. Ryan’s eyes darted to the floor where it lay, still smoking.
A soft groan broke the moment, pulling Ryan’s focus back to Sean. His father’s eyes were glassy, weak as blood bubbled from the corner of his lips. Ryan dropped to his knees, scrambling to press his hands over the wound in his father’s chest. The warmth of his father’s blood seeped through his fingers, sticky and unreal, as though his mind couldn’t fully accept that it was happening.
Sean’s eyes fluttered open, his face pale but composed despite the palpable pain. “It’s okay,” he whispered, his voice weak yet steady. “You’re okay.”
“Dad, hold on! Please… please, just hold on!” Ryan begged, tears already streaking his face, but Sean shook his head weakly, the corner of his mouth twitching into a faint shadow of a smile.
“Ryan… son…” Sean’s voice was barely above a whisper, cracked and broken. His words trailed off, his strength too drained to finish the thought.
“No,” Ryan choked, pressing harder against the wound as though sheer willpower could stop the blood spilling out of his father. “You’re gonna be fine. You’re gonna be fine, okay? You just need to stay with me, Dad. Don’t leave me!”
“Ryan…?” Gabriel’s weak voice came out.
Ryan looked up. Gabriel now held the gun. His breathing grew more erratic. His chest heaved, and a broken sob escaped his lips. “If I just would’ve died,” he rasped, his voice drenched in guilt. “It should have been me! Not Sean!”
Ryan’s head shook at the words, his hazy grief pierced by the raw emotion crackling in Gabriel’s voice. There, standing only a few feet away, was his best friend, shaking his head, muttering apologies that couldn’t undo the devastation.
“Gabriel…” Ryan began, his voice trembling.
But Gabriel couldn’t hear him anymore. His hollowness grew, swallowing any connection Ryan tried to offer. Gabriel raised the gun—not toward Ryan, not toward Greg, but toward himself.
“No! Gabriel, don’t!” Ryan’s cry tore through the stillness, but time seemed to collapse around him. Gabriel’s expression softened suddenly, the tortured lines of anguish briefly easing into something that looked alarmingly like peace.
“I’m sorry,” Gabriel whispered.
Greg stepped toward Gabriel with his hand out.
Everything moved too quickly, and yet in slow motion, all at once. The gun fired again with a deafening roar, Gabriel’s body hitting the floor with a lifeless thud.
“No! No! No!” Ryan’s screams echoed through the room as his body heaved with grief and horror, his throat raw as the nightmare refused to relent. His best friend, the kid he had fought for, protected, and loved like a brother, was gone.
And so was his father. Sean’s shallow breathing had slowed to nothing as Ryan looked back down, his hand trembling over the now lifeless form of the man who had been the center of his world.
Sean’s eyes remained open in a cold, lifeless stare. Ryan would never forget the image for as long as he lived. Greg collapsed back against the wall, in shock.
Ryan sat on the floor for what felt like an eternity, his knees soaked with his father’s blood. His world had collapsed in the span of mere seconds, shattering into jagged pieces he didn’t know how to hold.
He stared upward at the ceiling, his breath rasping in quick, shallow bursts, a scream of questions lodged firmly in his throat. This couldn’t happen. Not like this. God wouldn’t… couldn’t…
But as he looked around the room, at his father’s lifeless body, at Gabriel lying just feet away, Ryan felt the weight of despair crushing his chest.
He had always trusted that God would protect the people he loved most. He and his father had given everything to the children’s ranch, to giving kids a sanctuary, to showing them they could rise above the lives they were born into. And yet, the two people he loved most in the world were gone.
How could this be part of any plan?
Ryan’s hands balled into fists, his blood-covered fingers digging into his palms. “Why?” His voice cracked as he choked on his sobs. His throat hurt from crying and screaming, but the question tumbled out again and again, desperate and raw.
“Why did you take them? Why didn’t you stop this? Where were you?”
For the first time since he was a boy, Ryan felt truly, utterly alone.
He felt the faith he had held onto all these years draining away, just as his father’s life had drained away in front of him.
CHAPTER FOUR
A Leap into the Furnace
Eleven Years Later…
The roar of the helicopter blades filled Ryan's ears, a thunderous reminder of the chaos unfolding below. Flames licked at the forest like ravenous beasts, casting an eerie orange glow against the darkening sky. From the cockpit, that world below seemed unreal, yet Ryan knew it was all too real. Sweat trailed a line down his temple, not from fear, but from the sweltering heat radiating upward, mingling with the rising tension inside the cramped airframe.
“Conditions?” Ryan called out, steady, even while fervently gripping the edge of the cockpit door.
“Deteriorating,” Poe grunted, his weathered face illuminated by the flickering light of the controls. To most, the veteran pilot’s voice might have sounded neutral, composed. But to Ryan, it was the tone of a man fighting another layer of chaos unspoken.
Ryan’s lips twisted into a smirk, sarcasm his only weapon to slice through the mounting dread. “Cool. It’s a good day to be alive.”
A voice broke through from the back, lighthearted and teasing. “Relax, Cap. All is as it should be,” Acosta chimed, his grin unfazed even in the face of danger.
“Acosta, shut it with the hippie crap,” Ford snarled, the cool growl of a man who’d seen too many fires, too much loss, to entertain optimism.
“And if I don’t?” Acosta retorted, raising a playful brow.
“Ever hear of chute-less jumps?” Duncan threw in, his voice a menacing rumble as he leaned forward, clapping a hand on Acosta’s thigh. “Could be your day.”
The laughter that followed, though edgy with adrenaline, was an anchor. It was a ritual among the team when life dangled them above the hellfire, their way of pulling sanity from the jaws of madness.
But the time for banter was fleeting. The growl of the helicopter turned into an angry snarl as it pitched sideways, caught in the burst of a sudden downdraft. Ryan’s stomach shot up into his throat as the entire crew momentarily defied gravity, lifted weightlessly from their seats before being slammed back into their restraints.
Across the compartment, Rolo, the youngest member of their crew, clenched his fists until they were bone white, his breath a sharp hiss as wide eyes darted between his teammates.
Jerry, the team's designated source of inappropriate jokes and casual calm, reached over to give Rolo’s shoulder a firm pat. “Breathe, kid. Poe just likes to keep things exciting for us.”
“Copy that,” Poe responded from the cockpit, his voice calm, almost teasing, even as his hands danced over the controls, coaxing the bucking helicopter out of its tantrum.
Ryan unbuckled and moved forward to get a better look at the world outside the windshield. The landscape below was frantic, alive in the way only destruction could be. Flames leaped from treetops, surging waves of orange and red devouring all in their path. Smoke spiraled into the air, thick and unrelenting. Somewhere down there, lives stood in the balance, waiting for these men to carve a path of survival.
He studied the fiery battlefield below, his mind sharp, calculating. They needed to hit the jump site. That was their entryway, the one chance to deploy and contain this beast before it swallowed the entire valley.
“Poe, we need to get to that jump site, now,” Ryan pressed, his voice hard with urgency.
Before the pilot could respond, the chopper lurched again, suddenly plunging. Chaos erupted as the world tilted violently, gear and debris tumbling through the air like toys in a child’s tantrum.
Weightless and caught in the loss of gravity, Ryan’s hand shot to a nearby rail, gripping it tightly as he felt himself suspended midair, the pull of the fall vibrating through every nerve in his body. He looked forward, through the windshield, at the screaming inferno below. It loomed closer with every passing moment, growing larger, hungrier.
“Poe!” His voice cut through the noise, a command wrapped in trust. Poe didn’t have room for mistakes—not here, not now.
The pilot didn’t flinch. Poe’s hands moved with precision, a lifetime of instincts channeling into an instant as he fought the controls. The helicopter groaned under the strain, but slowly, impossibly, it began to stabilize. The violent spinning lessened, the descent slowing until the craft leveled out and began to climb once more, pulling away from the fire’s fiery teeth.
“No backseat driving, Captain,” Poe muttered, a smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth as though they hadn’t just danced on the edge of disaster.
Relief swept over the team, manifesting in muttered curses, nervous laughter, and sarcastic commentary.
“Poe, consider this your official warning,” Ford barked. “Get us there alive, or I’ll haunt you wherever you go.”
From the far corner, Mac, groggily awakening from what had been a blissful nap in the midst of chaos, rubbed his eyes and grinned. “Seconded,” he mumbled, his Australian accent thick with grogginess.
Acosta raised his hand dramatically, letting his voice echo above the noise. “All in favor?”
Shouts of approval erupted, mingling with the steady thrum of the helicopter climbing back to safety.
Ryan allowed himself a deep breath, his body finally sinking into the seat as he fastened his restraints tighter. They weren’t out of the danger zone—not yet—but for now, their crew was intact. Poe had delivered them from the jaws of one crisis, but the next loomed, waiting, a trial by fire.
He looked back at his team, scanning each face etched with determination, nerves, and camaraderie. Despite everything, they were ready. The flames might rage, but they had a job to do.
“Brace up,” he called, his voice stable, commanding. “We’re jumping in ten.”
The helicopter roared onward, carrying the men who would leap into the inferno, not for glory, but because it was what they did. They were more than a team. They were a lifeline, forged by fire. And together, they were unstoppable.
CHAPTER FIVE
The Fire Beckons
The acrid scent of burning wood lingered in the air, clawing its way into Megan's lungs as she wrestled the steering wheel of the old truck. The horizon, once a sharp ribbon of blue, had disintegrated into a billowing mass of black smoke and orange glow. Her heartbeat seemed to pound louder than the strained groan of the engine. The windshield was streaked with soot, the road ahead melting into a suffocating void of uncertainty.
Her trembling fingers smashed the redial button on her phone.
""Please leave your message at the—""
Megan growled and threw the phone onto the passenger seat.
“Come on, guys! Pick up!” she shouted, her voice cracking under the strain of desperation.
The haze thickened, obscuring both the road and her resolve. She stared anxiously at the mile marker that flickered past before slamming on the brakes. Gravel spewed in every direction as the truck jerked to a halt. She spun the vehicle around, tires screaming against the gravel beneath them.
Her prayers whispered through her teeth, as if her words could cut through the heavy blanket of dread settling over her chest.
""Please, Lord, let them be all right. Please.""
The truck bounced across a dirt path lined with gnarled shrubs, the shifting terrain making her squeeze tighter around the wheel. Finally, the ranch house emerged from the smoke like a memory both familiar and lost. Its weathered porch leaned as though bowed under the burden of years and sorrow, but right now, it was a beacon.
Megan threw the truck into park and leaped out. Her boots crunched against the ashen ground as she charged toward the house.
“Harvey! June!” she hollered, pounding her fist against the door. Her cries disappeared into the mournful howls of the wind.
Then, the door creaked open.
June McClain appeared, fear carving deep lines into her aged features. Her hands trembled on the doorframe, knuckles pale against the weathered wood. “Megan, thank goodness you’re here!”
Megan barely registered the relief in the woman’s voice before she stormed inside.
“Where’s Harvey?” Megan demanded, her chest heaving as her eyes bounced between the smoke-tinted ceilings and ancient furniture.
“Out back,"" June replied, wringing her hands. ""He’s trying to get the car running, but it won't start.""
Megan's jaw tightened. Of course Harvey wouldn't leave the property without a fight. His old habit of refusing to ask for help was stubbornly intact.
She turned sharply to June.
“Grab your to-go bag, June, and get in my truck,” Megan barked, her tone resolute and commanding.
“But—what about Harvey?” June asked, her voice light with hesitation and worry. Her eyes were wide, clouded with fear for her husband battling a losing fight against time and machinery.
“I’ll get him. But you need to go. Now."" Megan's voice softened slightly, but the urgency stayed intact. ""Hurry, okay? Please.”
June hesitated, indecision freezing her in place. Then she nodded, her hands quivering as she fumbled for her bag.
“Yes... yes, all right,” she murmured and shuffled to the stairs.
Megan darted out the back door. The oppressive heat slammed into her like a wave, touching her eyes and filling her nostrils with the suffocating tang of burning timber. The smoke kissed the ground, thick and sticky, swallowing the yard whole.
“Harvey!” she shouted. Her voice cracked, the vibration of her fear folding into the thrum of her heartbeat.
Harvey didn’t look up, too busy grumbling at his truck. The back door slammed closed with a violent crack as Megan continued through, her boots pounding against the wooden steps as she froze, staring upward. The sky was a churning fury, an inferno swallowing whatever dared stand in its way. It roared with an animalistic hunger, the kind that devoured lives and left nothing but ash in its wake. Smoke billowed thick and black, curling into an oppressive canopy of despair.
From across the yard came the unmistakable clanking of rusted tools and curses muttered under an old man’s breath.
“Harvey!” Megan shouted, her voice breaking as it had to cut through the chaos.
Harvey McClain stood just outside his dilapidated barn, his wiry frame hunched over the stubborn engine of his ancient Ford pickup. Oblivious. The firelight framed his weathered features, making him seem more ghost than man. He wiped the sweat from his brow with a grease-stained rag, cursing under his breath at the mechanical betrayal.
“You’d better start, you old piece of—”
“Harvey!” She sprinted toward him. Her tone did what the fire’s warnings had failed to achieve. His head jerked up, his deep-set eyes widening as he finally registered her presence.
“Megan?” he said, startled.
“You have to leave. Now! The fire is coming,” she urged, panic slicing her words short. Her chest heaved as adrenaline blanketed her.
A deep rumble tore through the air, followed by a crackling explosion that sent sparks flying into the open sky. She grabbed his arm firmly, steadying him even as her own body fought to remain composed amid the growing tremors of fear.
“Leave? What in the blazes are you talking about?” he replied, his voice struggling to remain nonchalant.
“Look up, Harvey,” she demanded, her voice breaking. When his weathered face finally tilted upward, reality fell upon him like a landslide. For a long second, the gruff farmer said nothing, his shoulders sagging in quiet defeat as understanding bled into his eyes.
Megan didn’t wait for a response, dragging him into the house.
“My truck,” he whispered, the rough edge gone from his tone. Megan could feel his deflation.
Their urgency collided as they raced to the front door. Megan could see June clutching the railing, pale but resolute. “Hurry! The fire is almost here!” she called out, her voice piercing the paranoia-laden air.
“June,” Megan scolded. “You’re supposed to be waiting in the truck.”
“Oh well, I—”
Megan grabbed June’s arm before she could finish her thought and pulled them both to the truck.
Without hesitation, Megan opened the truck’s door and all but shoved Harvey inside. She reached for June, helping her up into the passenger seat before slamming the door shut. Megan darted around, sliding in behind the wheel. Her heartbeat thundered in her ears, drowning out the outside explosions.
The truck roared to life, trembled under her command as she slammed it into drive, and surged forward. Gravel spit behind the tires, pebbles scattering like warning fragments of what they left behind. The heat from the encroaching blaze pressed against the truck, clawing at them like an unseen predator.
For a moment, no one spoke. June clutched the armrest tightly, her knuckles white as her lips moved silently in prayer. Harvey sat rigid, his wiry frame perched with the tension of a coiled spring.
“You two all right?” Megan finally asked, her eyes flickering between the treacherous dirt road and the rearview mirror where the fire’s searing glow chased them relentlessly.
“Yes,” Harvey croaked, finally exhaling. His head tilted toward Megan, sincerity glimmering in his tired eyes. “Thanks to you.”
“You’re an answer to our prayers, Megan. If you hadn’t come for us...” June’s voice quivered before it trailed off into an abyss of unsaid horrors.
“You’re safe now,” Megan replied firmly, her jaw clenched as the blinding smoke tried to obscure the road ahead. She didn’t dare make promises beyond that. “That’s all that matters.”
Her words hung heavy in the truck’s cab, carrying the consequence of accountability they hadn’t asked her to bear but that she shouldered, nevertheless. She grasped the steering wheel tightly, her fingers aching as if the act alone could push them further from danger faster. It was another second before she caught sight of an air tanker slicing the smoky sky.
Harvey shifted forward; his eyes glued to the sight. “Think our boy’s with them?” he asked, the faintest crack of pride and worry sounding beneath the words.
June shook her head vehemently. “I hope not. I don’t want Ryan anywhere near this,” her voice almost breaking.
Megan offered a weak smile, her hands steady even though her mind raced with images of twisted metal and towering flames. “Don’t worry, June. Ryan’s safe. There’s no way your grandson’s out here in this mess. He’s back home in Oregon,” she reassured them, even as fear tugged at the back of her own mind. Could she be sure?
The fire hissed and crackled behind them, a beast unwilling to relinquish its prey. But Megan’s focus never wavered, her determination carving a path through the suffocating chaos.
Ahead lay hope, survival, and the promise of another day. Behind them, the inferno raged on, consuming all but the fragile strength that had guided them away.
CHAPTER SIX
The Dance of Fire and Wind
Ryan didn’t need to look at the clock to know how much time they had left. Time wasn’t measured in minutes here; it was measured in winds that changed direction, in smoke that thickened, and in the sharp hiss of flames devouring what was once a cradle of life. His hazel eyes, normally warm and laced with humor, now reflected the fire’s flickering rage. To the untrained eye, it might’ve looked like chaos. To Ryan, it was the predictable, relentless rhythm of destruction.
The wind swirled again, tugging at the ash-soaked bandanna wrapped around his neck. It wasn’t just a breeze; it was something alive, something playful but with malice woven in its invisible threads. The swaying branches of scorched trees hissed warnings he couldn’t ignore. Ryan’s hand instinctively reached for his radio as his boots sank deeper into the ashen earth beneath him.
""Guardian, update on conditions?"" he asked, his voice even, though his chest tightened. He fixed his gaze firmly ahead, scanning the ruined woodland with a precision that only years of experience could bring.
A crackled response came through. ""Winds aloft holding at eight miles per hour from the north,"" Jerry’s voice rasped through the static.
Ryan narrowed his eyes, irritated with the inconsistency between Jerry’s report and what he could feel against his skin. Yes, the wind told stories if you knew how to listen. Today, it whispered of trouble. ""You might want to re-check your—""
""Winds are shifting to the west,"" Jerry cut in hurriedly. The uneasy silence that followed was shattered by the soft rebellion of bright embers falling like molten stars. Ryan swatted at his sleeve, ashes searing tiny dark marks into the fabric. Around him, the crew stilled, their usual banter replaced with a collective tightening of muscles. He knew what they were thinking. He was thinking it too.
""Copy that,"" Ryan clipped, though his gut churned. Fire was predictable, but unwilling to compromise when you gambled wrong. Looking over his shoulder, Ryan caught Rolo and Ford exchanging worried glances.
""What’s he doing?"" Rolo whispered, clutching the handle of his shovel.
Ford’s voice was low but firm. ""Trying to keep us from getting killed.""
Ryan’s hand shot up, motioning his team to pull back. There was no hesitation. They trusted him not just because he was their captain but because he had seen fire at its worst and understood that it didn’t just take landscapes. It took lives. ""We’re going around to get into a better position,"" he barked into the radio before turning to lead his team up the rise.
And just like that, they moved in unison, like a tide drawn forward by an unseen moon. Behind him, Mac fell into step, his presence a pressure valve that Ryan didn’t even realize he needed.
""Think our brothers on the other side would like to make a wager?"" Mac smirked, his tone rich with the lightheartedness that only someone completely at home in this inferno could muster.
Ryan shook his head, unable to stop himself from laughing. ""Fire not enough of a thrill for you, Mac?""
Mac shrugged, eyes glinting with mischief. ""Just thought a little competition might get the boys’ feet moving.""
Ryan nodded, his shoulders easing. ""Make the call.""
Mac whooped and snatched his radio in one quick motion.
“Hey Team Clueless,” Mac started. “You up for a little sport?”
His words had barely flown through the crackling frequency before Kenneth’s thick Texan drawl answered back, dripping with playful sarcasm. “Always, Aussie!”
Mac piped back on the radio, “Last team back to camp buys dinner and drinks.”
Kenneth radioed back, “Bring your credit card. They don’t take your weird Australian money where we like to eat.”
Laughter erupted from Ryan’s team, drowning out the roar of flames, and for a heartbeat, Ryan could feel the tension break.
But that moment was fleeting.
Ryan’s eyes shifted upward to the towering cumulonimbus clouds beginning to swell above them. Monstrous and unkind, they loomed like silent gods watching the game below. From their swollen bellies, these clouds might birth a storm, a strong counterpart to the fire already devouring the land.

Amazon Reviews:
An entertaining mystery with colorful characters
“An entertaining fun read with a great mystery plot and interesting characters. Yo Beckham uses self- deprecating humor and amusing sarcasm in his telling of the story. The locations (Myrtle Beach, SC and various places In Thailand) provide the reader with interesting and enjoyable settings for the story. I definitely recommend “Trouble: A Yo Beecham Mystery” and I look forward to more in this series.”
Interesting plot lines
“I enjoyed the straight talk and clarity of the author with a dab of sarcastic humor. It seems the main characters deserve to be back for a series of mystery solving escapades. It was an enjoyable read with a twist of cultural humor. I’ll be looking forward for more of this Yo Becham character.”
Want to see more
“Would like to see more by this author after the Covid-19 Era is over. Perhaps there’s time for a sequel?”
Shey Saints Reviews (National Independent Reviewer)
This book is an easy-to-read and fast-paced crime novel that has a relaxed feel. Unlike most crime stories that are usually distressing at some point because there are times when you don’t understand what the hell is happening or what the author’s talking about, this book is clear and precise. Also, the author used a conversational tone with a touch of humor, making the story entertaining.
The two things I like about this book are Yo and detective Doug’s real friendship, and Yo’s relationship and conversations with Ping, his Thai girlfriend. I think the language barrier and culture difference are so adorably amusing.

To Nirawan,
I owe my trips to Thailand to her
and thank her for her patience while
I ignore her to write this.
Note to Readers:
I always try to avoid overly graphic content while still dealing with real, adult situations.  The first chapter of this story is the most graphic I ever write and I think it fits my standards and audiences.  Terrible things really happen and my description sets the serious mood that should be appreciated.  But rest assured, the balance of the book does not follow such a theme.
I write stories that I like to read: Serious, insightful, touch of humor and with characters I could like.
Hope you enjoy.

TROUBLE
By Jack Burbank
ONE
With a Boston Red Sox cap pulled far down over their forehead and under the cover of a moonless night, the shooter knew that any camera could only pick up the cap and maybe a telltale bushy mustache.  But the camera would have, at most, a split second before it was eliminated, and a bushy mustache nowadays would hardly be much of a lead.  Taking perfect aim with the silenced AR-15 rifle, the rear security camera was quickly dispatched. Moving forward, a four-foot long two-by-four that had been hid near the rear emergency exit door earlier was retrieved and wedged in tightly between the ground and doorknob.  There would be no escape through this exit.
At the front of the building, the time was taken to scan the parking lot for any unexpected witnesses or situations that may affect the escape but there was not a soul to be seen and the way was clear.  Aiming the AR-15 again, one more shot took out the front security camera from its side leaving no meaningful recorded image.
It was late for a church meeting of any kind, but the shooter had been told that this meeting would go late, maybe well into the night.
Gliding through the front doors, two men talking in the rear of the hall stood in shock as they beheld a scene out of a bad movie, freezing at the sight of a rifle taking dead aim at them.  They were cut short with two bursts, the pops causing all in attendance to swivel around.  Then, one by one, each were taken out.  It was a mid-week bible study group of just a handful of the more loyal supporters, in an off-the-beaten-path church.  All were eliminated, with no witnesses and for now, no sirens or warnings emanating to alert the police.  So far, all was going as planned.
The shooter worked swiftly now, first disabling the fire alarms, then a quick check of the restrooms in case someone was inside and finally pulling out a plastic container of gasoline from a duffle bag, splashing it around the seats and carpeting and any flammable materials nearby.  Enough was saved to cover the way leading to the front doors as exit was made.  It was torched as the doors closed and the shooter adhered to the plan made well in advance, making their escape. The flames would be seen ten minutes later, more than enough time to slide into anonymity.
______________________________________
Charlie Hilliard was never so scared in his life.  Crouching on the toilet in the men’s room and holding the door shut by grasping the tiny slide lock with his fingers, he said a quick prayer that the shooter wouldn’t check the room too carefully.  He had been about to come out when he heard some strange pops and thought he recognized them as gunshots being fired through a silencer.  After a few seconds, he cracked the door open only to peek a view of two of his friends lying on the floor and a shooter taking aim at the remaining attendees.  With no choice, he scooted back to the stall and took what he hoped would be life saving refuge.  He could hear helpless pleas and wails as he took refuge.
He had counted about a half dozen shots, he couldn’t keep up or be sure, but knew that was about equal to how many had attended this evening - his wife, included.  A tremendous grief engulfed his body as he quivered almost uncontrollably.  He wasn’t a coward, he had run into life-threatening situations several times in his life, successfully thwarting a few potential disasters, but his mind was still clear enough to know that there was nothing he could do here.  He would be sacrificing his own life in a futile attempt to save anyone else if he tried.  He decided to lay low, quivering from sorrow as he held the door shut tightly.
When the shooter had thrown the men’s room door open, Charlie could sense that they never stepped in.  He could barely hear the restroom door close but knew the shooter had remained outside.  Then, in an instant, he heard the definite sound of the front door opening and shutting and almost immediately heard a whoosh of fire igniting and a strong smell of gasoline penetrating the restroom. He remained still, not knowing what he would be running into if he tried leaving.  But he could tell the flames and smoke were spreading fast, too fast for the shooter to still be inside.
Knowing he had little time to decide on a course of action, he opened the stall door slowly and crept carefully to the rest room door, pushing it open carefully.  He couldn’t believe the scene - how fast the flames had engulfed the old, wooden floor of the lobby!  It was a wall of flames and he’d have to run through six to ten feet of flames to make his escape.  And who knew what he’d face outside if he made it? But having little choice, he doubled back to the sinks, ran both knobs and soaked himself all over as fast as he could.  He grabbed handfuls of paper towels, soaked them and held them over his head letting the water dribble down his back and sides.  Then, taking a deep breath and still holding the wet towels to his head and face, he broke into a run through the inferno and barged out the door.  Probably less than three seconds, but he could feel the flames singing him up his legs, on his sides and especially his left arm.
He hit the ground and rolled, smothering out the flames while trying not to cry out in case the shooter was still in the area.  Gasping, hurt and bleeding, he looked up to his right side and saw an amazing sight!  He blinked his eyes to clear them and confirm the strange scene before him.  That’s when the shooter came into clear view, holding the rifle in a straight aim for Charlie.  Two rounds and Charlie buckled into a curled position taking a hit in his right side and another between his neck and shoulder.  The pain was excruciating and he accepted that this was the end.  He could see his right hand was bloodied and through a fog was able to discern the shooter pulling away for the final escape.  With precious little time left, he wanted to do something to help others have something to go on.  As the fog got thicker, he took his bloody finger and started writing on the pavement what he thought might be the best clue, but he could barely get two letters scrawled out before the fog thickened into the eternal black.
TROUBLE
By Jack Burbank
TWO
I’m Yo.  Trouble finds me.  That’s not to say I look for it or go causing any, far from it.  But it seems to find me wherever, why-ever and whatever I’m doing.  You’ll see.
So I’m in the middle of my smoking break. I don’t smoke, never did, but it’s what the owner wants to hear if you’re going to dare sneak outside for a stretch in some fresh air, and I can’t help but notice a pitiful Honda moped puttering and wobbling into a spot between a Tesla and a Miata.  It’s close to midnight and that tells me two things:  He’s on a DUI moped permit and he’s already had a few, searching for a bar that will still serve him.  If he lived on one of the boats in this marina like I do, I’d have no problem.  But I have my bartender’s license to protect, so I took notice of what he looked like and went back to work.  I had taken more time than I should have and wondered if I had been missed.
As I approached the bar I could see Jimmy hustling off with a tray of drinks for a table.  Jimmy usually works the bar but tonight had to sub for a missing waitress.  I had noticed him stepping up to the bar with an order as I left for my break a good while ago.  I sure hoped he hadn’t waited that long for the drinks.  I’d apologize later.
The guy entered as I was crafting two old fashions and a Saphire martini, extremely dry, olives if they’re small, twist if they’re not.  Picky martini drinkers, I thought - the worst of the lot, and yes, that included me.  Then the guy sits down on the end stool on my side of the bar, so it falls to me.
“Greetings!” I say, “What’ll it be?”
“Gimme a Jack and Coke, hold the Coke,” he said, amused at himself. 
I wish I could have got him on a fake ID or no ID, but he was clearly of age, maybe forty-plus.  So I poured him a Coke and held the Jack Daniels hoping he’d take the hint.
“It’s on the house,” I said, and looked at him as understandingly as I could muster.  He sniffed.  He looked back at me as non-understandingly as anyone could muster.
“What’s the gig?” he snorted, like he’s not going to take this.
I leaned into him closely.  It may have been close but as I was told in bartender’s school, there’s no greater distance between people as between a bartender and a drunk customer.  Softly I said, “I know you’ve had a few already tonight.  I’d like to help keep you from any more trouble.”
He stiffened.  I could see an assault taking shape.
“Trouble!  What’re you talking about?”  He didn’t look happy.
I grimaced a bit, looked around.  This could go a few ways I thought.  So I nodded in the direction of two tables off to the side of the bar.
“Only one of them may be in uniform,” I said, “but the whole bunch of them are law officers.  You’ve got a few from Myrtle Beach and a whole lot from Murrells Inlet, Surfside, everywhere.  It wouldn’t take too much for them to think maybe you’ve had a few too many, especially if they get a glimpse of you pulling away on your DUI-putt-putt.  So I’m hoping you’ll drink the Coke, say, ‘good-bye’, and go home.  Safely.”
He turned and stared, at first dubious and ready to come across the bar and set me straight.  As he turned, a faint odor of booze and BO wafted up to my nose.  But he slowly cooled, sighed and came back to his Coke.  He gave me a thumbs-up and I breathed a sigh of relief.  Another troublesome episode defused.  Funny thing, I’ve used that ploy a few times and it always worked, but this time the tables were actually full with real police officers! 
He downed half the Coke, laid a fiver down and scrammed.
While serving and talking up some tourists from Ohio, I couldn’t help noticing a lot of movement at the cop tables. While a few were talking on their phones and rising with worried looks on their faces, three were already flying out the door as all the other phones and pagers started going off.  In the midst of the mass exodus, Doug was about to flee but he remembered me, and the tab, and rushed over in a panic.
“Yo, we’ve gotta go.  We’ll settle next time.”  Then he leaned close and very softly brought me more trouble.  “Big shooting at the SeaSide Church.  Fatalities.  We gotta get there, but stay close.  This is big – national.  I want to talk to you tomorrow when I know more.”
He would have been out the door leaving me stunned, but I snapped out of my shock and yelled to him, “I’m gone tomorrow.  Headed to Thailand.”
He turned around while still pressing through the door. 
“I forgot.”  He tapped his head as to say, “doh!” then said, “Keep in touch.  I think we’ll want to talk with you.”  And he was gone.
Now why would the chief detective of the Surfside Police Department want to talk with me about a shooting in a local church?  Same reason “Deck 383” has become the natural hangout for half the police staff for most towns around, especially their detectives.  Some time ago word got out that I was a novel writer, writer of mysteries.  Some brainiac on the force walked in to our bar, of all the towns in all the world, and starts chatting me up about a jewelry store heist they couldn’t get a lead on and dropping more details than I knew he ever should.  Then I realized he was hoping I could maybe come up with something, add a little insight as to how everything fit together  - something, anything! 
My twisted novelist mind instead started to think of how I could use this in a story, tried to work out how it might play out with some interesting characters.  In a moment of what some might call “inspiration”, I blurted out a scenario that I thought would make a great story.  But he hears this and thinks I solved his case! Unfortunately, it did.  Word soon got out that the crazy novelist bartender was pretty sharp and next thing I know, all sorts of badges began showing up, introducing themselves to me.   Well, they were a nice bunch overall and Deck 383 soon became a regular after-hours hangout for police from several neighboring communities.  I sure don’t solve most of their crimes, but I keep the door open because I get material that I’d never get any other way. They keep coming because every once in a while I come through.  And as you might imagine, rumors build and get exaggerated.
But this shooting, in a church, what could I do about this?  I’d be out of the country and I didn’t know if I’d be able to do any texting or calling and who even knows if I’ll get Internet enough to Facetime or email.  I expected to be incommunicado and frankly, was looking forward to it.  Why wrap me up in this trouble?
_________________________
I’m always the last to leave.  I live on a boat docked thirty yards away, a beautiful 38 ft. Catalina sloop named, what else?  Trouble. It was a beauty with every amenity and feature a young, successful professional could ever want, but I live on it anyway. It’ll be a lot of fun if I ever learn to sail. 
The restaurant and bar, “Deck 383” is a picturesque dream out of a Key West scene and nestled into what must be the quietest and most secluded marina around.  Located on the Intracoastal Waterway, the water’s typically calm and protected, but there’s scarce few sailboats that moor here.  It’s too long of a trawl to get to the ocean, but then again, I don’t know how to sail so it makes no difference to me.  I put port here to live.  Somewhere there’s an old Navy admiral rolling over in his grave thinking, “That’s not what a ship was built for.” 
I love the life here.  It’s quiet, beautiful, and I could write during the day with few disturbances. The walk to work to tend bar each night, and then back, couldn’t be more convenient.  Everyone else working here at the Deck lives a normal life in a real home a short drive away and they bug out first, leaving me to lock down.
“Locking up late tonight, aren’t you, Yo?”  I recognized Bab’s voice immediately, surprised she was up so late herself.  I turned to confirm it was her.  The moonlight reflected well off her 88-year old face and a smile formed on me as I again marveled at her spry step and youthful vigor.
“We stayed open as long as we could,” I responded.  “We were waiting for you to come over for your last-call-nightcap.”
“Ohh, I won’t be ready for that for another few hours,” she kidded.
We shot the breeze for a few minutes while I locked up and turned over the outside deck chairs.  Then I asked what she was doing up so late strolling on the docks.
“Trying to wake-up a deadbeat.”
I gave her the squint-stare, pressing her for more information.  As the live-in manager of the marina, Babs was always available for any emergency, complaint or general insurrection that might arise from us tenants, some of us pirate-wanna-be’s.  She was also the bookkeeper, making her the “collector”, and I would never want to be on her list.
“Your neighbor, with the big, blue imitation yacht, is three months down and I just can’t raise him.  I saw him drive in and gave him five minutes to walk to his boat and get settled before I followed him to hound him, only to be greeted by a dark and locked-up floating home.  And he won’t answer my knocks.  I know he’s in there, I saw him go in.”  Her frustration was readable.  “The schmuck owns a big boat like that and can’t even afford his rent and electricity.”
She was right - the schmuck was a nuisance.  I never met him myself but his loud music just two slips away drives me bananas when I’m trying to write.  And here’s Bab’s, going above and beyond what any manager should be expected to do, out here at 2:00 in the morning trying her best to track down the scoundrel.
And I had an idea of what to do. 
“Babs, go to sleep.  Let’s see what the morning brings.” 
She smiled, nodded and patted me on the shoulder.  Then she said, “I know.  Tomorrow’s another day,” and left while waving me over her shoulder.
“That would be today,” I called out, but I didn’t think she caught my drift.
I retraced my steps, unlocked the door and went in to grab a handful of toothpicks, then went back out and locked up.  This was going to be trouble.  Remember, it found me. 
As I approached the scum’s slip, I could see that Bab’s was right about the boat being locked up and dark.  I could see no indication of a curtain or blind being pulled aside with sneaky eyes peering out, so I was sure he was either asleep or otherwise occupied, not too concerned about what was happening outside his boat.  A glance at his power hookup on dock told me it wasn’t locked as many are, so I could avoid the noise I would have had to make otherwise.  Again, I didn’t go looking for this trouble.  Well, maybe a little.
I crouched in front of the hookup, pulled the plug and quickly jammed as many toothpicks into the sockets and ground hole that I could, breaking them off level to the base.   I threw the remnants into the water and scurried away. It would take him a while to pull them all out, likely having to first contact Bab’s about cutting the power while he worked on it, and that’s when she could let him have it.   Or he would take the chance that he could handle it by himself with the power still on, which is what I was hoping for.  I doubted he had either the tools or the knowhow to do it right, but probably the nerve to try.  I think he was from New York.
________________________
Doug had texted me five times since leaving Deck 383 for the shooting, all quick texts that reflected the urgency and drama of the situation.  I knew there were nine dead before the news ever had it.  Nine. Everyone that was in the church, not one escaped.
Just as I came aboard my boat and unlocked to the galley another text came through.
“FBI just arrived, ATF on the way.  We get booted soon.”
It would be useless to text him back as I knew he was busy.  But I scrolled back to re-read his earlier texts to see if he was trying to tell me anything I could work on.  I never bragged that I had any more insight than any of them, less in fact, but since Doug and a few other officers thought I had the mind of a criminal (I must to write the kind of things I write about) and of a sleuth detective (I do manage to solve all the crimes I write about, but then I made them all up to begin with), so Doug likes to keep me abreast of all the crimes he comes across.  I let him because he brings me more material than my devious mind could ever make up.
First one:  “All dead.  Watch news – this is national.”
Second one:  “No witnesses or gunfire reports but all shot.  6 women, 3 men.”
Third one:  “Cameras shot out.  No tracks, clues, nothing left behind.”
Fourth one:  “8 dead inside.  1 man dead in parking lot.”
Fifth one:  “Scene secured, for the big boys.”
I wondered, why so many churches?  It seemed like just a few months ago the Charleston episode broke, not more than two hours away.  Other churches nationwide are also attacked.  And schools!  Why so many of the most innocent?  I know I’m not unique in wondering this, what sane person doesn’t.  But I’ve yet to hear a good answer.  I shook my head at the gravity of what happened just a few miles up the road.
I’d have to put it to bed for now.  I had a few things to do and had to get some sleep.  I was booked to go to Thailand tomorrow - make that today, late morning.  I’d talk to Doug while at the airport.  Something told me he’d still be working.

District FBI Special Agent, James Kelly, needed no introductions.  Before his car even came to a stop, the Myrtle Beach and Surfside police captains along with the Horry County Sheriff, three other high ranking officials and two marshals were at the car to meet him.
“Not all at once,” Kelly implored, seeing them all gather quickly to be first to state their facts and concerns.  “Which one of you is Surfside?” a crumb thrown to show respect for proper jurisdiction, which would soon be forgotten.
Chief Lynn stepped forward, hand in the air, and introduced himself.
“How many?  Officially.”  Kelly had been thoroughly briefed and assumed that he already knew the answers but needed to hear first-hand and determine who else was on top of things.
“Nine,” Lynn spoke.  “Eight inside, one out.”
That surprised Kelly.  He had gotten no report of a body outside, but things had been so chaotic, he couldn’t know for sure if he was even given the correct address.
“How’d that happen?  Man, Woman?”
“Male, likely early forties.  We assume he survived the shooting inside somehow.  From the way he had fallen, with multiple burns up and down his body, two gunshots taken to his side and blood only splattered where he fell, it looks like he ran through the flames and into a sniper.”
Kelly took this all in and sized up Chief Lynn.  All seemed credible and he decided he could work with Lynn.  He asked to be taken to the outside victim.
“So he died immediately?”  Kelly asked.
“Almost.  He definitely didn’t last long as the shots were pretty accurate and deadly.  But it looks like he tried to write something with the blood on his hands.”
A classic movie scene, thought Kelly, but something that hardly ever happens in real life.  Whatever came next was going to be taken with a grain of salt, but he had to ask anyway.
“What did he write?”
“Just two letters, it seems, “h” and “e”.  Lynn could see a slight smirk on Kelly’s face but didn’t know what it could mean.  So he added, “Likely points to a male doing the shooting.  That’s what we think.”
Kelly put up his hand to halt, a real smirk on his face now.  “Not much of a clue.  Virtually every mass shooting in this country and around the world is done by a man.  Rarely is a woman even involved.”  Noticing the blank looks on the local officers faces, he could only add, “A wasted effort if he was trying to give us a lead.”
________________________
“So I leave in about eight hours.  I dread the long flight.”  I was on my laptop, talking with Niralyn, my Thai girlfriend, better known by her nickname, “Ping”.  All Thai people have nicknames that are pretty funny I think, but then, who am I to talk?  This would be my second trip.  The first trip was to confirm that neither of us smelled or waddled when we walked or things like that.  You see, our whole courtship was through emailing, Skyping and using Line, the Asian answer to Facetime, though I think they had it first.  So you can imagine we were both interested in meeting in person to make certain we had a clear image of the other.  Evidently, even after an almost 48 hour trip door-to-door, I showed up not smelling. 
“It’s so late here now, if I get two hours of sleep I’ll be lucky.  But with 24 hours of flight time and a long layover in Narita ahead of me, I think I’ll catch up.”
She smiled.  That always weakens me.  “I wait for you,” she says. That always does too.
It was a close friend of hers, living here in the area, and her friends that would often come to Deck 383 for happy hour and then stay for the happier hours.  We would joke and kid around, but she was engaged and I’m not that kind of a boy.  But as she was about to leave the state for her wedding, she asked if I’d mind emailing or Skyping her good friend back in Thailand.  The ruse was that her friend was trying to polish her English and having someone to communicate with in English would help.  It sounded good to me.  Besides, I never had me a Thai girlfriend before.
After our second email, with pictures included and her writing “I goofy”, meaning her, and that she thought I was funny and then signing it with  :)))))))))))), we graduated to Skyping.  With apologies to Renee Zellweger, she had me at :)).
I told her a little about the shooting but didn’t want us to get too morose.  Frankly, she couldn’t fully understand.  Thailand is from all reports such a peaceful land and the culture is one of respect and patience, though a mass shooting at a shopping mall during my first visit shook the world and proved to be “the exception that proves the rule”, whatever that means. Anyway, this patient culture was evident from Niralyn’s personality and in meeting many of her friends and family through Skype and Line.
“I not understand,” she said with a sincere, puzzled look.
“Well… No one really does,” I struggled to explain, “but here in the U.S, things like this happen.  A lot.”
Her eyes widened.  “I so sorry.”   She shook her head in disbelief.
“Well, it doesn’t involve me, but I have a lot of friends on the police force and they’ve been on the scene since it started.  I’ll be anxious to keep up with the story even when I’m with you in Thailand if I can get the news there.”
I know very well she only understands half of what I say, but she’s smart enough to get the gist and we seldom misunderstand each other.  All thanks to her.  I’m a man and don’t understand half of what women say in English as a rule.
“I help you.  I make hot spot for you everywhere we go.”
That sounded good, but I didn’t know what a hot spot was.  I’m in my late 40’s, just old enough to not be tech savvy.  She’s in her very early 30’s, just young enough to be.  “Hotspot” sounded to me like it could be trouble.  But fun trouble - I’d just have to wait to see what she means.
We said our good-byes for the night and I promised to “Line” her from the airport just before boarding.  I’d have a quick hop to Newark out of Myrtle Beach, then an eighteen-hour flight to Narita, then almost six more to Bangkok.  Hope I’m alive to meet her.
Just before turning in I checked my phone again for texts from Doug.  There was one more:
“Standing on 17 Business, controlling traffic.  Out of the loop from now on.”
TROUBLE
By Jack Burbank
THREE
Rushing down the dock to meet my friend who would drive me to the airport, I couldn’t help but chuckle as I ran by the deadbeat’s boat.  He was outside with a sorry looking tool kit that was probably purchased from a Dollar store, kneeling at his power hookup.  He had a screwdriver in his hand but was replacing it with what looked to be an awl as I ran past without saying more than a muffled “’Sup?”  I had just rounded the first corner of the dock when I heard a pop, some rather loud sparks and a bit of a scream but didn’t bother to look back.
Roy was waiting for me at my car.  He owns the only cigarette boat docked here at the marina, kind of cool, but I hate the noise, the smell of petro and the hard bounces.  Give me a sailboat any day.  On a motorboat you’re always rushing to get somewhere.  On a sailboat, you’re already there.  But Roy was a good friend and willing to drive me and my car to the airport, drop me off and return my car to it’s spot for the two weeks I’d be gone.  He owned a souped-up Porsche and kept it for show more than driving.
“That’s all you’re bringing?” he asked, staring at my laptop case and one rather small carry-on.
“I try to keep the airplane light.  Better speed.”
He harrumphed.  “Too bad the other 267 overweight and over-baggage’d passengers didn’t feel the same way.”
It didn’t deserve a reply.  I travel light because it speeds up everything on my end, from checking in to checking out.  I always wear a sport coat for the extra pockets and something to keep warm with at altitude.  And the airlines have yet to lose any baggage that I was holding on to.
The small talk was hardly small.  We were enwrapped in the news of the shooting.  While I had been one of the first to hear of it late last night and was texted developments throughout the night, Roy hadn’t heard anything until he woke up this morning and went on-line.  Not the cheeriest way to start a day.  Names of the victims had still not been released but I doubt there was a person in town that wasn’t dreading that they might know one of them.  Most of us knew of the church, but not many of us know which of our friends go where.
“You heard anything from Doug?  Any inside information?”  He knew Officer Forrester well as they were both regular features at the bar.
“Doug got the first call I believe.  So far, the inside information is that there hasn’t been a single clue found.”  I pondered that a bit, and then added, “The shooter must have planned pretty well.”
We talked the subject out after about ten minutes, a scene that no doubt was taking place all over the Grand Strand area, even the whole country by now.  But until more information was forthcoming, there wasn’t much further the discussion could go.  So we sat in silence a few more minutes, lost in our own thoughts.
“Yo,” Roy asked, a little suspiciously, “you live on a sailboat.  You’re a novelist, of sorts. You’re a bartender.  You’re single.”  He stopped and threw me a glance as if something strange were about to come.  “You should be the coolest guy around!  Even cooler than me,” he said, peering over the top of his Ray-Ban shades and no doubt with reference to his cigarette boat and exotic car.  “So why do you drive a grey, older Ford Taurus? With a roof-rack on top to boot!”
I get that a lot.
“It’s not just a Ford Taurus,” I said.  “It’s the fastest Ford, or fastest any other sedan for that matter, on the Strand.”  That meant the Grand Strand, from North Myrtle Beach through Georgetown, even beyond.
He laughed.  “It’s a used, stock car.  You did nothing to it, no super-charger, no exhaust modifications, no tricked-out wheels, no-nothing!  How is it the fastest Ford around?”
“Drive me around enough and you’ll see.  You might not notice on this trip, but after a few times out, you’ll see.”
He gave me a quizzical look, but conceded.  A “to-be-continued” hung in the air as he dropped me off at the terminal.
TROUBLE

With top forensics experts having been flown in overnight, the scene looked more like an archaeological dig than a murder scene.  It was a crisscross patchwork of sticks and string-defined small squares of areas to be carefully combed for clues and objects to collect and catalogue.  Each had a chalk number sprayed at the corner or a numbered tag pinned to the ground.  With no obvious items of evidence appearing to the dozens of police and officers who had arrived earlier, it was obvious that a much more careful and detailed search needed to be used in the hope of collecting hair samples, threads from the shooter’s clothing, errantly discarded debris, a gun casing, anything.  All involved were amazed at how clean the scene was.  Somebody knew what they were doing.
Special Agent Kelly was getting irritated at the slow progress, but knew better than to show it.  With the burnt-out shell of what used to be an historical church still smoldering in the background, Kelly was desperate for something he could act on.
“What’ve you got on tire tracks?” he asked of the two officers he had assigned two hours ago.
“Not much,” the more senior of the two replied.  “Nothing on the blacktop.  The few patches of sand or gravel didn’t give us enough of a base for any meaningful print.  The gravel leading out gave us three or four semi-useable impressions, but I wouldn’t get my hopes up.  Plenty of cars in and out of here, so even if traceable, it could have been the Pastor himself that left it.”  Then, a little snide, “I don’t have him as much of a suspect considering he’s likely the main victim.”
Kelly winced.  He’d had his share of fruitless murder scenes and understood the frustration, but he wasn’t going to telegraph it.  He patted the officer on the shoulder and headed back to the makeshift tent that would be his office either until the end of the day or until something turned up.  Other than twelve bullets, two dug out of the walls where the cameras were set up and ten extracted from the nine dead victims, nothing seemed to be left that could be considered anything close to a clue.  If the rifle could be found, the bullets could be tied to it, but without the rifle, they wouldn’t serve much use.
_________________________
I got to the airport with less than two hours before my international flight. Roy was mildly surprised that we made such good time.  He thought it would take a little longer, but never connected the thought of my car being faster than it looked.  He’d eventually catch on.  My booking stated I should arrive three hours early but computer bookings never heard of small airports.  Our security line here usually takes twenty minutes.  Gotta love them.
Past security, I looked for a comfortable seat to camp out in while I Lined Niralyn.  I passed the CNN news monitor and caught just enough to know they were blaming Trump for the shooting. 
I settled in, took out my laptop, tied in to the airport Wi-Fi and made contact with Niralyn, whose time was ahead of us.  I doubt I could have picked a girlfriend farther away, but in a way it was good.  With exactly a twelve-hour difference, the conversion was easy.  Eight in the morning here was eight in the evening there. 
Her face filled my screen, a sight that would make any computer look good.  Shiny, coal-dark Asian eyes, long, soft, jet-black hair and a smile that was drop-dead.  Then she smiled, what she calls a “wide-smile”.  I smiled back.
“Hey.”
“Gooot Morning!,” she replied.  That’s how she talks.
So we said our “hello’s” and a few other things that have nothing to do with this story, and then she wanted to know more about the shooting.  As if we all didn’t.
“There’s so little any of us know, I’ll have to wait until I get to Thailand and then catch up.  I know a lot of the police here,” an understatement to be sure, “and some of them will email me progress reports.  Unofficial, for sure, but that’s the way I get my news.  It’s all off the record.”
A puzzled look came over her face, as if to ask, “Why give you reports?”  But I ignored it for now.  She knew nothing of their misled trust in my supposed uncanny ability to solve tough cases.  I’d explain more when we were together.
As we spoke, I could sense a slightly different attitude from her.  Strange, since this should be a great time for both of us what with my second trip to come see her, and I’ve never known her to be anything but upbeat.  So I probed a little.  Funny how a woman can change you – I’ve never probed.
She tried denying anything was wrong but I knew better.  So we danced around the matter for a bit, then she finally let me know a little about what was happening.
“My mother may have to sell business.”
They lived in Patong, on Phuket Island, arguably the most popular tourist destination in Thailand.  Her family owned a very quaint restaurant and bar, if you call Thai bars a bar.  I’ve tried a lot of them on my first visit and hadn’t found a real bar the whole time.  They lived above the restaurant, called the Papaya Garden, where they had five additional rooms for rent making it a hostel.  For only working sixty hours a week, a normal workweek for Thai people, they made a very comfortable living.  The whole family was involved, the mother, Niralyn, her sister and two brothers.  Her father had passed a decade ago after working this inherited property into one of the Patong Beach’s more successful establishments.
“Why?” I asked.  “It seemed so popular and successful!”
“Yes, yes it sussessful.  Too sussessful I tink.”
I waited for more of an explanation and didn’t have to ask.
“We have Russians,” she said softly, looking to both sides with her eyes as though what she said were taboo.  “Russians want to take business.”  She lightly bit her lower lip indicating to me that she was serious.
“So how do they just take a business?”
Her eyes darted around again, and then she said, “Assurance.  Dey want us buy assurance.”
She needed to say no more.  I lived in Brooklyn for a few years, long enough to know how “insurance” extortion worked with small mom and pop style businesses.  So now the Russians in Thailand are adapting the techniques of Italians in Brooklyn.  That would be called diversity.  Nice world we live in.
“Did this just come up?” I asked.  “Just eight months ago when I visited, you all seemed so secure and successful.  I couldn’t imagine you would ever even have problems like this in Thailand.”
“No, not den.  Dis just come up.”
It was evident she didn’t want to talk about it at the moment so we agreed to let it go until I got there.  But it stood to reason that as she gets involved with me, trouble would come up.  It finds me.  I should have warned her.  So we changed the subject and soon said goodbye with my promise that I’d call her from Narita, assuming I survived the eighteen-hour leg before that.
Boarding was announced and I ended up waiting in line right in front of a TV monitor with CNN droning on about gun control laws.  I had no dog in that fight as I never even held a gun in my hand, much less wanted one.  But they didn’t scare me either.  The guy next to me didn’t feel quite the same.”
“Idiots!” he exclaimed, but he used another word.  “If everybody that you see right here all carried a gun, no shooter would dare try anything.  If people in that church were armed, it would have never happened.” 
Since he was yelling the statement directly at me and kept staring while he waited for an answer, it seemed that I should respond.
“I don’t know,” I softly replied, hoping to diffuse the situation a bit, “it might work on one level.”  I thought that was neutral enough.
He looked at me in disgust.  “One level?  What do you mean?  There’s only one level and that’s to arm everyone.”  I had no doubts that he had thought this through very thoroughly and he knew he was right.  His stare at me seemed to be getting more intense as I could see dribble forming at the corners of his mouth.  I thought I better play along.
“Well,” I said, pausing like if I was thinking this through myself, “if arming everyone works, and we’ll never know until we do it, then why wouldn’t the same thing work if we gave every sovereign nation out there nuclear capability?  We’d finally have world peace!”
I think a brain cramp was forming as his forehead kind of twisted into a knot.  He looked at me strange and turned away muttering something like, “Well, that’s a different level.”
Didn’t I just say that?
___________________________
On board, I was just putting my phone into airplane mode when I saw that I got another text from Doug.  I read it.
“Absolutely no evidence found yet.  Simple clue left by victim scribbled, “h”, “e” in blood.  Big shot says it means nothing.”
Well, that gave me something to ponder for the next twenty-four hours.  Ponder on nothing.
__________________________
Rubbish, thought Special Agent Kelly.  By now it was going on the second day since the shooting and not a single piece of evidence could be claimed. No clues left at all, no tracks that were traceable, no fibers left, plenty of fingerprints but all probably useless as they would belong to the church members.  There were no witnesses, no nothing.  The security cameras were shot to pieces, one completely obliterated and the other yielding a small section of digital file for all the good it offered.  A blurred and pixelated image of what appeared to be a man, no surprise there, wearing a Red Sox cap and hidden behind a big mustache was all that could be made out. The old church had stood in a fairly isolated area with the next closest security cameras hundreds of yards away.  Best they can do is study the traffic from these cameras and try to identify vehicles that had passed in and out during the approximate time window.  Hardly worth holding ones breath over.
Washington was demanding more and the press was unbelievable in their sarcastic coverage.  The public was getting restless, beginning to spew sharp jabs in social media.  The Boston bombers were detected in a day, the San Bernardino shooters in just a few hours.  Other terrorists went down in flames almost immediately, often as a holy sacrifice in their minds, but there was nothing here that pointed to martyrdom.  This shooter seemed to have gotten away clean, leaving no clues.  It was well planned and the shooter had no intention of getting caught or making a public statement.  He was no martyr.
With the victims all identified and most next of kin notified, each next of kin would unfortunately become Persons Of Interest, P.O.I.’s.  Especially spouses.  But even that seemed far-fetched.  While they wouldn’t be told they were “persons of interest”, each would have their personal lives invaded and examined in an effort to uncover any motive at all that might tie them to this massacre.  The one’s who were loved the most by the victims, and hurt the most by this slaughter, become the first to be suspected.  That’s the world we live in.
____________________________
Passing by the many gates in Narita Airport, legs feeling like rubber after eighteen hours crammed in an economy seat, it was refreshing to see the TV monitors showing something other than CNN, but being that they were all speaking Japanese didn’t help me a bit.  Although they were covering other events, there was a sudden change of scene and I was surprised to see the shooting being covered here in Japan.  That was my hometown on the screen!  Was I supposed to be proud?
I stopped to take in the scene.  How often do you get to see your hometown on the news in Japan?  They were focusing on a man that I had never seen and then, in English, the sub-title appeared, “James Kelly – FBI”.  So I could put a face to the name now.  He looked not happy.  Whatever it was he was saying, the English had been faded out and the Japanese reporter was talking over him, so I couldn’t make it out, but I’m sure he wasn’t praising Doug or any of the local Police for doing such a good job in responding and securing the scene.  He didn’t look the type to do that.
Soon the camera switched off of Kelly and some overall shots of the church and grounds were on display.  Nothing inside was shown as it was obviously cordoned off.  Then there was an aerial view from a drone, starting fairly low but encompassing the entire perimeter of the church property.  I found it interesting.  As congested as the Grand Strand had become in recent years, home developments containing hundreds of units each, often barely twenty feet away from each other, here this old church stood isolated on a seemingly deserted road and snuggled in among thick trees and bushes.  Except for the parking lot and a small break in the trees for it’s entrance, there was all the cover a shooter would need.
The drone then began a slow climb, panning out on the entire area.  As the shoreline came into view, less than a quarter of a mile from the church, one got the flavor of the area, at least in a nostalgic way, of how Myrtle Beach was just a few decades ago.  The scene would stay with me for the days to come.
But I had a flight to connect with and needed to Line Niralyn.  I hurried to my gate as the line to board was just building.  With no time for my laptop, I took out my phone, took it off airplane mode and Line’d her.
“Kup-kum-ka,” her pretty face said.  That’s Thai for hi.
“Kup-kum-kup,” I said.  That’s also Thai for hi, but from a man.  Very polite.
She was obviously happy for me to connect, but already I was able to read her and I knew something wasn’t right.  I was about to probe but didn’t have to.
“Oh, Yo.  Someting bad happen.”  She paused and I just stared, fearful her mother may have been hurt or worse.  Then she continued, “The window boke.  Big, big window in front store.  They boke… boom, it last night!”

Dedication
A
S I COMPLETE this retrospective of my adventure through life, and reflect on how deeply thankful I am for the opportunity to have experienced so many of its dimensions and to have learned so much, I have carefully considered whether there was any one human being whose contribution was so primal that it made everything possible for me. There is, in fact, one such person who deeply touched my life, or, I should say, made my life possible. That person is my maternal grandfather, Abraham Goruch. He was a highly respected family leader, to be sure, though he otherwise walked humbly through his life. But one fateful day in 1911, on his inhospitable home soil of Russia, he performed an extraordinary act of personal bravery in the face of a marauding Cossack band that threatened both him and the lives of his family. As recounted in the pages that follow, he instinctively, courageously, and selflessly rose to confront that fearful and imminent danger and, at great risk to himself, succeeded in protecting them from harm. In so doing, my grandfather changed the lives of his family and its descendants forever. That included my mother, then 10 years old, and, in turn, me. It is not that his brave act changed the quality of my life; it made my life possible. So in dedicating this book to him, I proudly and gratefully honor my grandfather who, in the most profound way, gave me both the gift of life itself and the inspiration to endeavor without surcease to put it to some useful purpose.
Acknowledgments
G
RATITUDE WITH A FULL HEART is first extended to my wife, Dorian, whose love, encouragement, and forbearance during the writing of this memoir never faltered. And to my talented nephew, Dean Schramm, a Hollywood literary agent and producer, learned in the writing and publishing arts, I shall always be grateful for wise counsel and unwavering encouragement. Paul Edwards, my Kansas City campaign manager and later, an author with his wife Sarah of 17 books, was enormously helpful with suggestions, edits, and contacts. I extend special thanks, also, to my publishers at New Insights Press, especially to managing editor Rick Benzel for his many editing improvements and for leading me through the publishing maze, and to art director Susan Shankin for her brilliant cover design and book layout. I am blessed with a large group of friends, many talented writers themselves, who, with care not to hurt my feelings too much, offered thoughtful and very helpful edits to the manuscript. I list them here (alphabetically) with heartfelt gratitude: Hilary Claggett, Wynne Cougill, Cliff Johnson (my Middle East motorcycle partner), Sheldon Novick (a biographer of note), Lonnie Shalton, Judith Slaughter, and Mary Allen Wilkes. And there were so many others, beloved family as well as friends around the world, who encouraged me to write it all down. They include a unique group of Missouri legislative friends, many named in the book, who, during our tenure, took the name, ROSD—or Royal Order of Shit Disturbers, which says it all. We still meet annually. The camaraderie is delicious.
Prologue
A
WORD ABOUT HOW this book came to be: As I moved through the winter of my professional life, I began to think that I might have at least one book in me. But I wasn’t thinking about any kind of memoir at all. I liked public policy and was kind of wonky about it; in fact, as I thought about a book, I thought that maybe I could organize one around a series of essays on the great issues of the day. The topics that came to mind included climate change, Israel-Palestine, the Electoral College, immigration reform, wherefore the United Nations, unbundling Islamic teachings, and the like. Plenty of stuff out there that excites peoples’ curiosity. But that’s as far as I got. I couldn’t get the project under way because I kept saying to myself, “Who cares what I think about these issues? There are lots of scholarly treatises about them.”
Word got around to my friends and colleagues about my writing project, and, assuming it was a memoir, they peppered me with questions about it. “Will you talk about your assignments to Iraq and living in Saddam’s palace and getting bitten by rats?” Or, “Will you reveal that your first marriage was in Tangier, Morocco after a shipboard romance?” Or, “Can you work in why those Pennsylvania legislative leaders complained about you to the White House?” Or, “You won’t omit that paratroop outing when your ‘chute finally decided to open at tree-top level?” Or, “Please tell everyone about how your Missouri legislative cabal, your Royal Order of Shit Disturbers, your ROSD—how they got that name!” Or, “I loved your motorcycle adventure from Baghdad through the Middle East; it will be great to finally get the whole story.” Or, “Tell us, are we still waiting, or did China ever implement your environmental recommendations?” Or, “It will be sad but memorable to recall that election night in ’72 when we waited for the returns to come in on your lieutenant governor’s race!” And on and on it went. My friends were all very excited to read about my political episodes, consulting on four continents, and personal adventures. Their enthusiasm was marvelous, and they assumed I would definitely write about my own life. But—again—that’s not where my head was. I had my doubts. Who, besides family and friends, would be interested?
Informal remarks on my life in governance at the 50th Reunion of our Washington University Law School class
Unless, I thought one day, I could use my experiences to impart something useful to a general audience, but especially those interested in politics and perhaps having a lengthy career, as mine has been, in government. Then, as I was pondering that question, I had something of an epiphany. It was staring me right in the face. My whole life had been devoted to governance in one form or another, whether executing it as an elected and appointed official or as a consultant in so many places around the world—if I could make governance my central theme, maybe it would work. And so the plan for this book began to take shape.
I could talk about my bumpy political journey and the governance insights I gleaned from my experiences at the state, federal, and international levels—and perhaps, I speculated, others would benefit from those insights as well. My life experience, as I stopped to think about it, was very broad and the stories at each level were rich in political intrigue, power trips, and, especially as to the international work, an insider’s look into what was happening behind the headlines. I could sketch out my early years and what forces formed my thoughts about government and contributing to better the world.
Though my school friends and I considered ourselves as American as apple pie, we were all first generation Americans, and we saw this country through the eyes of our ever-grateful parents and their friends. The influences were subtle but quite real, as were others in those formative years. When I went away to college, and later, I began to see differences in my peers—in our upbringing, our values, and our points of view about the world. For example, I never heard a negative word about President Franklin Roosevelt until I was a sophomore in college! He was practically worshipped by the adults in my early life. Those early years were when my values took shape—and my naiveté and sensitivities were challenged—and they became key to the directions I took in my later professional life. I had an adventure streak a mile wide and a curiosity about the unknown, what life was about beyond my neighborhood and schools. I explored, reached out and touched things I had experienced only in books. My military experience and my worldwide travel—I didn’t want to do what, or go where, everybody else did—taught me a great deal about self-reliance, experimentation . . . and the value of seeking. It was important that I talk about those things in my book as well; they contributed to how I got to be who I am, and why I think as I do. And they became governance values every bit as much as the experiences I had in my neighborhood growing up and during my education. I like to think of it all as context.
So, finally, I had a formula for a book. I was to be a vehicle—constructed uniquely from many parts, to be sure—to provide glimpses into how government worked at many different levels. I had to explain it through the only lens I knew—me. But it wasn’t to be just about me and all of my ego—but what I learned about governance—a distinction very important to me.
Moreover, I didn’t want it to be a textbook, for heaven’s sake. The glimpses and the lessons were simply to accompany my trip through life. They were not to be served up on a silver platter, but to be ingested in a natural flow with each course of my life’s various passages. I was blown off course several times—as have we all.
For me, each new course proved to be not only useful but purposeful. I think I have been fortunate in that regard, though I do believe that it is important that we not give up on trying to make our lives count for something in the larger scheme of things. If that comes through in this book, I would be proud to be the messenger, and maybe that’s lesson enough. I hope you will bear with me as I move through some of the substantive issues I encountered in my journey. I have tried not to be too technical or legalistic about those things, but I wanted to serve up some of the flavor of the work I did, both domestically and internationally, and I trust I have found a proper balance and not been too off-putting. I hope that there is something to be learned from the experiences I have had—about governance and other things. But you be the judge.
PART 1
VALUES AND THE FORMATIVE YEARS
ONE
First Generation Life in America
M
Y WORLD BEGAN at 1:45 a.m. on Thursday, January 21, 1932 at the Missouri Baptist Hospital in St. Louis—an Aquarian, as astrology would hold, who would see the world as one closely-related human family and would paint in broad strokes. And because I landed on the cusp of Capricorn, the stars further predicted that I was to be given strength of purpose and the fortitude to move my objectives forward. Both would later prove to be my strongest inner instincts, though, I also found, they were no guarantor of success.
I was the third of four sons, and we were born in couplets. The elder pair, Marvin and Norman (in that order), were born in the 1920s with their names reflecting a more traditional world. Seven years elapsed before I came along, followed 21 months later by brother Paul, our names reflecting perhaps a tilt toward modernity. Marv and Norman, perceived by us in those early years as much older, went off to serve in the armed forces during World War II. Paul and I, closer in age, shared more of life’s experiences. We were first generation Americans. I had no idea that this was a significant demographic until decades later. We were American as apple pie, strongly patriotic—and poor. We were, after all, in the middle of the Great Depression. But that characteristic was common to everyone we knew. My mother’s maiden name was Frieda Sylvia Goruch. Born in 1901, she was second eldest of four daughters and a son, born to Abraham and Rebecca Goruch (or Goruchovsky before it was anglicized). She lived in a shtetl just outside of Kiev in what is now Ukraine, but was then under Russian rule. Jews weren’t allowed to live within the boundaries of Kiev proper. She used to tell us that the floor of their home was bare earth. Everyone had a trade in the shtetls of the time, and my maternal grandfather (born in 1875) made his living as a tailor.
Pogroms were deadly and feared by the shtetl populations of Eastern Europe during those terrible years, particularly from 1880 through 1914 when anti-Semitism raged throughout the Russian Empire. It seemed that much of the blame for all the troubles of society was laid at the feet of the already ostracized Jews, and it would only get worse unless they found a way out of there. Ukrainian Russia, where my family lived, was somehow a particular hotbed for government-sanctioned pogroms, though the Czar vehemently denied any role on his part.
One fateful day in 1911 my mother’s settlement was attacked by marauding Russian Cossacks on horseback, one swooping in to assault my grandfather, then 33, and his family. Putting his family behind him, my grandfather ran forward to intercept the rider and threw him from his horse. Since resistance was not tolerated, my grandfather had to leave his family following the altercation and flee for his life! With the parting words, “I will get you out!” he made his way to Hamburg where he hid in a lifeboat on an ocean liner bound for New Orleans. Once there, he slipped off the ship and managed to follow the Mississippi River north up to St. Louis where other immigrants he knew had settled, including (helpfully) his father, who had peacefully, to use the word loosely, emigrated there in January 1909.
There were, of course, many other European immigrant groups in that era who were escaping from very difficult circumstances, but few who feared daily for their very safety as did the Jews of the time. In the case of my grandfather, it’s accurate to say that he was one of America’s early undocumented aliens. The memory of his story is seared into my conscience and unceasingly reminds me of my own personal commitment to supporting a proper solution to a significant item of America’s unfinished business—the plight of America’s current crop of undocumented aliens. It should be easily understood that the punishing experience of the Jewish Diaspora over two millennia has forged into the DNA of successive generations of Jews, down to the present one, a sensitivity to the plight of the downtrodden and a yearning for a just society. As events will bear out in this personal account, it is certainly there in mine, as imperfect in its expression as my fettered humanity has allowed. But it is unmistakably there. What America, cloaked in an ever struggling exceptionalism, so importantly adds to the mix is a unique collection of governance values—an exciting infusion of profound democratic community—that offers a realistic hope of perfecting such a society in the fullness of time.
In the old immigrant neighborhoods of St. Louis, my grandfather, resolutely trying to find his way, found an abandoned storefront on 6th Street which, as luck would have it, contained a scrapped sign in the back that read, “Buck the Tailor.” So, with that welcoming token bestowed no doubt by his guardian angels (whose work was pretty good so far), my brave and embattled grandfather became Buck the Tailor! He saved his nickels and dimes for two years at the trade he knew, and then sent for his family who had been holding their own with the help of friends and extended family on the outskirts of Kiev.
My grandmother’s family, and her sister’s family as well, eleven strong (six Goruchovsky’s and five Kranitzky’s) arrived in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on January 13, 1913. The Canadian Pacific Railroad then ushered them down to Detroit where they were admitted into the United States, finally, feeling absolutely incredulous over what was happening in their lives. Immigration officials, as they did with so many of the European unpronounceables, shortened my grandmother’s name from Goruchovsky to Goruch and her sister’s name from Kranitzky to Crane. They then traveled overland to St. Louis—my mother was 12—where they had a joyous reunion with my grandfather who, then, impatiently escorted them to his tailor shop where they would live for a time. It had a wooden floor! Happily re-unified, the family continued its struggle for survival, but at least in freedom in this new world of theirs—no small consideration if one stops to think about it, and, as I came to believe, one that we take for granted at our peril.
Many decades later, I had a consulting assignment in Kiev. Our threesome hailed a taxi and went to visit the Babi Yar Memorial, a ravine on the outskirts of the city. It was there that the Nazis, in their war against the Soviet Union, rounded up all the Jews in the Kiev region for what they said was transportation to another holding area. Then they were told to dig further into the ravine. Over the next two days, September 29th and 30th 1941, in a ruthless operation, Nazi Sonderkommandos murdered all 33,771 Jews who were gathered there—men, women, and children. It was one of the largest single massacres in the history of the Holocaust. Other later victims at the site included thousands of Soviet POWs, communists, Gypsies, Ukrainian nationalists, and civilian hostages. Estimates are that 100,000 to 150,000 lives were taken in that ravine.
I stood there looking at it, next to the memorial, in utter disbelief, trying to conjure up the abject terror that had been experienced there and which has become a bitter lesson in the failures of humanity. I was gripped by a realization, known casually as just family history before, but shockingly thrust into my consciousness in that moment: My mother and her family would have been totally wiped out in 1941 in that ravine had my grandfather not escaped himself and sent for them 28 years earlier. Maybe my father’s family as well. We knew the stories, but standing there right in the middle of the reality of it all was overwhelming. Why do some live and some die? It reinforced my deeply felt curiosity about such bewildering issues which had plagued me for years . . . and still do.
My father, Benjamin Jacob Schramm, was born in 1899 in Volhynia Gaberna, located maybe 175 miles west of Kiev in the northwest sector of present-day Ukraine. In alternating periods of time a part of Poland, Prussia, Austria, or Russia, it belonged to the Russian Empire when my father came onto the scene.
Second eldest of four children, my father was the only boy. The anglicized names of his parents were Frank and Ida Schramm. My paternal grandfather was born about 1870 and was a Talmud teacher and scholar. Interestingly, the name Schramm is a fairly common German name. German emigration to Volhynia Gaberna, mostly from Poland but also from some German provinces, grew to a population estimated at some 200,000 by the turn of the century. So somewhere down the line, my father’s forbears took on the same name of their Christian German neighbors—probably their landowners, in much the same way, I would guess, an African American bore the name of his ancestors’ slave owners. But conditions of the Volhynian Germans began to deteriorate in the late 19th century and thousand began to emigrate to both the United States and Canada.
My paternal grandfather, like so many of his Volhynian German neighbors, took his family and emigrated to America in 1905, and made their way to St. Louis also. My father was just six. Once in St. Louis, my grandparents on both sides, still unknown to one another, settled into life—the Goruches (my grandfather finally succumbed to the practicalities of this shortened version) on Carr Street and the Schramms in a nearby neighborhood—in what is now downtown St. Louis. This is the area where most of the Eastern European immigrants gathered. Some called it a Jewish ghetto, not unlike the living habits that had been forced upon them for centuries in the shtetls of the Eastern European diaspora. It was a mutual protection and comfort thing.
My father was a good student, especially in math, and made it through the eighth grade. My mother went through the fifth grade, and left school to help out at home. A love of music, and an aptitude for its expression led my father to violin lessons. He developed a real flair for technique but his passion was especially evident as he pursed his lips and leaned forward, his body and bow arm in rhythmic synchronicity, surging from dulcet to brio on both instrument and brow, as he transited the emotional phrasing in a sweeping melody of Tchaikovsky or Beethoven. My father was in charge and ecstatic when he was doing his music—his thing. It showed on his face. It was good to see, as he didn’t have that kind of happiness—in a protracted sense—as the years wore on.
The early years were better and more promising. It was inevitable that my father would become a professional musician—and an accomplished one. Professional opportunities began to come, and he found himself organizing and leading small groups of musicians for weddings and other functions.
As he broke into his twenties, buoyed by his music and feeling lighthearted, he was emboldened to turn to matters of the heart. He met Frieda Goruch, a beautiful young girl with a pug nose and regular Slavic-like features. She agreed to accompany him on some of his playing engagements, sitting off to the side and proudly watching her boyfriend entertain all those strangers. It was kind of exciting for them both. Unable to deny their love for each other, they married in 1920—he was 21 and she 19. Thus began the tumultuous life of Ben and Frieda Schramm.
Marvin arrived in 1922 and Norman in 1924. The Roaring 20’s was a time of opportunity for musicians, perhaps the most successful time of my father’s life, as he was engaged to play dinner music at the (still) fashionable Chase Hotel. A large black sign with silver glitter letters reading “Ben Schramm and his Orchestra” hung over the stage—and he kept that sign for all the ensuing decades of his life in a closet wherever he lived.
In 1927, and feeling ready, my parents emigrated from the City of St. Louis to the County of St. Louis (two different jurisdictions). They wanted to be where the rest of the Jewish community was moving—into the adjoining suburb of University City (so named because it abutted Washington University in St. Louis and many of its streets were named for universities: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, Tulane, Colgate, Dartmouth, the more prominent ones). The family lived in three apartments over the next nine years. The stock market crashed in 1929 and the depression had engulfed everyone.
My father’s music business crashed, too. He tried to open up a dry cleaning business, but he refused to pay protection to the mob—so they threw a bomb through his window and that ended that. My mother thought she had to do something to earn some money, so she bought some hosiery and underwear at discount prices and then sold them to the employees at several hotels who agreed to the purchases if they could pay for them a little each week. So she marked up the articles and sold them at a profit. She began regular collections for these sales. And her business grew to include furniture and appliances and a retail store owner backed her with merchandise.
Her customers were all in the black community, and this kind of arrangement was the only way they could afford those necessities. She was trailblazing, one could argue, the credit card economy we have today. She didn’t know it, but she also had started the feminist movement.
As my mother was getting underway in her business, we moved to our fourth apartment in 1936. I was four. All of these apartments were located in an area called the Delmar Loop, so named because it was the streetcar turnaround for the westernmost reach of the then ‘mass transit’ system of St. Louis. Our new apartment was a third floor walkup at 6319 Delmar Boulevard, right on the main drag. The Loop was U. City’s business district and stretched for about eight blocks beyond the city line.
At the far end of the business district was Delmar-Harvard Grade School (at the corner of Delmar and Harvard Avenue), where brother Paul and I attended grade school. My political career started in kindergarten where my teachers (Miss Olmstead and Miss Iseley—I’ll never forget them) appointed me the fire chief of a red fire wagon that we had built. I remember being surprised. From humble beginnings and all that . . . .
Times were still tough for everyone in the Loop. FDR and the federal government created the Works Progress Administration (or WPA as it was popularly known) in 1935 to preserve the skills and self-respect of the working people of America. It lasted until 1943. They did everything—from infrastructure to the arts. It included the creation of the WPA symphony orchestra that played every week in University City’s Heman Park. My father signed up as a violinist, as did many of his musician friends. We frequently went to listen to the orchestra on a summer evening. My father earned about $90.00 a month, which helped with the rent, while my mother earned the grocery money.
We lived in that Delmar apartment all the way through my first year of law school. It was home. Early on, my mother’s credit business attracted other entrants—all men. About a dozen of them banded together, along with my mother (the only woman), to pool their purchasing power so that they could buy their merchandise at favorable prices. Mom held her own with the men—and her boys were proud of her, though we didn’t quite realize how extraordinary she was. The family members—all of us—just forged ahead with our lives. And enjoyed the dinners she cooked for us every evening, which we just took for granted.
My father never seemed to be able to get a toehold in business, and tried several ventures into the 1940’s. He was an artist, not a businessman, and seemed very unhappy most of the time. He was able to join several community orchestras, the first in University City and the second in Kirkwood (another suburb), and I truly think those were lifesavers for him.
One day when I was about 10, I got a look at life in the raw. My mother hired one of her customers, Margaret, to clean the house once a week to pick up the slack for her. Margaret was like one of the family. On a warm sunny day, Margaret asked if I would like a root beer—a real treat because I knew it meant going down the street to visit Blondie & Dick’s Root Beer Stand, an outdoor arrangement vividly painted in orange and black, and extremely popular in the Loop. We were seated at the bar and there were no other customers. Margaret paid for a large mug and I chugged most of it down but couldn’t finish it, so I passed it over to Margaret and asked her to finish it for me. She smiled, put the mug to her lips, and no sooner had she done that, when Blondie appeared—she startled me—and snatched the mug right out of Margaret’s hands, saying, “Sorry!”
I was only a little guy, but I was dumbstruck! I knew what had happened but could hardly believe it. Margaret was denied service by Blondie because, and only because, she was black (“African American” wasn’t in vogue yet). Margaret was hurt. I could tell it, but she held onto her dignity. I hurt, too, for Margaret, and was so very embarrassed. It just wasn’t right, I remembered thinking. We walked home in silence, but that scene remained with me throughout my life, and has informed my conscience on matters of race whenever it was in my power to do something about it. I didn’t yet know what politics was about but I believe we all face character-building moments, as this one was for me, and we either experience some kind of propulsion within us that directs us to want to make change, or we don’t. Whoever is in charge of imprinting consciences found an easy mark in me.
Little by little I began to develop a notion about how people should treat one another. I was a bit shy and serious—but proud. Not flashy or show-offy proud. But I wanted to be upstanding and didn’t want to be criticized for not doing the right thing. I then had a personal experience as a youngster that challenged my self-righteousness, if I can call it that. Every Jewish kid in my generation experienced prejudice at one time or another. Every one.
On one occasion, I was forced into a physical fight—the only one I ever had. I was only about 11. About five neighbor kids, including my brother Paul and me, went over to have some fun at an abandoned construction site nearby. We weren’t there five minutes when five older boys suddenly appeared; they were from nearby Christ the King parochial school, who were notorious for seeking out “Jew-boy Christ-killers” and beating them up. They let it be known that we were their targets. Our little group fled wildly down the hill—except me. I was too proud to run, though I don’t know what came over me. I just stood there frozen to the ground. Brother Paul was frantically calling to me to run.
The bullies selected one of their number to do the honors. Meanwhile, Paul and the other kids ran home and screamed at my brother Norman (who was 17 or 18) ‘to come rescue Jack who was getting beaten up.’ Norm rushed back with the other kids, and we were still grappling. But Norman was the equalizer and, for the sake of everyone’s pride, I guess it was, wisely asked if we wanted to fight it out, and we both nodded yes, almost automatically. To tell the truth, I wasn’t so sure. But, knowing it would now be a fair fight, and the others wouldn’t pile on, I was energized and became very aggressive, slugging the guy. After a bit, I yelled, “Tell me when you’ve had enough!” And he finally did. The bullies made a fast exit, and I remember the triumphant walk home, Norman, with his arm around my shoulder, beaming down at his little brother.
The ferocity of anti-Semitism has moderated with the passing of each generation—from the shtetls and Holocaust of my grandparents’ and parents’ time, to the present where it is certainly the case that our children have been less exposed to this mindless hatred. But it’s still out there, perhaps worse in the subtler (and sometimes not so subtle) expressions of racial bias experienced by African Americans. And today the LGBT community and Latinos are experiencing some of the same kinds of senseless hatred that stands in the way of love and acceptance of our fellow human beings. Although, over time, we assuredly have done better, we should hope that the trajectory improves.
So, if one is born into a cauldron of “them” and “us,” attitudes are shaped. Certainly mine were shaped—as one of “them”—by personally witnessing and experiencing, even at a tender age, the callousness of hatred, the damage it inflicts, and the sorrow it leaves behind. I cannot square it with any concept of cosmic morality that I have encountered. Others may be born into, and come to identify with a culture of “us vs. them.” It must be very difficult to wrest one’s mind from this kind of negativity and the divisiveness that those influences tend to weave into one’s DNA. The struggle between these two forces has been played out in America since our beginnings as we try to “form a more perfect union.” I happen to believe that the expansion of personal liberties will continue, but those of like mind will need to persevere to make it happen.
Nowadays the “other side,” to put it gently, is more sophisticated in its discrimination. It couches its lack of concern for “them” in the polemics of such phantoms as fear of takeover (reflected in restrictive immigration policy and absence of gun control), fear of abuse (reflected in hobbled voting rights ), Biblical injunction (reflected in restraints on LGBT rights, women’s rights), big government intrusiveness (reflected in seeking an unshackling from economic, environmental, and all manner of regulation), and constitutional exhortation (using the Constitution to restrict rather than enlarge rights—such as using the 10th Amendment ‘powers reserved to the states’ clause to de-fang Federal jurisdiction or the 14th Amendment ‘due process’ clause to undo abortion rights).
TWO
Political Nascence: The Fledgling Years
S
EVERAL YEARS AGO when I joined my classmates in St. Louis for the 50th reunion of our graduation from the Washington University School of Law, we were asked to explain the circumstances surrounding our decision to study law and what our legal careers were all about. When my turn came, I said I had wanted to become a lawyer since the age of 12, but that my principal motivation was not so much to practice but rather to make law. I didn’t know where that came from, I joked, unless I had been in the Roman Senate in a previous life. The way politics gripped my life throughout my school years, and ineluctably directed me toward politics later, has made me wonder where in the world that inner drive and motivation truly came from.
Even in my neighborhood growing up, and still in grade school, I seemed to have had a penchant for organizing things. It wasn’t anything special, and I didn’t attach any significance to it. I suggested stuff and the kids just followed along. For example, I organized a “Bike Patrol,” looking for I don’t know what, evil-doers, I suppose. Also an “army” of 12 young stalwarts—and I was the general, of course. This was during World War II and we even did hikes as training maneuvers and “played guns.” The NRA would have been proud! Probably the most fun was the cork ball league I organized where St. Louis kids (it’s the only place it’s played) learned to hit lightning fast balls and curves, thrown with a tennis ball, with a sawed-off broomstick. And that morphed into a fast pitch baseball team that I organized to play against other neighborhood teams, all before we were in high school. We used to create our own amusements as there were no professional youth organizers or clubs in the 1940s.
My 7th to 9th grade happened at Ward Junior High School. As we reached the end of the 8th grade and the election of next year’s student council president loomed, I found myself a candidate, at the behest of some friends. It was 1945 and the world was consumed by the prospect of World War II coming to an end. The surrender of Germany and Japan (the latter prompted by the use of atomic weapons) was only a few months off. So in my speech to the student body, I spoke of the scourge of war and how we had to be steadfast in the face of its challenges. Never mind what I would do for the school, if elected. I was only 13, had just been bar mitzvahed a few months earlier and obviously had taken the Hebrew injunction of Tikun Olam (Repair the World) perhaps too seriously, for this election anyway. But so it would be for the rest of my life. Well, I won the election (my first), and I was teasingly reminded of that speech by classmates as many as 30 years later! In this, I learned that if you can’t do relevance, memorable is good!
The next phase of my busy life took place at University City Senior High School. From ages 15 through 17, everything was new and wonderful, and included sports, fraternities, dating, and school politics, too. Sports, especially, consumed me. I was good at baseball and lettered in all three of my high school years. I also played American Legion baseball and in summer industrial leagues—with and against players who went to the major leagues.
Then there were clubs, the school newspaper, and, of course, the student council. My home room class elected me to the student council in the 10th grade. I worked hard in my studies and became a self-starter as I knew help from home was unlikely. Academically, I was above average and finally made the honor roll in my last couple of semesters. Grades were truly earned in those days the hard way.
The end of the 11th grade came and, with it, campaign time for the office of student body president for our senior year. Or, to be more precise, for the first half of our senior year; the school administration thought it best to share this school honor between two students, one for each semester. Again, friends urged me to run. I would never have run without their encouragement, as my shy self would have thought it too presumptuous to run otherwise. Election day came and we gave our speeches. I don’t remember what I said, but I won (or maybe my campaign manager, Chuck Walker, won; he gave a very entertaining speech). So, on this one, I learned that if you can’t do substance, entertainment is good!
Senior year came, and it was an exciting one. Presiding over the student council and its work, chair of the Junior-Senior Prom Committee, I was also selected (I don’t remember how) to be Mayor of University City for a Day. I continued to take everything seriously. One day, Miss Briscoe, our student council faculty sponsor, gently nudged me not to overdo it by saying, “Jack, I heard one girl say that she would love it if you would just smile!” Notwithstanding, in the final tallies for senior class ‘most this and that,’ Dick Dutton, student body president in the second semester, and I tied as “Most Popular Boy.” So maybe it was okay to be serious-minded!
Of course, during senior year, the thoughts of almost all of my classmates turned to college—where would we go? U. City High School had developed a sterling reputation in the university community as among the best high schools in St. Louis County—and there were dozens. About 90% of its graduates went on to college. Everyone was expected to. Most of us were first generation Americans and “People of the Book,” and we knew that education was a path to the American dream. It was 1949. The Great Depression and World War II both had ended, and I instinctively felt that education would help me accomplish things that were beginning to stir deeply within me. For those of us living in the Delmar Loop especially, we couldn’t wait to get started.
Since Princeton and Harvard took our academic stars, it was hard for me not to dream, too, about going to an Eastern college. My family certainly could not afford it. So while I was awaiting some celestial guidance, the admissions dean from Colgate University in Hamilton, New York decided to visit our high school for the first time, based on our reputation. I attended—and was hooked by pictures of the beautiful campus in a small town, an all-male student body of only 1,300, the core curriculum of philosophy and religion, public affairs, the study of an alternative culture, but mostly by the prospect of joining the Washington Study Group for a semester of studying the federal government right there in its offices. Though it was late in the season, I sent for an application and, shortly thereafter, was contacted by Tom DePew, Colgate’s college advisor for St. Louis. We hit it off famously. A successful businessman, Tom always wanted to help deserving people, often saying to me throughout the course of a lifelong friendship, “We’ve got to help them, Jack!” I didn’t realize at the time that I was one of his early projects. He proved to be one of the most decent people I have ever known.
I needed a scholarship and Tom went to bat for me to be sure I received one. What I didn’t know until well after I had graduated was that I had applied too late for financial aid for my freshman year, and that Tom had arranged with the school to pay for my freshman year himself. He really wanted me to go to Colgate! (I have since established a scholarship at Colgate as a way of repaying Tom’s poignant and indelible kindness.) My record after my first year persuaded Colgate, going forward, to cover my annual tuition and provide work in the library and dining facilities to defray room and board. This amounted to two-thirds of the cost of attending, or $1,600.00 per year. My parents footed the remaining third, or $800.00. How things have changed, as fellow parents will attest!
My freshman year at Colgate was exciting. I made lots of friends, pledged Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, one of the more popular ones, and in contravention of its ‘only for Christians’ clause. Again, I was asked to run for freshman class president by friends. As I recall, my speech was about how all of us should receive invitations to the fraternities, as Princeton had done for its eating clubs, because those who were left out (about 15% of the class) truly missed an important social dimension offered by the college. The idea was that if one was good enough to be admitted to the college, he was good enough to be admitted to a fraternity. I won the election. It was then that I knew I would be elected Student Senate president for my senior year. And that’s what happened. It was a strange feeling because it was almost as if I could will my success in these elections. My arrogance would get its comeuppance as time went on, but I was feeling my oats at the time.
My life at Colgate was truly fulfilling. After the freshman class presidency, my fraternity thought I should represent it in the Student Senate, which served only to whet my appetite for more. “Politics” is the word commonly used to describe this kind of activity, but I didn’t use the term. I thought it was much more like a responsibility that one should exercise on behalf of one’s fellows. I was still possessed of that serious and very idealistic turn of mind. After my sophomore year, I won a scholarship from the Experiment in International Living to spend the summer in Morelia, Mexico living with a Mexican family, where I soaked up the culture and language, and broadened my vistas. With courses in International Law and International Organization, I was really getting turned on to the international scene.
During my junior year, my international affairs professor, Dr. Robert Elder, had me appointed to two inter-collegiate positions that would further excite my interest in international policy. The first was as president of the Upstate New York Model United Nations Security Council, comprised of eleven regional universities, which I found intriguing. The second appointment, somewhat more challenging, was as a Main Committee chair at meetings of the Mid-Atlantic Model United Nations General Assembly being held, of all places, at the United Nations Building in New York City. Well, let me tell you—how could a young person not be impressed by conducting even faux UN business in the ECOSOC Chamber itself!
Apparently I was not so bad at doing presiding officer stuff because, at the close of our three day meetings, and in the session where the participants (representing some 60 colleges and universities from the Mid-Atlantic states) were to select the presiding officers for the following year’s session, I was elected to serve as president of the General Assembly. Again, I thought to myself, what is going on here?
Back at Colgate, at the end of my junior year, I was elected student body president and presided over the Student Senate for the first semester of my senior year, but had to turn the gavel over to the vice president (Vail Taylor, a wonderful and deservedly well-respected guy) in the second semester so I could spend that semester in Washington, D.C. with the Washington Study Group. But I had an insight during a philosophy course with Dr. Holmes Hartshorne during that first semester that has remained with me throughout my political life. Dr. Hartshorne explained the American political experience as a national commitment to the autonomous individual. “Well, what does that mean,” he probed?
“Autonomous,” he explained, “derives from two Greek words: ‘autos’ meaning self and ‘nomos’ meaning reason or order. Thus, the self-reasoning or self-ordered individual.”
Then Dr. Hartshorne went on to apply this fundamental concept to our political parties. “The Republicans,” he explained, “emphasize the ‘autos’ or self and are identified with free private enterprise, the values of liberty, and untrammeled, to the extent possible, individual expression. And, for their part, Democrats emphasize the ‘nomos’ and thus are more identified with the reasonable use of government to achieve order and social welfare, emphasizing the equality of individuals in the process. But each carries the seeds and values of the other so that they both can lay claim to a commitment to the autonomous individual. Thus, while Republicans want to reduce regulation and allow Wall Street and the banks to exercise their financial and business creativity for the benefit of all, they would be hesitant to overturn the ‘nomos’ dimension of the equation as represented by Social Security or perhaps other social measures.”
“And the Democrats,” Dr. Hartshorne continued, “although fully committed to the beneficial uses of government as reflected in the ‘nomos’ dimension of this equation, are at the same time committed to the private enterprise system, liberty, and private expression as reflected in the ‘autos,’ perhaps not as ardently as the Republicans, but it is a strongly shared value nonetheless.”
That little insight, as explained by Dr. Hartshorne, was an epiphany for me, and I have carried those words with me throughout my life. They are a great summary of American political life. To me, they mean that we are a nation of shared values. There is more that unites us than divides us. Our differences are a matter of degree. The American political process of transparency and openly debating our differences is designed to allow us to glimpse what the other guy is thinking, to understand it even if we don’t agree with it, and to work to resolve our differences in a peaceful way. The “autonomous individual”—this way of thinking about who we are—is a notion that encapsulates our common worth and has always brought us together in times of national stress. It has kept me sane.
My final semester in Washington, D.C. was a memorable experience! We were ten students, both seniors and juniors, and, as it happened, split down the middle politically—five Republicans and five Democrats. By this time, I knew that my heart was firmly planted on the Democratic side of the aisle. I was able to sharpen my debating skills as we argued all the time, even on the trolley every morning as we headed up to the Capitol from the YMCA where we stayed. That was my first taste of anyone daring to articulate to my face a difference with the way I saw the world! I was comfortable with my views and initially wondered how in the world they—my classmates—could come to such different conclusions. Didn’t we have the same facts and concerns? Well, needless to say, I got quite an education in public policy from my Republican friends. A shot across my naïve bow! What a politically sheltered life I had led!
It was 1953 and Dwight Eisenhower was president, having defeated Adlai Stevenson—such a refined, intelligent fellow, I remember musing—the year before. The semester was eye-opening at so many levels—from a visit in the White House to interview Ike’s press secretary; to a personal interview with Vice President Richard Nixon; to a period of study in the State Department (as a group) and then the Department of Labor (we each had to choose an agency); and, finally, in connection with our study of Congress, its members, and the legislative process, to some three weeks or so as an intern in our own congressman’s office—mine was Representative Tom Curtis, a Republican representing the greater part of St. Louis County. I remember thinking to myself that, someday, I would run for that selfsame seat—and I did some 23 years later, in 1976. Clearly, by this time, I had an undeniable feeling that politics was to be my calling.
Midway through the semester, Dr. Elder and I took a long weekend off to head to Ithaca, N.Y, where I was to assume my responsibilities as President of the Mid-Atlantic Model UN General Assembly. It was to convene at the Cornell Law School. I worked closely, and also shared a dormitory room, with Peter Kenen, a Columbia University student who had been selected to be the Secretary-General. I addressed him as “Peter” and he addressed me as “Your Excellency.” Peter was brilliant and played his role to the hilt. He later received his doctorate at Harvard and, from 1971 through 2004, was the Walker Professor of Economics and International Finance at Princeton and became internationally renowned.
By that time, I had presided over so many student groups that I remember having felt fairly confident and comfortable in managing the flow of debate and occasionally interceding to push along the resolution of an issue. It was a confidence-builder for me and a very satisfying learning experience. When we were packing up to go home following a crowded few days of international problem-solving with wonderfully creative peers—we all wished that we could have had a real go at these issues—Dr. Elder, with whom I had developed a warm relationship, privately whispered to me, “Jack, when you get into this work for real, don’t forget to contact me for consulting purposes!” Given the knowledge imbalance between my professor and me, that he would suggest that I hire him some day—did I really hear what I heard? Though stunned, I was secretly very pleased with what I was doing to warrant Dr. Elder’s confidence.
Dr. Elder and I returned to the program in Washington, concluded our semester’s work in May, and returned to campus to prepare for graduation for those of us who were seniors. I finished my academics with a deep major in political science and two minors—one in philosophy and one in Spanish, both of which I truly relished. I sat with the political science faculty for the departmental honors exam, a daunting exercise! My GPA put me in the top 10% of my class which qualified me for the honors exam with cum laude standing. It could have been magna but for a few C’s in my first couple of semesters while I was learning how to study at the college level. A leak that a faculty friend coaxed out of several political science faculty colleagues revealed to our collective glee that my oral exam was of high honors caliber. But I was delighted, after all was said and done, to graduate Cum Laude with Honors in Political Science from a place like Colgate; I also felt honored to have been admitted to both the junior and senior honorary societies and to have been awarded a George W. Cobb Fellowship for leadership. More than delighted for a boy from the Delmar Loop.
THREE
The Influences of Law School and Military Service
I
WAS ADMITTED TO the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis where I began my first year of legal studies in the Fall of 1953. I lived at home in the Loop, could walk to classes, and had a scholarship loan from the St. Louis Scholarship Foundation. It was good not to be a further financial burden to my parents, who were busy helping my brother Paul through undergraduate school, and later law school, at the University of Missouri-Columbia, some 120 miles away. To have the credential—a law degree—was an enthralling prospect for me.
What a budding lawyer learns from the very beginning is the necessity of finding the core issue of a problem at the very outset of a dispute, how to express it and be right about it. It is necessary in this kind of analysis to put aside any coloration of the issue, whether based in emotion or philosophy, and see it as it is—the reality of the matter in the bright light of day. Being clear-eyed about a problem’s core issues and dimensions is the sine qua non to its satisfactory resolution. Resorting to morality and philosophy are fine when addressing the resolution question, but it is imperative to be realistic about the fundamental problem you are faced with.
I have always felt that the study of the law was an excellent preparation for a career in politics or in the development or execution of public policy. To be sure, one can learn to be an effective public practitioner through other professional disciplines, but, at least in my opinion, the best preparation for a socio-legal gap analysis and the application of an apt legislative solution is legal training. I hasten to add, however, that I think it would be a mistake to have a legislative body solely comprised of lawyers. A policy-making body benefits from a wide range of life experiences. For me and my inclinations though, I was satisfied that legal training would best equip me for public policy analysis and leadership.
We learned all about research methods and how to use the library in that first year. We didn’t have computers then and no access to lightning fast answers to majority and minority rules in any given jurisdiction. Instead we plowed through the books, took copious notes on what we found, painstakingly “shepardized” our cases, as we called it, to ensure that their holdings had not been later overruled or amended, and then laboriously hunt-and-pecked on our old typewriters to complete our research papers.
Well into my second semester, I started to think hard about the final two years of law school, and especially about the prospect of piling up further debt through the scholarship loan, which was still available to me. The GI Bill was another option open to me but only for a few more months since the Korean War was in the process of officially winding down in 1954. I decided to go for it. I kept my own counsel in this process, as I did for most things—master of my own fate kind of thing. This was characteristic of all of my collegiate decision-making, and truly felt throughout my life that I was the one, the only one, really in charge of my destiny. Not to be too dramatic about it, but I felt that I was the one to take my fate—my own fate—into my own hands, that no one could do for me what I was supposed to do for myself.
Truth be told, I had something of an adventurous streak within me. It was related to my natural curiosity and extended to unknown things, places, and experiences, sort of a fascination with things beyond my ken. This curiosity about the unknown later led me to spiritual places that helped me come to terms with my place in the world, and to accept both my disappointments and successes with equanimity—a sense of balance and calm.
In that broader connection, I always both admired and envied my genius nephew, David Schramm (a 6’4” red-headed giant of a man and eldest son of brother Marvin), who was short-listed for a Nobel in astrophysics before his untimely accidental death in 1997 at the age of 52, flying his own plane (having picked up the love of flying airplanes from his father). A physical as well as an intellectual adventurer, Dave climbed mountains on every continent, except Antarctica, despite having several near-death experiences. He learned the rough and tumble side of life as an all-state wrestler as a Missouri high school senior and as a New England heavyweight wrestling champion when he was at MIT. Nearly made the Olympic team, too.
In his other life, David, former chairman of the Department of Astrophysics at the University of Chicago and manager of the Fermilab there, and ever the adventurer, aggressively plumbed the depths of the cosmos, and its Black Holes. In that pursuit, he did much to unite cosmic mysteries with those of particle physics, and found, in this unity, a greater understanding of the Big Bang of creation and the now accepted concept of an ever-expanding universe that followed.
A New York Times remembrance essay by Dennis Overbye following Dave’s death reported that the science community was stunned “that a man described as a force of nature could be gone.” Added British theoretical physicist Stephen W. Hawking, for whom Dave served as best man at his wedding, “. . . David was larger than life in so many ways.” David was looking for ultimate answers—the biggest “why” of all. I am sure that in the quiet confines of his lab, he had an “aha” moment or two, and I would so much like to have seen what Dave saw. I have often wondered if, as the poet John Magee said, he had “touched the face of God.” Doubtless, he has the answers now—and so will we all, some day.
I don’t know if there is an “adventure” gene in some members of the Schramm clan or not (although, in retrospect, as I look at my brothers and some of their offspring, and my own, I might perhaps be persuaded!). Be that as it may, as I stood there in 1954 facing whatever the future held for me, I didn’t know, nor could I, what astonishing dimensions my life would assume in the next few years.
My peers and I had registered for the draft each year beginning at age 18, and those of us in college, like me, had received deferments. So, having decided to take the plunge, I volunteered for the draft, as the procedure was called, and found myself being sworn into the army as a recruit on August 30, 1954. I was 22.
Off they sent me to Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, where I endured eight weeks of basic training, followed by another eight weeks of field artillery training. There, I learned to fire and clean all manner of firearms. Those drill sergeants were a breed apart, but I learned an unforgettable life lesson from their often raging, if not bullying, insistence on just about everything—that “there are no excuses; just get the job done, dammit!” The phrase clearly suits the military mission, but is not bad for the rest of us, too. Like most young people, I had often found a reason to put something off. Thereafter, however, I heard the demands of my drill sergeants ringing in my ears, making me feel compulsive at times.
And, when Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, published her book Lean In in 2012 urging that women take charge of their own lives and, as part of her charge, advising them (and everyone else, for that matter) to “relentlessly prioritize,” I felt an instant resonating connection between her call for urgency in the workplace and that demanded by my drill sergeants, both urging execution and achievement in the face of difficult tasks to be accomplished. Good lessons find ways to reinforce themselves.
Thus, I reconciled the seeming competition between my astrological predilections: Capricorn’s impulse to get the lead out is given direction by my Aquarian why-and-wherefore inquiries to get the humanitarian policy focus right. I’ve always been comfortable with that personality setting.
We were all then to be shipped off for further training, but we had some say-so in the matter. One of the options was to go airborne—strictly for volunteers. I thought that if I had to go into combat, I wanted to be with folks who were better trained for it and good warriors. And then, the adventure streak kicked in, and the thought that followed was that this could really be interesting and challenging and maybe even fun. So, without pondering it further, I volunteered, and was promptly shipped off to the 11th Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, not quite knowing what to expect. The paratroopers there made an immediate impression on me. For one thing, they seemed bigger; for another, their fatigues were starched, pressed, and spotless, and their bloused boots were polished like a mirror. These guys were proud. I liked that.
After processing, I was assigned to the 675 Airborne Field Artillery Battalion, and my company commander was 1st Lt. “Tiger” Jones who virtually growled his orders. His top sergeant was Sgt. DeLaskey whose face looked like my boxer, but who had a gentler side, I later discovered, which he kept well hidden. This was to be my home unit at Fort Campbell, but the first order of business was our airborne training. Actually, the first order of business was PT—physical training. It preceded everything an airborne unit did. We ran for miles at a time, often to a rhythmic cadence sounded off by our trainers. We did hundreds of pushups in a day, usually 20 at a time, interspersed with other forms of calisthenics. We did palms-out pullups, which I had never been able to do before. If a guy was out of sync in an exercise count, he was immediately identified and an order crisply issued, “Drop for 20, soldier!”
What I truly admired and will never forget is the time when the drill sergeant, who was up on a platform and doing all of the calisthenics with us, screwed up his own count, and volunteered, “My mistake! At ease! I will drop for 20,” at which point he dropped to do 20 pushups while the rest of us stood in formation, feet spread, hands clasped behind our backs, watching in stony silence—and with utter respect. If one ever had cause to wonder how these elite units develop such camaraderie and self-sacrifice in their ranks, this is one small illustration. With this physical routine every day, I never harbored any doubt that this was the best physical shape I had ever been in either before or since that time.
Doubtless, the most gratifying consequence of my assignment to this unit was meeting Bill Claggett. Bill had been in the service three or four months longer than I, had been earlier discovered by Sgt. DeLaskey and worked for him as the battery clerk. Bill, from Dayton, Ohio, had two Harvard degrees in city planning and was later to have a great career as a government advisor, professor, and consultant. Bill and I grew close as brothers and became lifelong friends.
Our airborne training proceeded apace. We practiced Parachute Landing Falls—PLFs as we called them—jumping hundreds of times from four foot platforms, learning how to distribute our weight as we hit the ground. Then they had a contraption about three stories high, sort of like a fire tower, where you strapped yourself into a parachute harness with lines attached to a cable above, waited for a jump command, and then threw yourself out of the door trying to keep a tight body position as you were sharply caught by the cable above and your legs fought the restraining harness that wanted to wrench them outward, all the while being zip-wired down to an end-point about fifty yards off.
The idea was to teach us, upon exiting an airplane, to maintain a tight body position—head down, arms clutching your reserve chute below your chest with your right palm over the D-ring, and legs bent slightly but absolutely together—no matter what air pressures were attempting to drive your members apart. If you couldn’t keep your legs together when jumping the tower—and it hurt to do so—then you had to do the tower way more than you wanted to.
After weeks of PT and jump school practice, we finally reached show time—an actual jump. I kept a Jump Log for all sixteen jumps that I made in the service, which identified the date, the drop zone, my stick position, the type of jump, and remarks about any unique features of the jump. All troopers have jump stories, and I would be no different.
March 7, 1955 arrived to mark the first of five qualifying jumps which is the number required to earn your airborne wings. (And I have mine to this day.) All of our jumps were to be from a C-119 aircraft, which looks like a bee and, aerodynamically, is not supposed to be able to fly—a body that looks too big for its wings to carry. But it flew. As battery clerk, Claggett was in charge of preparing the flight manifests—and he did me the dubious favor of placing me in the number one position in four of the five qualifying jumps (number two for the fifth).
That meant I was to be the first one to exit the aircraft from the port side. I was scared dizzy when we took off and, despite the earlier and easy bravado, said to myself, “Just what in the hell am I doing here?” Sitting next to the open port door, I could see the countryside below grow smaller as we climbed to our jump altitude of 1200 feet that day. The jump location was scheduled for the Yamoto Drop Zone (the DZs were named after combat jump locations during World War II).
We flew for about ten uneasy minutes before the jumpmaster began shouting the preparatory jump commands into the intercom: “Stand up and hook up!” was the first. We were lined up in two sticks facing the port and starboard doors. You could hear the clicks of all the static lines hooking onto the eye-level cables that ran the length of the plane for each stick. “Check your equipment!” was the next. We made sure that the static line of the trooper directly in front of us was free and clear of any obstruction and then lamely looked up and down our own harnesses to make sure we were all snapped in. Then the jumpmaster called off the landmarks below: “Highway 41 comin’ up!” A heart-pounding moment later, it was, “Stand in the door!” and I automatically pivoted into the open door, hands slapped against the outside of the plane, the icy air running across my knuckles, my legs bent slightly and then involuntarily giving way to the fear that gripped me, my head staring straight ahead, my last thought being, “I can’t believe I’m doing this!” as my mind then went absolutely blank and switched to auto pilot.
Then the last terrifying command came, as I felt the jumpmaster’s hand whack my rump, “Go!” he shouted, and I went, hurtling down as if in a howling hurricane, the prop wash pitching me into its wake nearly upside down, completely disoriented but trying to keep my body all buttoned up, the roar of the motors much louder on the outside! We were trained to begin a fourcount immediately, and I did: “Hup thousand! Two Thousand! Three Thousand! Four Thousand!” And all of a sudden, it was ghostly quiet! No wind, no motors, no point of reference on a first jump. I didn’t know what to expect. We were instructed to check the parachute canopy after the four-count, so I looked up: it was fully deployed, and I whispered, “Thank you, God!” I was able then to take stock. I felt all alone, pinned to the sky, and euphoric. The 50-60 second ride down was gentle and, without a doubt, the best part of the experience. There was no wind on the DZ and it was an easy landing. Breathing hard from the excitement, I was ecstatic—as were we all!
As we folded up our chutes and headed to the assembly point, the guys exchanged comments on the wonder of it all, but not one admitted—during those moments of self-congratulation and, dare I say, swagger—that he had been scared shitless! Notwithstanding, it was in moments like those that pride gushed in who we were and what we might accomplish together. It was especially felt on our daily runs, during the cadence call, with a collective roar: Air-BORNE! We were brothers. It felt good. It was a standard of togetherness that I never—well, rarely—saw replicated later in society but wished often that we could bottle it—the loyalty, the mutual regard regardless of background, the camaraderie, the brotherhood.
One down. We waited three weeks for the next jumps, and they just did them all at once: two on March 28th and the final two the next day, on March 29th. We would never have them spaced so closely together afterward. But we were official. Shortly thereafter we proudly accepted our airborne wings. The next 11 jumps in my brief airborne career were very exciting—how could they not be? In mass jumps, collisions could occur: one trooper had to spread eagle to keep from flying into my lines; another (involuntarily) landed on top of my chute, as I yelled up to him, “Not a good idea, buddy!” and he clambered off so his chute could re-deploy; and I had a near collision myself but was able to pull hard on my lines to slip by another trooper’s chute. Prop blasts spun me upside down several times. My air was stolen once by a guy who came in under me fairly close to landing, causing my chute to collapse and me to fall the last 25–30 feet, jarring the hell out of me, but nothing was broken thanks to that physical training our commanders insisted on.
Once, on a night jump, we literally could not see anything, and the opening shock produced a riser burn on my face; but the hard part was trying to gauge where the ground was for a landing; I went into my PLF at least five times before actually hitting the ground. And several times on landing, the wind was way up and just re-inflated our chutes and dragged us some 50-75 yards before we could right ourselves. I could hear hilarious laughter and cursing all around me, one friend later saying, “They needed a traffic cop out there to direct us!” Every paratrooper has stories with variations on these themes.
But my seventh jump, on May 16, 1955, was the jump to end all jumps—and it nearly did. One of the most memorable events of my life. I was number four on the starboard stick. Claggett reserved the number one spot for himself, which was okay with me! Believe it or not, as I was picking up my pre-packed chute (paratroopers had long since stopped packing their own; a special unit did that), I had a twinge that almost said, no, not that one. But I recovered quickly and chalked it up to pre-jump jitters. I should have listened. We were to jump from 1000 feet that day. Again, the C-119 was our aircraft. The jumpmaster barked the usual commands as we approached the Los Baños (Philippines) Drop Zone. We stood, hooked up, checked equipment and shuffled forward, almost touching one another, waiting for the red light next to the open door to turn green, which was the pilot’s signal to the jumpmaster that we had arrived at the DZ.
I could see the green light flash and heard the jumpmaster’s “Go!” as the pandemonium began; the rush to the door was filled with yelling and cussing (as I had found out later when I was back in the ranks and not the first one out); everyone was eager to get out the door (for some inexplicable reason!), and I just followed along, minus the screaming. At the number four position, it was only a matter of a few seconds before my turn came. I had learned, in those terrible moments, to shut down all thinking and just charge out the door, literally throwing caution to the winds. I tumbled in the gale but kept a tight body position as I began my count—hup-thousand on down to four thousand! I looked up to check my canopy, and found to my shocking surprise that the lines were furled up, kind of like a squid, with a bit of a puff at the very top of the canopy. I was hurtling down and was in a straight up-and-down position. I looked down and saw the ground just whooshing up at me, and decided not to do that again.
I was operating on pure adrenalin, my training kicked-in to automatic, I grasped the D-Ring on my reserve chute strapped on my front, and, instinctively knowing that this was not a time to think things over, pulled hard. I had never had occasion to resort to my reserve chute before, but we were told to feed it out to the wind, and I started to do that. Parachutes can steal air from each other, and, even though the main wasn’t deployed, it was preventing my reserve’s ability to deploy. So I decided instantaneously to maximize the chances of the main to deploy over the reserve chute, and began to haul in the reserve chute. I had done everything that I knew to do and was on the verge of losing hope when, all of a sudden, the main chute popped and I was on the ground hard within another second or two in a clump of trees, off the DZ.
Someone came running up to me and breathlessly asked, “Do you know where your chute opened?” You can’t gauge heights when you’re falling, so, full of optimism over my gift of life, I guessed, saying, “I don’t know—maybe 300 feet up?” And he said, “See the top of that tree? That’s where your chute opened!” The tree was maybe 60 to 75 feet tall. I could hardly believe it! They used to tell us that if you threw a sack of potatoes the weight of an average man out of an airplane 1,000 feet up it would land in about eight seconds. Everything I’ve described happened in rapid succession, and I estimate that the time it took me to reach the ground from the moment I exited the aircraft was no more than 10 to 12 seconds.
I began a conversation with God as I walked back to the assembly point. We got to know each other a lot better from then on. I saw Bill and he said he saw someone whistling by him on the way down, assuming the worst, not knowing it was me. The commanding officer seemed to be more concerned about the reasons for the malfunctioning parachute than about my wellbeing, but finally came over and asked if I was okay. Whenever a “bad” jump happens, they try to get you back up as soon as possible to ward off the evil spirits, so the CO said something to that effect to one of the ranking noncoms in our unit to ensure that I would have another jump soon. We usually jumped every month or so, sometimes two. I was up the following week, and that one went smoothly, as these things go. I said nothing to my family about all of this until after I was discharged from the service.
As it happened, May 16 was Bill’s birthday, so we began celebrating that date as the birthday for both of us. Years later I used to observe two birthdays during the course of a year, but Dorian insisted that I had to choose just one. So I chose my re-birth of May 16. Besides, it made me 23 years younger than my original birthday, and that’s the one we observe to this day.
That parachute jump had a profound effect on my life, and on my view of life as a precious estate. It also marked the beginning of a spiritual journey for me that has deepened and enriched my life beyond measure. I could have exited my life at that time. But it was given back to me. I like to think that there was a reason, and, because of it, that maybe I should hold myself to a high standard—not a high-er standard. I believe we all should hold ourselves to a high standard, but everyone is in charge of his or her own commitment and journey to reach that higher plane.
I have chosen to take my journey quite seriously, and to use this gift of life, as my lights might allow, in service to others. The injunction to “repair the world” took on a whole new dimension for me, and I saw it not only as a fundamental Judaic teaching, but as a universal teaching that is equally reflected in all the great religions of the world. We don’t have to fight with one another over whose religion says it best. I believe we are all endowed with a spark of the Divine and that our true selves will live on beyond this “mortal coil.” But we each have a responsibility to make this life a good one for everyone, and we can do that by first recognizing that we are all part of one human family—with Divine roots.
How could this not influence my political view of the world? Interestingly, in recent years when I have tried to teach democracy to Muslims in the Middle East, I always sought to invoke the teachings of Muhammad who—wisely—enjoins his followers to respect the worth of the other person. It follows, I maintain, that such mutual respect is the beginning of problem-solving without resort to violence, and, as the circle of this practice widens, a more peaceful world is thereby given a chance to unfold. This mutual respect is often expressed as love, or kindness, or good will. They all work. And while progress has been made, I needn’t list the proofs that we still have a long way to go. For all we know, perhaps the history of this planet—whether as a place of good will or a destroyed wasteland—will be measured by the success, or lack thereof, of our aggregated individual journeys to make it a better place. As I see it, each of us thus bears some responsibility for our shared destiny, and—though it’s not for me to say—perhaps some accountability, too.
Meanwhile, as we settled back to earth, the friendship between Bill Claggett and me deepened. In August, 1955, we were transferred en masse to the storied 82nd Airborne Division at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina, where we continued our airborne training on the Drop Zones of Normandy, Salerno, and Holland. I was assigned to the Headquarters Detachment of division headquarters, instead of a line unit, where I assume the personnel folks thought my college education could be most effectively used. And there I remained until my tour ended a year later.
Claggett was assigned to another unit, but we maintained our close friendship and saw one another frequently. We mused about the prospect of international travel together after our service tours were over. We became serious about it, and began speculating about where we might go. I took it upon myself to begin writing embassies to find out about visa requirements. That brought me into contact, unbeknownst to me at the time, with the Counter-Intelligence Corps.
We were in the midst of the Cold War with the Soviet Union at the time, and there was great uncertainty about the future. Senator Joseph McCarthy began stirring up the people with incendiary accusations, without proof, about Communist affiliations. I sat in on one of McCarthy’s hearing during my Colgate semester in Washington, and he was indeed a bully. While McCarthy was condemned by the Senate on December 2, 1954, for “conduct that tended to bring the Senate into dishonor and disrepute,” the social context in the country was nevertheless one of great anxiety.
Into that milieu, I blithely and naively sent a letter to the Soviet Embassy in Washington—along with a dozen or two similar letters to other embassies—seeking information on travel to and within the Soviet Union and what visa requirements a traveler might be expected to meet. I saved everything—copies and responses—neatly clipped in a file that I kept in the bottom drawer of my desk in my office. Well, that letter of inquiry to the Soviet Embassy precipitated a wide-ranging espionage investigation into me. I didn’t find out about it until just before my discharge, when my good friend and barracks bunk neighbor, Johnny Byrd, said to me, “Jack, I think I can tell you now that your case has been closed.”

“One of the best in a generation of outstanding leaders from both parties, Jack Schramm writes here about his fight for integrity in government, politics, policy, and society. Jack was a brilliant legislator who fought for the causes he believed in: justice, education, governance reform, environment, housing, income equality, and so much more. He was an activist who didn’t wait for change, but caused it. As a change agent with purpose, vision, and integrity, Jack’s book should inspire a new generation of change agents.
— BOB HOLDEN, former Governor of Missouri (D)
“The rule of law . . . politics . . . government service . . . insightful consulting. Few master any of these, but Jack Schramm mastered them all in his public career. When he didn’t find consensus, he created it. When others needed perspective, he crafted it. He never abandoned principle. Read Jack’s absorbing memoir and discover what his friends already know: He’s more than a politician who found multiple ways to serve. He is a man who has done good . . . and done it very, very well.”
— JOHN ASHFORD, Chairman, The Hawthorn Group—

“In October 2010, Jack Schramm delivered the keynote address at Iraq’s first National Legislative Conference. His strategy for federal power-sharing influenced a debate that eventually resulted in a 2013 amendment clarifying provincial authority to make law, a significant step forward. Hopefully, other seeds that Jack planted in his highly skilled mentoring work in democratic governance will bear fruit there in Iraq in years to come.”
— LAMAR CRAVENS, former Chief of Party,
USAID’s Local Governance Program in Iraq
“Jack, an outstanding student of government, knew the rules and applied them successfully in passing consequential legislation on behalf of all Missourians. It was a joy to work with him. Read Jack’s journey and experience, too, the joy of an insightful governance adventure.”
— JIM CONWAY, former Mayor of St. Louis (D) and State Senator
“Schramm (is) considered one of the most effective legislators ever to sit in the Missouri House.”

Dedication
A
S I COMPLETE this retrospective of my adventure through life, and reflect on how deeply thankful I am for the opportunity to have experienced so many of its dimensions and to have learned so much, I have carefully considered whether there was any one human being whose contribution was so primal that it made everything possible for me. There is, in fact, one such person who deeply touched my life, or, I should say, made my life possible. That person is my maternal grandfather, Abraham Goruch. He was a highly respected family leader, to be sure, though he otherwise walked humbly through his life. But one fateful day in 1911, on his inhospitable home soil of Russia, he performed an extraordinary act of personal bravery in the face of a marauding Cossack band that threatened both him and the lives of his family. As recounted in the pages that follow, he instinctively, courageously, and selflessly rose to confront that fearful and imminent danger and, at great risk to himself, succeeded in protecting them from harm. In so doing, my grandfather changed the lives of his family and its descendants forever. That included my mother, then 10 years old, and, in turn, me. It is not that his brave act changed the quality of my life; it made my life possible. So in dedicating this book to him, I proudly and gratefully honor my grandfather who, in the most profound way, gave me both the gift of life itself and the inspiration to endeavor without surcease to put it to some useful purpose.
Acknowledgments
G
RATITUDE WITH A FULL HEART is first extended to my wife, Dorian, whose love, encouragement, and forbearance during the writing of this memoir never faltered. And to my talented nephew, Dean Schramm, a Hollywood literary agent and producer, learned in the writing and publishing arts, I shall always be grateful for wise counsel and unwavering encouragement. Paul Edwards, my Kansas City campaign manager and later, an author with his wife Sarah of 17 books, was enormously helpful with suggestions, edits, and contacts. I extend special thanks, also, to my publishers at New Insights Press, especially to managing editor Rick Benzel for his many editing improvements and for leading me through the publishing maze, and to art director Susan Shankin for her brilliant cover design and book layout. I am blessed with a large group of friends, many talented writers themselves, who, with care not to hurt my feelings too much, offered thoughtful and very helpful edits to the manuscript. I list them here (alphabetically) with heartfelt gratitude: Hilary Claggett, Wynne Cougill, Cliff Johnson (my Middle East motorcycle partner), Sheldon Novick (a biographer of note), Lonnie Shalton, Judith Slaughter, and Mary Allen Wilkes. And there were so many others, beloved family as well as friends around the world, who encouraged me to write it all down. They include a unique group of Missouri legislative friends, many named in the book, who, during our tenure, took the name, ROSD—or Royal Order of Shit Disturbers, which says it all. We still meet annually. The camaraderie is delicious.
Prologue
A
WORD ABOUT HOW this book came to be: As I moved through the winter of my professional life, I began to think that I might have at least one book in me. But I wasn’t thinking about any kind of memoir at all. I liked public policy and was kind of wonky about it; in fact, as I thought about a book, I thought that maybe I could organize one around a series of essays on the great issues of the day. The topics that came to mind included climate change, Israel-Palestine, the Electoral College, immigration reform, wherefore the United Nations, unbundling Islamic teachings, and the like. Plenty of stuff out there that excites peoples’ curiosity. But that’s as far as I got. I couldn’t get the project under way because I kept saying to myself, “Who cares what I think about these issues? There are lots of scholarly treatises about them.”
Word got around to my friends and colleagues about my writing project, and, assuming it was a memoir, they peppered me with questions about it. “Will you talk about your assignments to Iraq and living in Saddam’s palace and getting bitten by rats?” Or, “Will you reveal that your first marriage was in Tangier, Morocco after a shipboard romance?” Or, “Can you work in why those Pennsylvania legislative leaders complained about you to the White House?” Or, “You won’t omit that paratroop outing when your ‘chute finally decided to open at tree-top level?” Or, “Please tell everyone about how your Missouri legislative cabal, your Royal Order of Shit Disturbers, your ROSD—how they got that name!” Or, “I loved your motorcycle adventure from Baghdad through the Middle East; it will be great to finally get the whole story.” Or, “Tell us, are we still waiting, or did China ever implement your environmental recommendations?” Or, “It will be sad but memorable to recall that election night in ’72 when we waited for the returns to come in on your lieutenant governor’s race!” And on and on it went. My friends were all very excited to read about my political episodes, consulting on four continents, and personal adventures. Their enthusiasm was marvelous, and they assumed I would definitely write about my own life. But—again—that’s not where my head was. I had my doubts. Who, besides family and friends, would be interested?
Informal remarks on my life in governance at the 50th Reunion of our Washington University Law School class
Unless, I thought one day, I could use my experiences to impart something useful to a general audience, but especially those interested in politics and perhaps having a lengthy career, as mine has been, in government. Then, as I was pondering that question, I had something of an epiphany. It was staring me right in the face. My whole life had been devoted to governance in one form or another, whether executing it as an elected and appointed official or as a consultant in so many places around the world—if I could make governance my central theme, maybe it would work. And so the plan for this book began to take shape.
I could talk about my bumpy political journey and the governance insights I gleaned from my experiences at the state, federal, and international levels—and perhaps, I speculated, others would benefit from those insights as well. My life experience, as I stopped to think about it, was very broad and the stories at each level were rich in political intrigue, power trips, and, especially as to the international work, an insider’s look into what was happening behind the headlines. I could sketch out my early years and what forces formed my thoughts about government and contributing to better the world.
Though my school friends and I considered ourselves as American as apple pie, we were all first generation Americans, and we saw this country through the eyes of our ever-grateful parents and their friends. The influences were subtle but quite real, as were others in those formative years. When I went away to college, and later, I began to see differences in my peers—in our upbringing, our values, and our points of view about the world. For example, I never heard a negative word about President Franklin Roosevelt until I was a sophomore in college! He was practically worshipped by the adults in my early life. Those early years were when my values took shape—and my naiveté and sensitivities were challenged—and they became key to the directions I took in my later professional life. I had an adventure streak a mile wide and a curiosity about the unknown, what life was about beyond my neighborhood and schools. I explored, reached out and touched things I had experienced only in books. My military experience and my worldwide travel—I didn’t want to do what, or go where, everybody else did—taught me a great deal about self-reliance, experimentation . . . and the value of seeking. It was important that I talk about those things in my book as well; they contributed to how I got to be who I am, and why I think as I do. And they became governance values every bit as much as the experiences I had in my neighborhood growing up and during my education. I like to think of it all as context.
So, finally, I had a formula for a book. I was to be a vehicle—constructed uniquely from many parts, to be sure—to provide glimpses into how government worked at many different levels. I had to explain it through the only lens I knew—me. But it wasn’t to be just about me and all of my ego—but what I learned about governance—a distinction very important to me.
Moreover, I didn’t want it to be a textbook, for heaven’s sake. The glimpses and the lessons were simply to accompany my trip through life. They were not to be served up on a silver platter, but to be ingested in a natural flow with each course of my life’s various passages. I was blown off course several times—as have we all.
For me, each new course proved to be not only useful but purposeful. I think I have been fortunate in that regard, though I do believe that it is important that we not give up on trying to make our lives count for something in the larger scheme of things. If that comes through in this book, I would be proud to be the messenger, and maybe that’s lesson enough. I hope you will bear with me as I move through some of the substantive issues I encountered in my journey. I have tried not to be too technical or legalistic about those things, but I wanted to serve up some of the flavor of the work I did, both domestically and internationally, and I trust I have found a proper balance and not been too off-putting. I hope that there is something to be learned from the experiences I have had—about governance and other things. But you be the judge.
PART 1
VALUES AND THE FORMATIVE YEARS
ONE
First Generation Life in America
M
Y WORLD BEGAN at 1:45 a.m. on Thursday, January 21, 1932 at the Missouri Baptist Hospital in St. Louis—an Aquarian, as astrology would hold, who would see the world as one closely-related human family and would paint in broad strokes. And because I landed on the cusp of Capricorn, the stars further predicted that I was to be given strength of purpose and the fortitude to move my objectives forward. Both would later prove to be my strongest inner instincts, though, I also found, they were no guarantor of success.
I was the third of four sons, and we were born in couplets. The elder pair, Marvin and Norman (in that order), were born in the 1920s with their names reflecting a more traditional world. Seven years elapsed before I came along, followed 21 months later by brother Paul, our names reflecting perhaps a tilt toward modernity. Marv and Norman, perceived by us in those early years as much older, went off to serve in the armed forces during World War II. Paul and I, closer in age, shared more of life’s experiences. We were first generation Americans. I had no idea that this was a significant demographic until decades later. We were American as apple pie, strongly patriotic—and poor. We were, after all, in the middle of the Great Depression. But that characteristic was common to everyone we knew. My mother’s maiden name was Frieda Sylvia Goruch. Born in 1901, she was second eldest of four daughters and a son, born to Abraham and Rebecca Goruch (or Goruchovsky before it was anglicized). She lived in a shtetl just outside of Kiev in what is now Ukraine, but was then under Russian rule. Jews weren’t allowed to live within the boundaries of Kiev proper. She used to tell us that the floor of their home was bare earth. Everyone had a trade in the shtetls of the time, and my maternal grandfather (born in 1875) made his living as a tailor.
Pogroms were deadly and feared by the shtetl populations of Eastern Europe during those terrible years, particularly from 1880 through 1914 when anti-Semitism raged throughout the Russian Empire. It seemed that much of the blame for all the troubles of society was laid at the feet of the already ostracized Jews, and it would only get worse unless they found a way out of there. Ukrainian Russia, where my family lived, was somehow a particular hotbed for government-sanctioned pogroms, though the Czar vehemently denied any role on his part.
One fateful day in 1911 my mother’s settlement was attacked by marauding Russian Cossacks on horseback, one swooping in to assault my grandfather, then 33, and his family. Putting his family behind him, my grandfather ran forward to intercept the rider and threw him from his horse. Since resistance was not tolerated, my grandfather had to leave his family following the altercation and flee for his life! With the parting words, “I will get you out!” he made his way to Hamburg where he hid in a lifeboat on an ocean liner bound for New Orleans. Once there, he slipped off the ship and managed to follow the Mississippi River north up to St. Louis where other immigrants he knew had settled, including (helpfully) his father, who had peacefully, to use the word loosely, emigrated there in January 1909.
There were, of course, many other European immigrant groups in that era who were escaping from very difficult circumstances, but few who feared daily for their very safety as did the Jews of the time. In the case of my grandfather, it’s accurate to say that he was one of America’s early undocumented aliens. The memory of his story is seared into my conscience and unceasingly reminds me of my own personal commitment to supporting a proper solution to a significant item of America’s unfinished business—the plight of America’s current crop of undocumented aliens. It should be easily understood that the punishing experience of the Jewish Diaspora over two millennia has forged into the DNA of successive generations of Jews, down to the present one, a sensitivity to the plight of the downtrodden and a yearning for a just society. As events will bear out in this personal account, it is certainly there in mine, as imperfect in its expression as my fettered humanity has allowed. But it is unmistakably there. What America, cloaked in an ever struggling exceptionalism, so importantly adds to the mix is a unique collection of governance values—an exciting infusion of profound democratic community—that offers a realistic hope of perfecting such a society in the fullness of time.
In the old immigrant neighborhoods of St. Louis, my grandfather, resolutely trying to find his way, found an abandoned storefront on 6th Street which, as luck would have it, contained a scrapped sign in the back that read, “Buck the Tailor.” So, with that welcoming token bestowed no doubt by his guardian angels (whose work was pretty good so far), my brave and embattled grandfather became Buck the Tailor! He saved his nickels and dimes for two years at the trade he knew, and then sent for his family who had been holding their own with the help of friends and extended family on the outskirts of Kiev.
My grandmother’s family, and her sister’s family as well, eleven strong (six Goruchovsky’s and five Kranitzky’s) arrived in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on January 13, 1913. The Canadian Pacific Railroad then ushered them down to Detroit where they were admitted into the United States, finally, feeling absolutely incredulous over what was happening in their lives. Immigration officials, as they did with so many of the European unpronounceables, shortened my grandmother’s name from Goruchovsky to Goruch and her sister’s name from Kranitzky to Crane. They then traveled overland to St. Louis—my mother was 12—where they had a joyous reunion with my grandfather who, then, impatiently escorted them to his tailor shop where they would live for a time. It had a wooden floor! Happily re-unified, the family continued its struggle for survival, but at least in freedom in this new world of theirs—no small consideration if one stops to think about it, and, as I came to believe, one that we take for granted at our peril.
Many decades later, I had a consulting assignment in Kiev. Our threesome hailed a taxi and went to visit the Babi Yar Memorial, a ravine on the outskirts of the city. It was there that the Nazis, in their war against the Soviet Union, rounded up all the Jews in the Kiev region for what they said was transportation to another holding area. Then they were told to dig further into the ravine. Over the next two days, September 29th and 30th 1941, in a ruthless operation, Nazi Sonderkommandos murdered all 33,771 Jews who were gathered there—men, women, and children. It was one of the largest single massacres in the history of the Holocaust. Other later victims at the site included thousands of Soviet POWs, communists, Gypsies, Ukrainian nationalists, and civilian hostages. Estimates are that 100,000 to 150,000 lives were taken in that ravine.
I stood there looking at it, next to the memorial, in utter disbelief, trying to conjure up the abject terror that had been experienced there and which has become a bitter lesson in the failures of humanity. I was gripped by a realization, known casually as just family history before, but shockingly thrust into my consciousness in that moment: My mother and her family would have been totally wiped out in 1941 in that ravine had my grandfather not escaped himself and sent for them 28 years earlier. Maybe my father’s family as well. We knew the stories, but standing there right in the middle of the reality of it all was overwhelming. Why do some live and some die? It reinforced my deeply felt curiosity about such bewildering issues which had plagued me for years . . . and still do.
My father, Benjamin Jacob Schramm, was born in 1899 in Volhynia Gaberna, located maybe 175 miles west of Kiev in the northwest sector of present-day Ukraine. In alternating periods of time a part of Poland, Prussia, Austria, or Russia, it belonged to the Russian Empire when my father came onto the scene.
Second eldest of four children, my father was the only boy. The anglicized names of his parents were Frank and Ida Schramm. My paternal grandfather was born about 1870 and was a Talmud teacher and scholar. Interestingly, the name Schramm is a fairly common German name. German emigration to Volhynia Gaberna, mostly from Poland but also from some German provinces, grew to a population estimated at some 200,000 by the turn of the century. So somewhere down the line, my father’s forbears took on the same name of their Christian German neighbors—probably their landowners, in much the same way, I would guess, an African American bore the name of his ancestors’ slave owners. But conditions of the Volhynian Germans began to deteriorate in the late 19th century and thousand began to emigrate to both the United States and Canada.
My paternal grandfather, like so many of his Volhynian German neighbors, took his family and emigrated to America in 1905, and made their way to St. Louis also. My father was just six. Once in St. Louis, my grandparents on both sides, still unknown to one another, settled into life—the Goruches (my grandfather finally succumbed to the practicalities of this shortened version) on Carr Street and the Schramms in a nearby neighborhood—in what is now downtown St. Louis. This is the area where most of the Eastern European immigrants gathered. Some called it a Jewish ghetto, not unlike the living habits that had been forced upon them for centuries in the shtetls of the Eastern European diaspora. It was a mutual protection and comfort thing.
My father was a good student, especially in math, and made it through the eighth grade. My mother went through the fifth grade, and left school to help out at home. A love of music, and an aptitude for its expression led my father to violin lessons. He developed a real flair for technique but his passion was especially evident as he pursed his lips and leaned forward, his body and bow arm in rhythmic synchronicity, surging from dulcet to brio on both instrument and brow, as he transited the emotional phrasing in a sweeping melody of Tchaikovsky or Beethoven. My father was in charge and ecstatic when he was doing his music—his thing. It showed on his face. It was good to see, as he didn’t have that kind of happiness—in a protracted sense—as the years wore on.
The early years were better and more promising. It was inevitable that my father would become a professional musician—and an accomplished one. Professional opportunities began to come, and he found himself organizing and leading small groups of musicians for weddings and other functions.
As he broke into his twenties, buoyed by his music and feeling lighthearted, he was emboldened to turn to matters of the heart. He met Frieda Goruch, a beautiful young girl with a pug nose and regular Slavic-like features. She agreed to accompany him on some of his playing engagements, sitting off to the side and proudly watching her boyfriend entertain all those strangers. It was kind of exciting for them both. Unable to deny their love for each other, they married in 1920—he was 21 and she 19. Thus began the tumultuous life of Ben and Frieda Schramm.
Marvin arrived in 1922 and Norman in 1924. The Roaring 20’s was a time of opportunity for musicians, perhaps the most successful time of my father’s life, as he was engaged to play dinner music at the (still) fashionable Chase Hotel. A large black sign with silver glitter letters reading “Ben Schramm and his Orchestra” hung over the stage—and he kept that sign for all the ensuing decades of his life in a closet wherever he lived.
In 1927, and feeling ready, my parents emigrated from the City of St. Louis to the County of St. Louis (two different jurisdictions). They wanted to be where the rest of the Jewish community was moving—into the adjoining suburb of University City (so named because it abutted Washington University in St. Louis and many of its streets were named for universities: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, Tulane, Colgate, Dartmouth, the more prominent ones). The family lived in three apartments over the next nine years. The stock market crashed in 1929 and the depression had engulfed everyone.
My father’s music business crashed, too. He tried to open up a dry cleaning business, but he refused to pay protection to the mob—so they threw a bomb through his window and that ended that. My mother thought she had to do something to earn some money, so she bought some hosiery and underwear at discount prices and then sold them to the employees at several hotels who agreed to the purchases if they could pay for them a little each week. So she marked up the articles and sold them at a profit. She began regular collections for these sales. And her business grew to include furniture and appliances and a retail store owner backed her with merchandise.
Her customers were all in the black community, and this kind of arrangement was the only way they could afford those necessities. She was trailblazing, one could argue, the credit card economy we have today. She didn’t know it, but she also had started the feminist movement.
As my mother was getting underway in her business, we moved to our fourth apartment in 1936. I was four. All of these apartments were located in an area called the Delmar Loop, so named because it was the streetcar turnaround for the westernmost reach of the then ‘mass transit’ system of St. Louis. Our new apartment was a third floor walkup at 6319 Delmar Boulevard, right on the main drag. The Loop was U. City’s business district and stretched for about eight blocks beyond the city line.
At the far end of the business district was Delmar-Harvard Grade School (at the corner of Delmar and Harvard Avenue), where brother Paul and I attended grade school. My political career started in kindergarten where my teachers (Miss Olmstead and Miss Iseley—I’ll never forget them) appointed me the fire chief of a red fire wagon that we had built. I remember being surprised. From humble beginnings and all that . . . .
Times were still tough for everyone in the Loop. FDR and the federal government created the Works Progress Administration (or WPA as it was popularly known) in 1935 to preserve the skills and self-respect of the working people of America. It lasted until 1943. They did everything—from infrastructure to the arts. It included the creation of the WPA symphony orchestra that played every week in University City’s Heman Park. My father signed up as a violinist, as did many of his musician friends. We frequently went to listen to the orchestra on a summer evening. My father earned about $90.00 a month, which helped with the rent, while my mother earned the grocery money.
We lived in that Delmar apartment all the way through my first year of law school. It was home. Early on, my mother’s credit business attracted other entrants—all men. About a dozen of them banded together, along with my mother (the only woman), to pool their purchasing power so that they could buy their merchandise at favorable prices. Mom held her own with the men—and her boys were proud of her, though we didn’t quite realize how extraordinary she was. The family members—all of us—just forged ahead with our lives. And enjoyed the dinners she cooked for us every evening, which we just took for granted.
My father never seemed to be able to get a toehold in business, and tried several ventures into the 1940’s. He was an artist, not a businessman, and seemed very unhappy most of the time. He was able to join several community orchestras, the first in University City and the second in Kirkwood (another suburb), and I truly think those were lifesavers for him.
One day when I was about 10, I got a look at life in the raw. My mother hired one of her customers, Margaret, to clean the house once a week to pick up the slack for her. Margaret was like one of the family. On a warm sunny day, Margaret asked if I would like a root beer—a real treat because I knew it meant going down the street to visit Blondie & Dick’s Root Beer Stand, an outdoor arrangement vividly painted in orange and black, and extremely popular in the Loop. We were seated at the bar and there were no other customers. Margaret paid for a large mug and I chugged most of it down but couldn’t finish it, so I passed it over to Margaret and asked her to finish it for me. She smiled, put the mug to her lips, and no sooner had she done that, when Blondie appeared—she startled me—and snatched the mug right out of Margaret’s hands, saying, “Sorry!”
I was only a little guy, but I was dumbstruck! I knew what had happened but could hardly believe it. Margaret was denied service by Blondie because, and only because, she was black (“African American” wasn’t in vogue yet). Margaret was hurt. I could tell it, but she held onto her dignity. I hurt, too, for Margaret, and was so very embarrassed. It just wasn’t right, I remembered thinking. We walked home in silence, but that scene remained with me throughout my life, and has informed my conscience on matters of race whenever it was in my power to do something about it. I didn’t yet know what politics was about but I believe we all face character-building moments, as this one was for me, and we either experience some kind of propulsion within us that directs us to want to make change, or we don’t. Whoever is in charge of imprinting consciences found an easy mark in me.
Little by little I began to develop a notion about how people should treat one another. I was a bit shy and serious—but proud. Not flashy or show-offy proud. But I wanted to be upstanding and didn’t want to be criticized for not doing the right thing. I then had a personal experience as a youngster that challenged my self-righteousness, if I can call it that. Every Jewish kid in my generation experienced prejudice at one time or another. Every one.
On one occasion, I was forced into a physical fight—the only one I ever had. I was only about 11. About five neighbor kids, including my brother Paul and me, went over to have some fun at an abandoned construction site nearby. We weren’t there five minutes when five older boys suddenly appeared; they were from nearby Christ the King parochial school, who were notorious for seeking out “Jew-boy Christ-killers” and beating them up. They let it be known that we were their targets. Our little group fled wildly down the hill—except me. I was too proud to run, though I don’t know what came over me. I just stood there frozen to the ground. Brother Paul was frantically calling to me to run.
The bullies selected one of their number to do the honors. Meanwhile, Paul and the other kids ran home and screamed at my brother Norman (who was 17 or 18) ‘to come rescue Jack who was getting beaten up.’ Norm rushed back with the other kids, and we were still grappling. But Norman was the equalizer and, for the sake of everyone’s pride, I guess it was, wisely asked if we wanted to fight it out, and we both nodded yes, almost automatically. To tell the truth, I wasn’t so sure. But, knowing it would now be a fair fight, and the others wouldn’t pile on, I was energized and became very aggressive, slugging the guy. After a bit, I yelled, “Tell me when you’ve had enough!” And he finally did. The bullies made a fast exit, and I remember the triumphant walk home, Norman, with his arm around my shoulder, beaming down at his little brother.
The ferocity of anti-Semitism has moderated with the passing of each generation—from the shtetls and Holocaust of my grandparents’ and parents’ time, to the present where it is certainly the case that our children have been less exposed to this mindless hatred. But it’s still out there, perhaps worse in the subtler (and sometimes not so subtle) expressions of racial bias experienced by African Americans. And today the LGBT community and Latinos are experiencing some of the same kinds of senseless hatred that stands in the way of love and acceptance of our fellow human beings. Although, over time, we assuredly have done better, we should hope that the trajectory improves.
So, if one is born into a cauldron of “them” and “us,” attitudes are shaped. Certainly mine were shaped—as one of “them”—by personally witnessing and experiencing, even at a tender age, the callousness of hatred, the damage it inflicts, and the sorrow it leaves behind. I cannot square it with any concept of cosmic morality that I have encountered. Others may be born into, and come to identify with a culture of “us vs. them.” It must be very difficult to wrest one’s mind from this kind of negativity and the divisiveness that those influences tend to weave into one’s DNA. The struggle between these two forces has been played out in America since our beginnings as we try to “form a more perfect union.” I happen to believe that the expansion of personal liberties will continue, but those of like mind will need to persevere to make it happen.
Nowadays the “other side,” to put it gently, is more sophisticated in its discrimination. It couches its lack of concern for “them” in the polemics of such phantoms as fear of takeover (reflected in restrictive immigration policy and absence of gun control), fear of abuse (reflected in hobbled voting rights ), Biblical injunction (reflected in restraints on LGBT rights, women’s rights), big government intrusiveness (reflected in seeking an unshackling from economic, environmental, and all manner of regulation), and constitutional exhortation (using the Constitution to restrict rather than enlarge rights—such as using the 10th Amendment ‘powers reserved to the states’ clause to de-fang Federal jurisdiction or the 14th Amendment ‘due process’ clause to undo abortion rights).
TWO
Political Nascence: The Fledgling Years
S
EVERAL YEARS AGO when I joined my classmates in St. Louis for the 50th reunion of our graduation from the Washington University School of Law, we were asked to explain the circumstances surrounding our decision to study law and what our legal careers were all about. When my turn came, I said I had wanted to become a lawyer since the age of 12, but that my principal motivation was not so much to practice but rather to make law. I didn’t know where that came from, I joked, unless I had been in the Roman Senate in a previous life. The way politics gripped my life throughout my school years, and ineluctably directed me toward politics later, has made me wonder where in the world that inner drive and motivation truly came from.
Even in my neighborhood growing up, and still in grade school, I seemed to have had a penchant for organizing things. It wasn’t anything special, and I didn’t attach any significance to it. I suggested stuff and the kids just followed along. For example, I organized a “Bike Patrol,” looking for I don’t know what, evil-doers, I suppose. Also an “army” of 12 young stalwarts—and I was the general, of course. This was during World War II and we even did hikes as training maneuvers and “played guns.” The NRA would have been proud! Probably the most fun was the cork ball league I organized where St. Louis kids (it’s the only place it’s played) learned to hit lightning fast balls and curves, thrown with a tennis ball, with a sawed-off broomstick. And that morphed into a fast pitch baseball team that I organized to play against other neighborhood teams, all before we were in high school. We used to create our own amusements as there were no professional youth organizers or clubs in the 1940s.
My 7th to 9th grade happened at Ward Junior High School. As we reached the end of the 8th grade and the election of next year’s student council president loomed, I found myself a candidate, at the behest of some friends. It was 1945 and the world was consumed by the prospect of World War II coming to an end. The surrender of Germany and Japan (the latter prompted by the use of atomic weapons) was only a few months off. So in my speech to the student body, I spoke of the scourge of war and how we had to be steadfast in the face of its challenges. Never mind what I would do for the school, if elected. I was only 13, had just been bar mitzvahed a few months earlier and obviously had taken the Hebrew injunction of Tikun Olam (Repair the World) perhaps too seriously, for this election anyway. But so it would be for the rest of my life. Well, I won the election (my first), and I was teasingly reminded of that speech by classmates as many as 30 years later! In this, I learned that if you can’t do relevance, memorable is good!
The next phase of my busy life took place at University City Senior High School. From ages 15 through 17, everything was new and wonderful, and included sports, fraternities, dating, and school politics, too. Sports, especially, consumed me. I was good at baseball and lettered in all three of my high school years. I also played American Legion baseball and in summer industrial leagues—with and against players who went to the major leagues.
Then there were clubs, the school newspaper, and, of course, the student council. My home room class elected me to the student council in the 10th grade. I worked hard in my studies and became a self-starter as I knew help from home was unlikely. Academically, I was above average and finally made the honor roll in my last couple of semesters. Grades were truly earned in those days the hard way.
The end of the 11th grade came and, with it, campaign time for the office of student body president for our senior year. Or, to be more precise, for the first half of our senior year; the school administration thought it best to share this school honor between two students, one for each semester. Again, friends urged me to run. I would never have run without their encouragement, as my shy self would have thought it too presumptuous to run otherwise. Election day came and we gave our speeches. I don’t remember what I said, but I won (or maybe my campaign manager, Chuck Walker, won; he gave a very entertaining speech). So, on this one, I learned that if you can’t do substance, entertainment is good!
Senior year came, and it was an exciting one. Presiding over the student council and its work, chair of the Junior-Senior Prom Committee, I was also selected (I don’t remember how) to be Mayor of University City for a Day. I continued to take everything seriously. One day, Miss Briscoe, our student council faculty sponsor, gently nudged me not to overdo it by saying, “Jack, I heard one girl say that she would love it if you would just smile!” Notwithstanding, in the final tallies for senior class ‘most this and that,’ Dick Dutton, student body president in the second semester, and I tied as “Most Popular Boy.” So maybe it was okay to be serious-minded!
Of course, during senior year, the thoughts of almost all of my classmates turned to college—where would we go? U. City High School had developed a sterling reputation in the university community as among the best high schools in St. Louis County—and there were dozens. About 90% of its graduates went on to college. Everyone was expected to. Most of us were first generation Americans and “People of the Book,” and we knew that education was a path to the American dream. It was 1949. The Great Depression and World War II both had ended, and I instinctively felt that education would help me accomplish things that were beginning to stir deeply within me. For those of us living in the Delmar Loop especially, we couldn’t wait to get started.
Since Princeton and Harvard took our academic stars, it was hard for me not to dream, too, about going to an Eastern college. My family certainly could not afford it. So while I was awaiting some celestial guidance, the admissions dean from Colgate University in Hamilton, New York decided to visit our high school for the first time, based on our reputation. I attended—and was hooked by pictures of the beautiful campus in a small town, an all-male student body of only 1,300, the core curriculum of philosophy and religion, public affairs, the study of an alternative culture, but mostly by the prospect of joining the Washington Study Group for a semester of studying the federal government right there in its offices. Though it was late in the season, I sent for an application and, shortly thereafter, was contacted by Tom DePew, Colgate’s college advisor for St. Louis. We hit it off famously. A successful businessman, Tom always wanted to help deserving people, often saying to me throughout the course of a lifelong friendship, “We’ve got to help them, Jack!” I didn’t realize at the time that I was one of his early projects. He proved to be one of the most decent people I have ever known.
I needed a scholarship and Tom went to bat for me to be sure I received one. What I didn’t know until well after I had graduated was that I had applied too late for financial aid for my freshman year, and that Tom had arranged with the school to pay for my freshman year himself. He really wanted me to go to Colgate! (I have since established a scholarship at Colgate as a way of repaying Tom’s poignant and indelible kindness.) My record after my first year persuaded Colgate, going forward, to cover my annual tuition and provide work in the library and dining facilities to defray room and board. This amounted to two-thirds of the cost of attending, or $1,600.00 per year. My parents footed the remaining third, or $800.00. How things have changed, as fellow parents will attest!
My freshman year at Colgate was exciting. I made lots of friends, pledged Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, one of the more popular ones, and in contravention of its ‘only for Christians’ clause. Again, I was asked to run for freshman class president by friends. As I recall, my speech was about how all of us should receive invitations to the fraternities, as Princeton had done for its eating clubs, because those who were left out (about 15% of the class) truly missed an important social dimension offered by the college. The idea was that if one was good enough to be admitted to the college, he was good enough to be admitted to a fraternity. I won the election. It was then that I knew I would be elected Student Senate president for my senior year. And that’s what happened. It was a strange feeling because it was almost as if I could will my success in these elections. My arrogance would get its comeuppance as time went on, but I was feeling my oats at the time.
My life at Colgate was truly fulfilling. After the freshman class presidency, my fraternity thought I should represent it in the Student Senate, which served only to whet my appetite for more. “Politics” is the word commonly used to describe this kind of activity, but I didn’t use the term. I thought it was much more like a responsibility that one should exercise on behalf of one’s fellows. I was still possessed of that serious and very idealistic turn of mind. After my sophomore year, I won a scholarship from the Experiment in International Living to spend the summer in Morelia, Mexico living with a Mexican family, where I soaked up the culture and language, and broadened my vistas. With courses in International Law and International Organization, I was really getting turned on to the international scene.
During my junior year, my international affairs professor, Dr. Robert Elder, had me appointed to two inter-collegiate positions that would further excite my interest in international policy. The first was as president of the Upstate New York Model United Nations Security Council, comprised of eleven regional universities, which I found intriguing. The second appointment, somewhat more challenging, was as a Main Committee chair at meetings of the Mid-Atlantic Model United Nations General Assembly being held, of all places, at the United Nations Building in New York City. Well, let me tell you—how could a young person not be impressed by conducting even faux UN business in the ECOSOC Chamber itself!
Apparently I was not so bad at doing presiding officer stuff because, at the close of our three day meetings, and in the session where the participants (representing some 60 colleges and universities from the Mid-Atlantic states) were to select the presiding officers for the following year’s session, I was elected to serve as president of the General Assembly. Again, I thought to myself, what is going on here?
Back at Colgate, at the end of my junior year, I was elected student body president and presided over the Student Senate for the first semester of my senior year, but had to turn the gavel over to the vice president (Vail Taylor, a wonderful and deservedly well-respected guy) in the second semester so I could spend that semester in Washington, D.C. with the Washington Study Group. But I had an insight during a philosophy course with Dr. Holmes Hartshorne during that first semester that has remained with me throughout my political life. Dr. Hartshorne explained the American political experience as a national commitment to the autonomous individual. “Well, what does that mean,” he probed?
“Autonomous,” he explained, “derives from two Greek words: ‘autos’ meaning self and ‘nomos’ meaning reason or order. Thus, the self-reasoning or self-ordered individual.”
Then Dr. Hartshorne went on to apply this fundamental concept to our political parties. “The Republicans,” he explained, “emphasize the ‘autos’ or self and are identified with free private enterprise, the values of liberty, and untrammeled, to the extent possible, individual expression. And, for their part, Democrats emphasize the ‘nomos’ and thus are more identified with the reasonable use of government to achieve order and social welfare, emphasizing the equality of individuals in the process. But each carries the seeds and values of the other so that they both can lay claim to a commitment to the autonomous individual. Thus, while Republicans want to reduce regulation and allow Wall Street and the banks to exercise their financial and business creativity for the benefit of all, they would be hesitant to overturn the ‘nomos’ dimension of the equation as represented by Social Security or perhaps other social measures.”
“And the Democrats,” Dr. Hartshorne continued, “although fully committed to the beneficial uses of government as reflected in the ‘nomos’ dimension of this equation, are at the same time committed to the private enterprise system, liberty, and private expression as reflected in the ‘autos,’ perhaps not as ardently as the Republicans, but it is a strongly shared value nonetheless.”
That little insight, as explained by Dr. Hartshorne, was an epiphany for me, and I have carried those words with me throughout my life. They are a great summary of American political life. To me, they mean that we are a nation of shared values. There is more that unites us than divides us. Our differences are a matter of degree. The American political process of transparency and openly debating our differences is designed to allow us to glimpse what the other guy is thinking, to understand it even if we don’t agree with it, and to work to resolve our differences in a peaceful way. The “autonomous individual”—this way of thinking about who we are—is a notion that encapsulates our common worth and has always brought us together in times of national stress. It has kept me sane.
My final semester in Washington, D.C. was a memorable experience! We were ten students, both seniors and juniors, and, as it happened, split down the middle politically—five Republicans and five Democrats. By this time, I knew that my heart was firmly planted on the Democratic side of the aisle. I was able to sharpen my debating skills as we argued all the time, even on the trolley every morning as we headed up to the Capitol from the YMCA where we stayed. That was my first taste of anyone daring to articulate to my face a difference with the way I saw the world! I was comfortable with my views and initially wondered how in the world they—my classmates—could come to such different conclusions. Didn’t we have the same facts and concerns? Well, needless to say, I got quite an education in public policy from my Republican friends. A shot across my naïve bow! What a politically sheltered life I had led!
It was 1953 and Dwight Eisenhower was president, having defeated Adlai Stevenson—such a refined, intelligent fellow, I remember musing—the year before. The semester was eye-opening at so many levels—from a visit in the White House to interview Ike’s press secretary; to a personal interview with Vice President Richard Nixon; to a period of study in the State Department (as a group) and then the Department of Labor (we each had to choose an agency); and, finally, in connection with our study of Congress, its members, and the legislative process, to some three weeks or so as an intern in our own congressman’s office—mine was Representative Tom Curtis, a Republican representing the greater part of St. Louis County. I remember thinking to myself that, someday, I would run for that selfsame seat—and I did some 23 years later, in 1976. Clearly, by this time, I had an undeniable feeling that politics was to be my calling.
Midway through the semester, Dr. Elder and I took a long weekend off to head to Ithaca, N.Y, where I was to assume my responsibilities as President of the Mid-Atlantic Model UN General Assembly. It was to convene at the Cornell Law School. I worked closely, and also shared a dormitory room, with Peter Kenen, a Columbia University student who had been selected to be the Secretary-General. I addressed him as “Peter” and he addressed me as “Your Excellency.” Peter was brilliant and played his role to the hilt. He later received his doctorate at Harvard and, from 1971 through 2004, was the Walker Professor of Economics and International Finance at Princeton and became internationally renowned.
By that time, I had presided over so many student groups that I remember having felt fairly confident and comfortable in managing the flow of debate and occasionally interceding to push along the resolution of an issue. It was a confidence-builder for me and a very satisfying learning experience. When we were packing up to go home following a crowded few days of international problem-solving with wonderfully creative peers—we all wished that we could have had a real go at these issues—Dr. Elder, with whom I had developed a warm relationship, privately whispered to me, “Jack, when you get into this work for real, don’t forget to contact me for consulting purposes!” Given the knowledge imbalance between my professor and me, that he would suggest that I hire him some day—did I really hear what I heard? Though stunned, I was secretly very pleased with what I was doing to warrant Dr. Elder’s confidence.
Dr. Elder and I returned to the program in Washington, concluded our semester’s work in May, and returned to campus to prepare for graduation for those of us who were seniors. I finished my academics with a deep major in political science and two minors—one in philosophy and one in Spanish, both of which I truly relished. I sat with the political science faculty for the departmental honors exam, a daunting exercise! My GPA put me in the top 10% of my class which qualified me for the honors exam with cum laude standing. It could have been magna but for a few C’s in my first couple of semesters while I was learning how to study at the college level. A leak that a faculty friend coaxed out of several political science faculty colleagues revealed to our collective glee that my oral exam was of high honors caliber. But I was delighted, after all was said and done, to graduate Cum Laude with Honors in Political Science from a place like Colgate; I also felt honored to have been admitted to both the junior and senior honorary societies and to have been awarded a George W. Cobb Fellowship for leadership. More than delighted for a boy from the Delmar Loop.
THREE
The Influences of Law School and Military Service
I
WAS ADMITTED TO the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis where I began my first year of legal studies in the Fall of 1953. I lived at home in the Loop, could walk to classes, and had a scholarship loan from the St. Louis Scholarship Foundation. It was good not to be a further financial burden to my parents, who were busy helping my brother Paul through undergraduate school, and later law school, at the University of Missouri-Columbia, some 120 miles away. To have the credential—a law degree—was an enthralling prospect for me.
What a budding lawyer learns from the very beginning is the necessity of finding the core issue of a problem at the very outset of a dispute, how to express it and be right about it. It is necessary in this kind of analysis to put aside any coloration of the issue, whether based in emotion or philosophy, and see it as it is—the reality of the matter in the bright light of day. Being clear-eyed about a problem’s core issues and dimensions is the sine qua non to its satisfactory resolution. Resorting to morality and philosophy are fine when addressing the resolution question, but it is imperative to be realistic about the fundamental problem you are faced with.
I have always felt that the study of the law was an excellent preparation for a career in politics or in the development or execution of public policy. To be sure, one can learn to be an effective public practitioner through other professional disciplines, but, at least in my opinion, the best preparation for a socio-legal gap analysis and the application of an apt legislative solution is legal training. I hasten to add, however, that I think it would be a mistake to have a legislative body solely comprised of lawyers. A policy-making body benefits from a wide range of life experiences. For me and my inclinations though, I was satisfied that legal training would best equip me for public policy analysis and leadership.
We learned all about research methods and how to use the library in that first year. We didn’t have computers then and no access to lightning fast answers to majority and minority rules in any given jurisdiction. Instead we plowed through the books, took copious notes on what we found, painstakingly “shepardized” our cases, as we called it, to ensure that their holdings had not been later overruled or amended, and then laboriously hunt-and-pecked on our old typewriters to complete our research papers.
Well into my second semester, I started to think hard about the final two years of law school, and especially about the prospect of piling up further debt through the scholarship loan, which was still available to me. The GI Bill was another option open to me but only for a few more months since the Korean War was in the process of officially winding down in 1954. I decided to go for it. I kept my own counsel in this process, as I did for most things—master of my own fate kind of thing. This was characteristic of all of my collegiate decision-making, and truly felt throughout my life that I was the one, the only one, really in charge of my destiny. Not to be too dramatic about it, but I felt that I was the one to take my fate—my own fate—into my own hands, that no one could do for me what I was supposed to do for myself.
Truth be told, I had something of an adventurous streak within me. It was related to my natural curiosity and extended to unknown things, places, and experiences, sort of a fascination with things beyond my ken. This curiosity about the unknown later led me to spiritual places that helped me come to terms with my place in the world, and to accept both my disappointments and successes with equanimity—a sense of balance and calm.
In that broader connection, I always both admired and envied my genius nephew, David Schramm (a 6’4” red-headed giant of a man and eldest son of brother Marvin), who was short-listed for a Nobel in astrophysics before his untimely accidental death in 1997 at the age of 52, flying his own plane (having picked up the love of flying airplanes from his father). A physical as well as an intellectual adventurer, Dave climbed mountains on every continent, except Antarctica, despite having several near-death experiences. He learned the rough and tumble side of life as an all-state wrestler as a Missouri high school senior and as a New England heavyweight wrestling champion when he was at MIT. Nearly made the Olympic team, too.
In his other life, David, former chairman of the Department of Astrophysics at the University of Chicago and manager of the Fermilab there, and ever the adventurer, aggressively plumbed the depths of the cosmos, and its Black Holes. In that pursuit, he did much to unite cosmic mysteries with those of particle physics, and found, in this unity, a greater understanding of the Big Bang of creation and the now accepted concept of an ever-expanding universe that followed.
A New York Times remembrance essay by Dennis Overbye following Dave’s death reported that the science community was stunned “that a man described as a force of nature could be gone.” Added British theoretical physicist Stephen W. Hawking, for whom Dave served as best man at his wedding, “. . . David was larger than life in so many ways.” David was looking for ultimate answers—the biggest “why” of all. I am sure that in the quiet confines of his lab, he had an “aha” moment or two, and I would so much like to have seen what Dave saw. I have often wondered if, as the poet John Magee said, he had “touched the face of God.” Doubtless, he has the answers now—and so will we all, some day.
I don’t know if there is an “adventure” gene in some members of the Schramm clan or not (although, in retrospect, as I look at my brothers and some of their offspring, and my own, I might perhaps be persuaded!). Be that as it may, as I stood there in 1954 facing whatever the future held for me, I didn’t know, nor could I, what astonishing dimensions my life would assume in the next few years.
My peers and I had registered for the draft each year beginning at age 18, and those of us in college, like me, had received deferments. So, having decided to take the plunge, I volunteered for the draft, as the procedure was called, and found myself being sworn into the army as a recruit on August 30, 1954. I was 22.
Off they sent me to Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, where I endured eight weeks of basic training, followed by another eight weeks of field artillery training. There, I learned to fire and clean all manner of firearms. Those drill sergeants were a breed apart, but I learned an unforgettable life lesson from their often raging, if not bullying, insistence on just about everything—that “there are no excuses; just get the job done, dammit!” The phrase clearly suits the military mission, but is not bad for the rest of us, too. Like most young people, I had often found a reason to put something off. Thereafter, however, I heard the demands of my drill sergeants ringing in my ears, making me feel compulsive at times.
And, when Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, published her book Lean In in 2012 urging that women take charge of their own lives and, as part of her charge, advising them (and everyone else, for that matter) to “relentlessly prioritize,” I felt an instant resonating connection between her call for urgency in the workplace and that demanded by my drill sergeants, both urging execution and achievement in the face of difficult tasks to be accomplished. Good lessons find ways to reinforce themselves.
Thus, I reconciled the seeming competition between my astrological predilections: Capricorn’s impulse to get the lead out is given direction by my Aquarian why-and-wherefore inquiries to get the humanitarian policy focus right. I’ve always been comfortable with that personality setting.
We were all then to be shipped off for further training, but we had some say-so in the matter. One of the options was to go airborne—strictly for volunteers. I thought that if I had to go into combat, I wanted to be with folks who were better trained for it and good warriors. And then, the adventure streak kicked in, and the thought that followed was that this could really be interesting and challenging and maybe even fun. So, without pondering it further, I volunteered, and was promptly shipped off to the 11th Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, not quite knowing what to expect. The paratroopers there made an immediate impression on me. For one thing, they seemed bigger; for another, their fatigues were starched, pressed, and spotless, and their bloused boots were polished like a mirror. These guys were proud. I liked that.
After processing, I was assigned to the 675 Airborne Field Artillery Battalion, and my company commander was 1st Lt. “Tiger” Jones who virtually growled his orders. His top sergeant was Sgt. DeLaskey whose face looked like my boxer, but who had a gentler side, I later discovered, which he kept well hidden. This was to be my home unit at Fort Campbell, but the first order of business was our airborne training. Actually, the first order of business was PT—physical training. It preceded everything an airborne unit did. We ran for miles at a time, often to a rhythmic cadence sounded off by our trainers. We did hundreds of pushups in a day, usually 20 at a time, interspersed with other forms of calisthenics. We did palms-out pullups, which I had never been able to do before. If a guy was out of sync in an exercise count, he was immediately identified and an order crisply issued, “Drop for 20, soldier!”
What I truly admired and will never forget is the time when the drill sergeant, who was up on a platform and doing all of the calisthenics with us, screwed up his own count, and volunteered, “My mistake! At ease! I will drop for 20,” at which point he dropped to do 20 pushups while the rest of us stood in formation, feet spread, hands clasped behind our backs, watching in stony silence—and with utter respect. If one ever had cause to wonder how these elite units develop such camaraderie and self-sacrifice in their ranks, this is one small illustration. With this physical routine every day, I never harbored any doubt that this was the best physical shape I had ever been in either before or since that time.
Doubtless, the most gratifying consequence of my assignment to this unit was meeting Bill Claggett. Bill had been in the service three or four months longer than I, had been earlier discovered by Sgt. DeLaskey and worked for him as the battery clerk. Bill, from Dayton, Ohio, had two Harvard degrees in city planning and was later to have a great career as a government advisor, professor, and consultant. Bill and I grew close as brothers and became lifelong friends.
Our airborne training proceeded apace. We practiced Parachute Landing Falls—PLFs as we called them—jumping hundreds of times from four foot platforms, learning how to distribute our weight as we hit the ground. Then they had a contraption about three stories high, sort of like a fire tower, where you strapped yourself into a parachute harness with lines attached to a cable above, waited for a jump command, and then threw yourself out of the door trying to keep a tight body position as you were sharply caught by the cable above and your legs fought the restraining harness that wanted to wrench them outward, all the while being zip-wired down to an end-point about fifty yards off.
The idea was to teach us, upon exiting an airplane, to maintain a tight body position—head down, arms clutching your reserve chute below your chest with your right palm over the D-ring, and legs bent slightly but absolutely together—no matter what air pressures were attempting to drive your members apart. If you couldn’t keep your legs together when jumping the tower—and it hurt to do so—then you had to do the tower way more than you wanted to.
After weeks of PT and jump school practice, we finally reached show time—an actual jump. I kept a Jump Log for all sixteen jumps that I made in the service, which identified the date, the drop zone, my stick position, the type of jump, and remarks about any unique features of the jump. All troopers have jump stories, and I would be no different.
March 7, 1955 arrived to mark the first of five qualifying jumps which is the number required to earn your airborne wings. (And I have mine to this day.) All of our jumps were to be from a C-119 aircraft, which looks like a bee and, aerodynamically, is not supposed to be able to fly—a body that looks too big for its wings to carry. But it flew. As battery clerk, Claggett was in charge of preparing the flight manifests—and he did me the dubious favor of placing me in the number one position in four of the five qualifying jumps (number two for the fifth).
That meant I was to be the first one to exit the aircraft from the port side. I was scared dizzy when we took off and, despite the earlier and easy bravado, said to myself, “Just what in the hell am I doing here?” Sitting next to the open port door, I could see the countryside below grow smaller as we climbed to our jump altitude of 1200 feet that day. The jump location was scheduled for the Yamoto Drop Zone (the DZs were named after combat jump locations during World War II).
We flew for about ten uneasy minutes before the jumpmaster began shouting the preparatory jump commands into the intercom: “Stand up and hook up!” was the first. We were lined up in two sticks facing the port and starboard doors. You could hear the clicks of all the static lines hooking onto the eye-level cables that ran the length of the plane for each stick. “Check your equipment!” was the next. We made sure that the static line of the trooper directly in front of us was free and clear of any obstruction and then lamely looked up and down our own harnesses to make sure we were all snapped in. Then the jumpmaster called off the landmarks below: “Highway 41 comin’ up!” A heart-pounding moment later, it was, “Stand in the door!” and I automatically pivoted into the open door, hands slapped against the outside of the plane, the icy air running across my knuckles, my legs bent slightly and then involuntarily giving way to the fear that gripped me, my head staring straight ahead, my last thought being, “I can’t believe I’m doing this!” as my mind then went absolutely blank and switched to auto pilot.
Then the last terrifying command came, as I felt the jumpmaster’s hand whack my rump, “Go!” he shouted, and I went, hurtling down as if in a howling hurricane, the prop wash pitching me into its wake nearly upside down, completely disoriented but trying to keep my body all buttoned up, the roar of the motors much louder on the outside! We were trained to begin a fourcount immediately, and I did: “Hup thousand! Two Thousand! Three Thousand! Four Thousand!” And all of a sudden, it was ghostly quiet! No wind, no motors, no point of reference on a first jump. I didn’t know what to expect. We were instructed to check the parachute canopy after the four-count, so I looked up: it was fully deployed, and I whispered, “Thank you, God!” I was able then to take stock. I felt all alone, pinned to the sky, and euphoric. The 50-60 second ride down was gentle and, without a doubt, the best part of the experience. There was no wind on the DZ and it was an easy landing. Breathing hard from the excitement, I was ecstatic—as were we all!
As we folded up our chutes and headed to the assembly point, the guys exchanged comments on the wonder of it all, but not one admitted—during those moments of self-congratulation and, dare I say, swagger—that he had been scared shitless! Notwithstanding, it was in moments like those that pride gushed in who we were and what we might accomplish together. It was especially felt on our daily runs, during the cadence call, with a collective roar: Air-BORNE! We were brothers. It felt good. It was a standard of togetherness that I never—well, rarely—saw replicated later in society but wished often that we could bottle it—the loyalty, the mutual regard regardless of background, the camaraderie, the brotherhood.
One down. We waited three weeks for the next jumps, and they just did them all at once: two on March 28th and the final two the next day, on March 29th. We would never have them spaced so closely together afterward. But we were official. Shortly thereafter we proudly accepted our airborne wings. The next 11 jumps in my brief airborne career were very exciting—how could they not be? In mass jumps, collisions could occur: one trooper had to spread eagle to keep from flying into my lines; another (involuntarily) landed on top of my chute, as I yelled up to him, “Not a good idea, buddy!” and he clambered off so his chute could re-deploy; and I had a near collision myself but was able to pull hard on my lines to slip by another trooper’s chute. Prop blasts spun me upside down several times. My air was stolen once by a guy who came in under me fairly close to landing, causing my chute to collapse and me to fall the last 25–30 feet, jarring the hell out of me, but nothing was broken thanks to that physical training our commanders insisted on.
Once, on a night jump, we literally could not see anything, and the opening shock produced a riser burn on my face; but the hard part was trying to gauge where the ground was for a landing; I went into my PLF at least five times before actually hitting the ground. And several times on landing, the wind was way up and just re-inflated our chutes and dragged us some 50-75 yards before we could right ourselves. I could hear hilarious laughter and cursing all around me, one friend later saying, “They needed a traffic cop out there to direct us!” Every paratrooper has stories with variations on these themes.
But my seventh jump, on May 16, 1955, was the jump to end all jumps—and it nearly did. One of the most memorable events of my life. I was number four on the starboard stick. Claggett reserved the number one spot for himself, which was okay with me! Believe it or not, as I was picking up my pre-packed chute (paratroopers had long since stopped packing their own; a special unit did that), I had a twinge that almost said, no, not that one. But I recovered quickly and chalked it up to pre-jump jitters. I should have listened. We were to jump from 1000 feet that day. Again, the C-119 was our aircraft. The jumpmaster barked the usual commands as we approached the Los Baños (Philippines) Drop Zone. We stood, hooked up, checked equipment and shuffled forward, almost touching one another, waiting for the red light next to the open door to turn green, which was the pilot’s signal to the jumpmaster that we had arrived at the DZ.
I could see the green light flash and heard the jumpmaster’s “Go!” as the pandemonium began; the rush to the door was filled with yelling and cussing (as I had found out later when I was back in the ranks and not the first one out); everyone was eager to get out the door (for some inexplicable reason!), and I just followed along, minus the screaming. At the number four position, it was only a matter of a few seconds before my turn came. I had learned, in those terrible moments, to shut down all thinking and just charge out the door, literally throwing caution to the winds. I tumbled in the gale but kept a tight body position as I began my count—hup-thousand on down to four thousand! I looked up to check my canopy, and found to my shocking surprise that the lines were furled up, kind of like a squid, with a bit of a puff at the very top of the canopy. I was hurtling down and was in a straight up-and-down position. I looked down and saw the ground just whooshing up at me, and decided not to do that again.
I was operating on pure adrenalin, my training kicked-in to automatic, I grasped the D-Ring on my reserve chute strapped on my front, and, instinctively knowing that this was not a time to think things over, pulled hard. I had never had occasion to resort to my reserve chute before, but we were told to feed it out to the wind, and I started to do that. Parachutes can steal air from each other, and, even though the main wasn’t deployed, it was preventing my reserve’s ability to deploy. So I decided instantaneously to maximize the chances of the main to deploy over the reserve chute, and began to haul in the reserve chute. I had done everything that I knew to do and was on the verge of losing hope when, all of a sudden, the main chute popped and I was on the ground hard within another second or two in a clump of trees, off the DZ.
Someone came running up to me and breathlessly asked, “Do you know where your chute opened?” You can’t gauge heights when you’re falling, so, full of optimism over my gift of life, I guessed, saying, “I don’t know—maybe 300 feet up?” And he said, “See the top of that tree? That’s where your chute opened!” The tree was maybe 60 to 75 feet tall. I could hardly believe it! They used to tell us that if you threw a sack of potatoes the weight of an average man out of an airplane 1,000 feet up it would land in about eight seconds. Everything I’ve described happened in rapid succession, and I estimate that the time it took me to reach the ground from the moment I exited the aircraft was no more than 10 to 12 seconds.
I began a conversation with God as I walked back to the assembly point. We got to know each other a lot better from then on. I saw Bill and he said he saw someone whistling by him on the way down, assuming the worst, not knowing it was me. The commanding officer seemed to be more concerned about the reasons for the malfunctioning parachute than about my wellbeing, but finally came over and asked if I was okay. Whenever a “bad” jump happens, they try to get you back up as soon as possible to ward off the evil spirits, so the CO said something to that effect to one of the ranking noncoms in our unit to ensure that I would have another jump soon. We usually jumped every month or so, sometimes two. I was up the following week, and that one went smoothly, as these things go. I said nothing to my family about all of this until after I was discharged from the service.
As it happened, May 16 was Bill’s birthday, so we began celebrating that date as the birthday for both of us. Years later I used to observe two birthdays during the course of a year, but Dorian insisted that I had to choose just one. So I chose my re-birth of May 16. Besides, it made me 23 years younger than my original birthday, and that’s the one we observe to this day.
That parachute jump had a profound effect on my life, and on my view of life as a precious estate. It also marked the beginning of a spiritual journey for me that has deepened and enriched my life beyond measure. I could have exited my life at that time. But it was given back to me. I like to think that there was a reason, and, because of it, that maybe I should hold myself to a high standard—not a high-er standard. I believe we all should hold ourselves to a high standard, but everyone is in charge of his or her own commitment and journey to reach that higher plane.
I have chosen to take my journey quite seriously, and to use this gift of life, as my lights might allow, in service to others. The injunction to “repair the world” took on a whole new dimension for me, and I saw it not only as a fundamental Judaic teaching, but as a universal teaching that is equally reflected in all the great religions of the world. We don’t have to fight with one another over whose religion says it best. I believe we are all endowed with a spark of the Divine and that our true selves will live on beyond this “mortal coil.” But we each have a responsibility to make this life a good one for everyone, and we can do that by first recognizing that we are all part of one human family—with Divine roots.
How could this not influence my political view of the world? Interestingly, in recent years when I have tried to teach democracy to Muslims in the Middle East, I always sought to invoke the teachings of Muhammad who—wisely—enjoins his followers to respect the worth of the other person. It follows, I maintain, that such mutual respect is the beginning of problem-solving without resort to violence, and, as the circle of this practice widens, a more peaceful world is thereby given a chance to unfold. This mutual respect is often expressed as love, or kindness, or good will. They all work. And while progress has been made, I needn’t list the proofs that we still have a long way to go. For all we know, perhaps the history of this planet—whether as a place of good will or a destroyed wasteland—will be measured by the success, or lack thereof, of our aggregated individual journeys to make it a better place. As I see it, each of us thus bears some responsibility for our shared destiny, and—though it’s not for me to say—perhaps some accountability, too.
Meanwhile, as we settled back to earth, the friendship between Bill Claggett and me deepened. In August, 1955, we were transferred en masse to the storied 82nd Airborne Division at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina, where we continued our airborne training on the Drop Zones of Normandy, Salerno, and Holland. I was assigned to the Headquarters Detachment of division headquarters, instead of a line unit, where I assume the personnel folks thought my college education could be most effectively used. And there I remained until my tour ended a year later.
Claggett was assigned to another unit, but we maintained our close friendship and saw one another frequently. We mused about the prospect of international travel together after our service tours were over. We became serious about it, and began speculating about where we might go. I took it upon myself to begin writing embassies to find out about visa requirements. That brought me into contact, unbeknownst to me at the time, with the Counter-Intelligence Corps.
We were in the midst of the Cold War with the Soviet Union at the time, and there was great uncertainty about the future. Senator Joseph McCarthy began stirring up the people with incendiary accusations, without proof, about Communist affiliations. I sat in on one of McCarthy’s hearing during my Colgate semester in Washington, and he was indeed a bully. While McCarthy was condemned by the Senate on December 2, 1954, for “conduct that tended to bring the Senate into dishonor and disrepute,” the social context in the country was nevertheless one of great anxiety.
Into that milieu, I blithely and naively sent a letter to the Soviet Embassy in Washington—along with a dozen or two similar letters to other embassies—seeking information on travel to and within the Soviet Union and what visa requirements a traveler might be expected to meet. I saved everything—copies and responses—neatly clipped in a file that I kept in the bottom drawer of my desk in my office. Well, that letter of inquiry to the Soviet Embassy precipitated a wide-ranging espionage investigation into me. I didn’t find out about it until just before my discharge, when my good friend and barracks bunk neighbor, Johnny Byrd, said to me, “Jack, I think I can tell you now that your case has been closed.”

Dedication
A
S I COMPLETE this retrospective of my adventure through life, and reflect on how deeply thankful I am for the opportunity to have experienced so many of its dimensions and to have learned so much, I have carefully considered whether there was any one human being whose contribution was so primal that it made everything possible for me. There is, in fact, one such person who deeply touched my life, or, I should say, made my life possible. That person is my maternal grandfather, Abraham Goruch. He was a highly respected family leader, to be sure, though he otherwise walked humbly through his life. But one fateful day in 1911, on his inhospitable home soil of Russia, he performed an extraordinary act of personal bravery in the face of a marauding Cossack band that threatened both him and the lives of his family. As recounted in the pages that follow, he instinctively, courageously, and selflessly rose to confront that fearful and imminent danger and, at great risk to himself, succeeded in protecting them from harm. In so doing, my grandfather changed the lives of his family and its descendants forever. That included my mother, then 10 years old, and, in turn, me. It is not that his brave act changed the quality of my life; it made my life possible. So in dedicating this book to him, I proudly and gratefully honor my grandfather who, in the most profound way, gave me both the gift of life itself and the inspiration to endeavor without surcease to put it to some useful purpose.
Acknowledgments
G
RATITUDE WITH A FULL HEART is first extended to my wife, Dorian, whose love, encouragement, and forbearance during the writing of this memoir never faltered. And to my talented nephew, Dean Schramm, a Hollywood literary agent and producer, learned in the writing and publishing arts, I shall always be grateful for wise counsel and unwavering encouragement. Paul Edwards, my Kansas City campaign manager and later, an author with his wife Sarah of 17 books, was enormously helpful with suggestions, edits, and contacts. I extend special thanks, also, to my publishers at New Insights Press, especially to managing editor Rick Benzel for his many editing improvements and for leading me through the publishing maze, and to art director Susan Shankin for her brilliant cover design and book layout. I am blessed with a large group of friends, many talented writers themselves, who, with care not to hurt my feelings too much, offered thoughtful and very helpful edits to the manuscript. I list them here (alphabetically) with heartfelt gratitude: Hilary Claggett, Wynne Cougill, Cliff Johnson (my Middle East motorcycle partner), Sheldon Novick (a biographer of note), Lonnie Shalton, Judith Slaughter, and Mary Allen Wilkes. And there were so many others, beloved family as well as friends around the world, who encouraged me to write it all down. They include a unique group of Missouri legislative friends, many named in the book, who, during our tenure, took the name, ROSD—or Royal Order of Shit Disturbers, which says it all. We still meet annually. The camaraderie is delicious.
Prologue
A
WORD ABOUT HOW this book came to be: As I moved through the winter of my professional life, I began to think that I might have at least one book in me. But I wasn’t thinking about any kind of memoir at all. I liked public policy and was kind of wonky about it; in fact, as I thought about a book, I thought that maybe I could organize one around a series of essays on the great issues of the day. The topics that came to mind included climate change, Israel-Palestine, the Electoral College, immigration reform, wherefore the United Nations, unbundling Islamic teachings, and the like. Plenty of stuff out there that excites peoples’ curiosity. But that’s as far as I got. I couldn’t get the project under way because I kept saying to myself, “Who cares what I think about these issues? There are lots of scholarly treatises about them.”
Word got around to my friends and colleagues about my writing project, and, assuming it was a memoir, they peppered me with questions about it. “Will you talk about your assignments to Iraq and living in Saddam’s palace and getting bitten by rats?” Or, “Will you reveal that your first marriage was in Tangier, Morocco after a shipboard romance?” Or, “Can you work in why those Pennsylvania legislative leaders complained about you to the White House?” Or, “You won’t omit that paratroop outing when your ‘chute finally decided to open at tree-top level?” Or, “Please tell everyone about how your Missouri legislative cabal, your Royal Order of Shit Disturbers, your ROSD—how they got that name!” Or, “I loved your motorcycle adventure from Baghdad through the Middle East; it will be great to finally get the whole story.” Or, “Tell us, are we still waiting, or did China ever implement your environmental recommendations?” Or, “It will be sad but memorable to recall that election night in ’72 when we waited for the returns to come in on your lieutenant governor’s race!” And on and on it went. My friends were all very excited to read about my political episodes, consulting on four continents, and personal adventures. Their enthusiasm was marvelous, and they assumed I would definitely write about my own life. But—again—that’s not where my head was. I had my doubts. Who, besides family and friends, would be interested?
Informal remarks on my life in governance at the 50th Reunion of our Washington University Law School class
Unless, I thought one day, I could use my experiences to impart something useful to a general audience, but especially those interested in politics and perhaps having a lengthy career, as mine has been, in government. Then, as I was pondering that question, I had something of an epiphany. It was staring me right in the face. My whole life had been devoted to governance in one form or another, whether executing it as an elected and appointed official or as a consultant in so many places around the world—if I could make governance my central theme, maybe it would work. And so the plan for this book began to take shape.
I could talk about my bumpy political journey and the governance insights I gleaned from my experiences at the state, federal, and international levels—and perhaps, I speculated, others would benefit from those insights as well. My life experience, as I stopped to think about it, was very broad and the stories at each level were rich in political intrigue, power trips, and, especially as to the international work, an insider’s look into what was happening behind the headlines. I could sketch out my early years and what forces formed my thoughts about government and contributing to better the world.
Though my school friends and I considered ourselves as American as apple pie, we were all first generation Americans, and we saw this country through the eyes of our ever-grateful parents and their friends. The influences were subtle but quite real, as were others in those formative years. When I went away to college, and later, I began to see differences in my peers—in our upbringing, our values, and our points of view about the world. For example, I never heard a negative word about President Franklin Roosevelt until I was a sophomore in college! He was practically worshipped by the adults in my early life. Those early years were when my values took shape—and my naiveté and sensitivities were challenged—and they became key to the directions I took in my later professional life. I had an adventure streak a mile wide and a curiosity about the unknown, what life was about beyond my neighborhood and schools. I explored, reached out and touched things I had experienced only in books. My military experience and my worldwide travel—I didn’t want to do what, or go where, everybody else did—taught me a great deal about self-reliance, experimentation . . . and the value of seeking. It was important that I talk about those things in my book as well; they contributed to how I got to be who I am, and why I think as I do. And they became governance values every bit as much as the experiences I had in my neighborhood growing up and during my education. I like to think of it all as context.
So, finally, I had a formula for a book. I was to be a vehicle—constructed uniquely from many parts, to be sure—to provide glimpses into how government worked at many different levels. I had to explain it through the only lens I knew—me. But it wasn’t to be just about me and all of my ego—but what I learned about governance—a distinction very important to me.
Moreover, I didn’t want it to be a textbook, for heaven’s sake. The glimpses and the lessons were simply to accompany my trip through life. They were not to be served up on a silver platter, but to be ingested in a natural flow with each course of my life’s various passages. I was blown off course several times—as have we all.
For me, each new course proved to be not only useful but purposeful. I think I have been fortunate in that regard, though I do believe that it is important that we not give up on trying to make our lives count for something in the larger scheme of things. If that comes through in this book, I would be proud to be the messenger, and maybe that’s lesson enough. I hope you will bear with me as I move through some of the substantive issues I encountered in my journey. I have tried not to be too technical or legalistic about those things, but I wanted to serve up some of the flavor of the work I did, both domestically and internationally, and I trust I have found a proper balance and not been too off-putting. I hope that there is something to be learned from the experiences I have had—about governance and other things. But you be the judge.
PART 1
VALUES AND THE FORMATIVE YEARS
ONE
First Generation Life in America
M
Y WORLD BEGAN at 1:45 a.m. on Thursday, January 21, 1932 at the Missouri Baptist Hospital in St. Louis—an Aquarian, as astrology would hold, who would see the world as one closely-related human family and would paint in broad strokes. And because I landed on the cusp of Capricorn, the stars further predicted that I was to be given strength of purpose and the fortitude to move my objectives forward. Both would later prove to be my strongest inner instincts, though, I also found, they were no guarantor of success.
I was the third of four sons, and we were born in couplets. The elder pair, Marvin and Norman (in that order), were born in the 1920s with their names reflecting a more traditional world. Seven years elapsed before I came along, followed 21 months later by brother Paul, our names reflecting perhaps a tilt toward modernity. Marv and Norman, perceived by us in those early years as much older, went off to serve in the armed forces during World War II. Paul and I, closer in age, shared more of life’s experiences. We were first generation Americans. I had no idea that this was a significant demographic until decades later. We were American as apple pie, strongly patriotic—and poor. We were, after all, in the middle of the Great Depression. But that characteristic was common to everyone we knew. My mother’s maiden name was Frieda Sylvia Goruch. Born in 1901, she was second eldest of four daughters and a son, born to Abraham and Rebecca Goruch (or Goruchovsky before it was anglicized). She lived in a shtetl just outside of Kiev in what is now Ukraine, but was then under Russian rule. Jews weren’t allowed to live within the boundaries of Kiev proper. She used to tell us that the floor of their home was bare earth. Everyone had a trade in the shtetls of the time, and my maternal grandfather (born in 1875) made his living as a tailor.
Pogroms were deadly and feared by the shtetl populations of Eastern Europe during those terrible years, particularly from 1880 through 1914 when anti-Semitism raged throughout the Russian Empire. It seemed that much of the blame for all the troubles of society was laid at the feet of the already ostracized Jews, and it would only get worse unless they found a way out of there. Ukrainian Russia, where my family lived, was somehow a particular hotbed for government-sanctioned pogroms, though the Czar vehemently denied any role on his part.
One fateful day in 1911 my mother’s settlement was attacked by marauding Russian Cossacks on horseback, one swooping in to assault my grandfather, then 33, and his family. Putting his family behind him, my grandfather ran forward to intercept the rider and threw him from his horse. Since resistance was not tolerated, my grandfather had to leave his family following the altercation and flee for his life! With the parting words, “I will get you out!” he made his way to Hamburg where he hid in a lifeboat on an ocean liner bound for New Orleans. Once there, he slipped off the ship and managed to follow the Mississippi River north up to St. Louis where other immigrants he knew had settled, including (helpfully) his father, who had peacefully, to use the word loosely, emigrated there in January 1909.
There were, of course, many other European immigrant groups in that era who were escaping from very difficult circumstances, but few who feared daily for their very safety as did the Jews of the time. In the case of my grandfather, it’s accurate to say that he was one of America’s early undocumented aliens. The memory of his story is seared into my conscience and unceasingly reminds me of my own personal commitment to supporting a proper solution to a significant item of America’s unfinished business—the plight of America’s current crop of undocumented aliens. It should be easily understood that the punishing experience of the Jewish Diaspora over two millennia has forged into the DNA of successive generations of Jews, down to the present one, a sensitivity to the plight of the downtrodden and a yearning for a just society. As events will bear out in this personal account, it is certainly there in mine, as imperfect in its expression as my fettered humanity has allowed. But it is unmistakably there. What America, cloaked in an ever struggling exceptionalism, so importantly adds to the mix is a unique collection of governance values—an exciting infusion of profound democratic community—that offers a realistic hope of perfecting such a society in the fullness of time.
In the old immigrant neighborhoods of St. Louis, my grandfather, resolutely trying to find his way, found an abandoned storefront on 6th Street which, as luck would have it, contained a scrapped sign in the back that read, “Buck the Tailor.” So, with that welcoming token bestowed no doubt by his guardian angels (whose work was pretty good so far), my brave and embattled grandfather became Buck the Tailor! He saved his nickels and dimes for two years at the trade he knew, and then sent for his family who had been holding their own with the help of friends and extended family on the outskirts of Kiev.
My grandmother’s family, and her sister’s family as well, eleven strong (six Goruchovsky’s and five Kranitzky’s) arrived in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on January 13, 1913. The Canadian Pacific Railroad then ushered them down to Detroit where they were admitted into the United States, finally, feeling absolutely incredulous over what was happening in their lives. Immigration officials, as they did with so many of the European unpronounceables, shortened my grandmother’s name from Goruchovsky to Goruch and her sister’s name from Kranitzky to Crane. They then traveled overland to St. Louis—my mother was 12—where they had a joyous reunion with my grandfather who, then, impatiently escorted them to his tailor shop where they would live for a time. It had a wooden floor! Happily re-unified, the family continued its struggle for survival, but at least in freedom in this new world of theirs—no small consideration if one stops to think about it, and, as I came to believe, one that we take for granted at our peril.
Many decades later, I had a consulting assignment in Kiev. Our threesome hailed a taxi and went to visit the Babi Yar Memorial, a ravine on the outskirts of the city. It was there that the Nazis, in their war against the Soviet Union, rounded up all the Jews in the Kiev region for what they said was transportation to another holding area. Then they were told to dig further into the ravine. Over the next two days, September 29th and 30th 1941, in a ruthless operation, Nazi Sonderkommandos murdered all 33,771 Jews who were gathered there—men, women, and children. It was one of the largest single massacres in the history of the Holocaust. Other later victims at the site included thousands of Soviet POWs, communists, Gypsies, Ukrainian nationalists, and civilian hostages. Estimates are that 100,000 to 150,000 lives were taken in that ravine.
I stood there looking at it, next to the memorial, in utter disbelief, trying to conjure up the abject terror that had been experienced there and which has become a bitter lesson in the failures of humanity. I was gripped by a realization, known casually as just family history before, but shockingly thrust into my consciousness in that moment: My mother and her family would have been totally wiped out in 1941 in that ravine had my grandfather not escaped himself and sent for them 28 years earlier. Maybe my father’s family as well. We knew the stories, but standing there right in the middle of the reality of it all was overwhelming. Why do some live and some die? It reinforced my deeply felt curiosity about such bewildering issues which had plagued me for years . . . and still do.
My father, Benjamin Jacob Schramm, was born in 1899 in Volhynia Gaberna, located maybe 175 miles west of Kiev in the northwest sector of present-day Ukraine. In alternating periods of time a part of Poland, Prussia, Austria, or Russia, it belonged to the Russian Empire when my father came onto the scene.
Second eldest of four children, my father was the only boy. The anglicized names of his parents were Frank and Ida Schramm. My paternal grandfather was born about 1870 and was a Talmud teacher and scholar. Interestingly, the name Schramm is a fairly common German name. German emigration to Volhynia Gaberna, mostly from Poland but also from some German provinces, grew to a population estimated at some 200,000 by the turn of the century. So somewhere down the line, my father’s forbears took on the same name of their Christian German neighbors—probably their landowners, in much the same way, I would guess, an African American bore the name of his ancestors’ slave owners. But conditions of the Volhynian Germans began to deteriorate in the late 19th century and thousand began to emigrate to both the United States and Canada.
My paternal grandfather, like so many of his Volhynian German neighbors, took his family and emigrated to America in 1905, and made their way to St. Louis also. My father was just six. Once in St. Louis, my grandparents on both sides, still unknown to one another, settled into life—the Goruches (my grandfather finally succumbed to the practicalities of this shortened version) on Carr Street and the Schramms in a nearby neighborhood—in what is now downtown St. Louis. This is the area where most of the Eastern European immigrants gathered. Some called it a Jewish ghetto, not unlike the living habits that had been forced upon them for centuries in the shtetls of the Eastern European diaspora. It was a mutual protection and comfort thing.
My father was a good student, especially in math, and made it through the eighth grade. My mother went through the fifth grade, and left school to help out at home. A love of music, and an aptitude for its expression led my father to violin lessons. He developed a real flair for technique but his passion was especially evident as he pursed his lips and leaned forward, his body and bow arm in rhythmic synchronicity, surging from dulcet to brio on both instrument and brow, as he transited the emotional phrasing in a sweeping melody of Tchaikovsky or Beethoven. My father was in charge and ecstatic when he was doing his music—his thing. It showed on his face. It was good to see, as he didn’t have that kind of happiness—in a protracted sense—as the years wore on.
The early years were better and more promising. It was inevitable that my father would become a professional musician—and an accomplished one. Professional opportunities began to come, and he found himself organizing and leading small groups of musicians for weddings and other functions.
As he broke into his twenties, buoyed by his music and feeling lighthearted, he was emboldened to turn to matters of the heart. He met Frieda Goruch, a beautiful young girl with a pug nose and regular Slavic-like features. She agreed to accompany him on some of his playing engagements, sitting off to the side and proudly watching her boyfriend entertain all those strangers. It was kind of exciting for them both. Unable to deny their love for each other, they married in 1920—he was 21 and she 19. Thus began the tumultuous life of Ben and Frieda Schramm.
Marvin arrived in 1922 and Norman in 1924. The Roaring 20’s was a time of opportunity for musicians, perhaps the most successful time of my father’s life, as he was engaged to play dinner music at the (still) fashionable Chase Hotel. A large black sign with silver glitter letters reading “Ben Schramm and his Orchestra” hung over the stage—and he kept that sign for all the ensuing decades of his life in a closet wherever he lived.
In 1927, and feeling ready, my parents emigrated from the City of St. Louis to the County of St. Louis (two different jurisdictions). They wanted to be where the rest of the Jewish community was moving—into the adjoining suburb of University City (so named because it abutted Washington University in St. Louis and many of its streets were named for universities: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, Tulane, Colgate, Dartmouth, the more prominent ones). The family lived in three apartments over the next nine years. The stock market crashed in 1929 and the depression had engulfed everyone.
My father’s music business crashed, too. He tried to open up a dry cleaning business, but he refused to pay protection to the mob—so they threw a bomb through his window and that ended that. My mother thought she had to do something to earn some money, so she bought some hosiery and underwear at discount prices and then sold them to the employees at several hotels who agreed to the purchases if they could pay for them a little each week. So she marked up the articles and sold them at a profit. She began regular collections for these sales. And her business grew to include furniture and appliances and a retail store owner backed her with merchandise.
Her customers were all in the black community, and this kind of arrangement was the only way they could afford those necessities. She was trailblazing, one could argue, the credit card economy we have today. She didn’t know it, but she also had started the feminist movement.
As my mother was getting underway in her business, we moved to our fourth apartment in 1936. I was four. All of these apartments were located in an area called the Delmar Loop, so named because it was the streetcar turnaround for the westernmost reach of the then ‘mass transit’ system of St. Louis. Our new apartment was a third floor walkup at 6319 Delmar Boulevard, right on the main drag. The Loop was U. City’s business district and stretched for about eight blocks beyond the city line.
At the far end of the business district was Delmar-Harvard Grade School (at the corner of Delmar and Harvard Avenue), where brother Paul and I attended grade school. My political career started in kindergarten where my teachers (Miss Olmstead and Miss Iseley—I’ll never forget them) appointed me the fire chief of a red fire wagon that we had built. I remember being surprised. From humble beginnings and all that . . . .
Times were still tough for everyone in the Loop. FDR and the federal government created the Works Progress Administration (or WPA as it was popularly known) in 1935 to preserve the skills and self-respect of the working people of America. It lasted until 1943. They did everything—from infrastructure to the arts. It included the creation of the WPA symphony orchestra that played every week in University City’s Heman Park. My father signed up as a violinist, as did many of his musician friends. We frequently went to listen to the orchestra on a summer evening. My father earned about $90.00 a month, which helped with the rent, while my mother earned the grocery money.
We lived in that Delmar apartment all the way through my first year of law school. It was home. Early on, my mother’s credit business attracted other entrants—all men. About a dozen of them banded together, along with my mother (the only woman), to pool their purchasing power so that they could buy their merchandise at favorable prices. Mom held her own with the men—and her boys were proud of her, though we didn’t quite realize how extraordinary she was. The family members—all of us—just forged ahead with our lives. And enjoyed the dinners she cooked for us every evening, which we just took for granted.
My father never seemed to be able to get a toehold in business, and tried several ventures into the 1940’s. He was an artist, not a businessman, and seemed very unhappy most of the time. He was able to join several community orchestras, the first in University City and the second in Kirkwood (another suburb), and I truly think those were lifesavers for him.
One day when I was about 10, I got a look at life in the raw. My mother hired one of her customers, Margaret, to clean the house once a week to pick up the slack for her. Margaret was like one of the family. On a warm sunny day, Margaret asked if I would like a root beer—a real treat because I knew it meant going down the street to visit Blondie & Dick’s Root Beer Stand, an outdoor arrangement vividly painted in orange and black, and extremely popular in the Loop. We were seated at the bar and there were no other customers. Margaret paid for a large mug and I chugged most of it down but couldn’t finish it, so I passed it over to Margaret and asked her to finish it for me. She smiled, put the mug to her lips, and no sooner had she done that, when Blondie appeared—she startled me—and snatched the mug right out of Margaret’s hands, saying, “Sorry!”
I was only a little guy, but I was dumbstruck! I knew what had happened but could hardly believe it. Margaret was denied service by Blondie because, and only because, she was black (“African American” wasn’t in vogue yet). Margaret was hurt. I could tell it, but she held onto her dignity. I hurt, too, for Margaret, and was so very embarrassed. It just wasn’t right, I remembered thinking. We walked home in silence, but that scene remained with me throughout my life, and has informed my conscience on matters of race whenever it was in my power to do something about it. I didn’t yet know what politics was about but I believe we all face character-building moments, as this one was for me, and we either experience some kind of propulsion within us that directs us to want to make change, or we don’t. Whoever is in charge of imprinting consciences found an easy mark in me.
Little by little I began to develop a notion about how people should treat one another. I was a bit shy and serious—but proud. Not flashy or show-offy proud. But I wanted to be upstanding and didn’t want to be criticized for not doing the right thing. I then had a personal experience as a youngster that challenged my self-righteousness, if I can call it that. Every Jewish kid in my generation experienced prejudice at one time or another. Every one.
On one occasion, I was forced into a physical fight—the only one I ever had. I was only about 11. About five neighbor kids, including my brother Paul and me, went over to have some fun at an abandoned construction site nearby. We weren’t there five minutes when five older boys suddenly appeared; they were from nearby Christ the King parochial school, who were notorious for seeking out “Jew-boy Christ-killers” and beating them up. They let it be known that we were their targets. Our little group fled wildly down the hill—except me. I was too proud to run, though I don’t know what came over me. I just stood there frozen to the ground. Brother Paul was frantically calling to me to run.
The bullies selected one of their number to do the honors. Meanwhile, Paul and the other kids ran home and screamed at my brother Norman (who was 17 or 18) ‘to come rescue Jack who was getting beaten up.’ Norm rushed back with the other kids, and we were still grappling. But Norman was the equalizer and, for the sake of everyone’s pride, I guess it was, wisely asked if we wanted to fight it out, and we both nodded yes, almost automatically. To tell the truth, I wasn’t so sure. But, knowing it would now be a fair fight, and the others wouldn’t pile on, I was energized and became very aggressive, slugging the guy. After a bit, I yelled, “Tell me when you’ve had enough!” And he finally did. The bullies made a fast exit, and I remember the triumphant walk home, Norman, with his arm around my shoulder, beaming down at his little brother.
The ferocity of anti-Semitism has moderated with the passing of each generation—from the shtetls and Holocaust of my grandparents’ and parents’ time, to the present where it is certainly the case that our children have been less exposed to this mindless hatred. But it’s still out there, perhaps worse in the subtler (and sometimes not so subtle) expressions of racial bias experienced by African Americans. And today the LGBT community and Latinos are experiencing some of the same kinds of senseless hatred that stands in the way of love and acceptance of our fellow human beings. Although, over time, we assuredly have done better, we should hope that the trajectory improves.
So, if one is born into a cauldron of “them” and “us,” attitudes are shaped. Certainly mine were shaped—as one of “them”—by personally witnessing and experiencing, even at a tender age, the callousness of hatred, the damage it inflicts, and the sorrow it leaves behind. I cannot square it with any concept of cosmic morality that I have encountered. Others may be born into, and come to identify with a culture of “us vs. them.” It must be very difficult to wrest one’s mind from this kind of negativity and the divisiveness that those influences tend to weave into one’s DNA. The struggle between these two forces has been played out in America since our beginnings as we try to “form a more perfect union.” I happen to believe that the expansion of personal liberties will continue, but those of like mind will need to persevere to make it happen.
Nowadays the “other side,” to put it gently, is more sophisticated in its discrimination. It couches its lack of concern for “them” in the polemics of such phantoms as fear of takeover (reflected in restrictive immigration policy and absence of gun control), fear of abuse (reflected in hobbled voting rights ), Biblical injunction (reflected in restraints on LGBT rights, women’s rights), big government intrusiveness (reflected in seeking an unshackling from economic, environmental, and all manner of regulation), and constitutional exhortation (using the Constitution to restrict rather than enlarge rights—such as using the 10th Amendment ‘powers reserved to the states’ clause to de-fang Federal jurisdiction or the 14th Amendment ‘due process’ clause to undo abortion rights).
TWO
Political Nascence: The Fledgling Years
S
EVERAL YEARS AGO when I joined my classmates in St. Louis for the 50th reunion of our graduation from the Washington University School of Law, we were asked to explain the circumstances surrounding our decision to study law and what our legal careers were all about. When my turn came, I said I had wanted to become a lawyer since the age of 12, but that my principal motivation was not so much to practice but rather to make law. I didn’t know where that came from, I joked, unless I had been in the Roman Senate in a previous life. The way politics gripped my life throughout my school years, and ineluctably directed me toward politics later, has made me wonder where in the world that inner drive and motivation truly came from.
Even in my neighborhood growing up, and still in grade school, I seemed to have had a penchant for organizing things. It wasn’t anything special, and I didn’t attach any significance to it. I suggested stuff and the kids just followed along. For example, I organized a “Bike Patrol,” looking for I don’t know what, evil-doers, I suppose. Also an “army” of 12 young stalwarts—and I was the general, of course. This was during World War II and we even did hikes as training maneuvers and “played guns.” The NRA would have been proud! Probably the most fun was the cork ball league I organized where St. Louis kids (it’s the only place it’s played) learned to hit lightning fast balls and curves, thrown with a tennis ball, with a sawed-off broomstick. And that morphed into a fast pitch baseball team that I organized to play against other neighborhood teams, all before we were in high school. We used to create our own amusements as there were no professional youth organizers or clubs in the 1940s.
My 7th to 9th grade happened at Ward Junior High School. As we reached the end of the 8th grade and the election of next year’s student council president loomed, I found myself a candidate, at the behest of some friends. It was 1945 and the world was consumed by the prospect of World War II coming to an end. The surrender of Germany and Japan (the latter prompted by the use of atomic weapons) was only a few months off. So in my speech to the student body, I spoke of the scourge of war and how we had to be steadfast in the face of its challenges. Never mind what I would do for the school, if elected. I was only 13, had just been bar mitzvahed a few months earlier and obviously had taken the Hebrew injunction of Tikun Olam (Repair the World) perhaps too seriously, for this election anyway. But so it would be for the rest of my life. Well, I won the election (my first), and I was teasingly reminded of that speech by classmates as many as 30 years later! In this, I learned that if you can’t do relevance, memorable is good!
The next phase of my busy life took place at University City Senior High School. From ages 15 through 17, everything was new and wonderful, and included sports, fraternities, dating, and school politics, too. Sports, especially, consumed me. I was good at baseball and lettered in all three of my high school years. I also played American Legion baseball and in summer industrial leagues—with and against players who went to the major leagues.
Then there were clubs, the school newspaper, and, of course, the student council. My home room class elected me to the student council in the 10th grade. I worked hard in my studies and became a self-starter as I knew help from home was unlikely. Academically, I was above average and finally made the honor roll in my last couple of semesters. Grades were truly earned in those days the hard way.
The end of the 11th grade came and, with it, campaign time for the office of student body president for our senior year. Or, to be more precise, for the first half of our senior year; the school administration thought it best to share this school honor between two students, one for each semester. Again, friends urged me to run. I would never have run without their encouragement, as my shy self would have thought it too presumptuous to run otherwise. Election day came and we gave our speeches. I don’t remember what I said, but I won (or maybe my campaign manager, Chuck Walker, won; he gave a very entertaining speech). So, on this one, I learned that if you can’t do substance, entertainment is good!
Senior year came, and it was an exciting one. Presiding over the student council and its work, chair of the Junior-Senior Prom Committee, I was also selected (I don’t remember how) to be Mayor of University City for a Day. I continued to take everything seriously. One day, Miss Briscoe, our student council faculty sponsor, gently nudged me not to overdo it by saying, “Jack, I heard one girl say that she would love it if you would just smile!” Notwithstanding, in the final tallies for senior class ‘most this and that,’ Dick Dutton, student body president in the second semester, and I tied as “Most Popular Boy.” So maybe it was okay to be serious-minded!
Of course, during senior year, the thoughts of almost all of my classmates turned to college—where would we go? U. City High School had developed a sterling reputation in the university community as among the best high schools in St. Louis County—and there were dozens. About 90% of its graduates went on to college. Everyone was expected to. Most of us were first generation Americans and “People of the Book,” and we knew that education was a path to the American dream. It was 1949. The Great Depression and World War II both had ended, and I instinctively felt that education would help me accomplish things that were beginning to stir deeply within me. For those of us living in the Delmar Loop especially, we couldn’t wait to get started.
Since Princeton and Harvard took our academic stars, it was hard for me not to dream, too, about going to an Eastern college. My family certainly could not afford it. So while I was awaiting some celestial guidance, the admissions dean from Colgate University in Hamilton, New York decided to visit our high school for the first time, based on our reputation. I attended—and was hooked by pictures of the beautiful campus in a small town, an all-male student body of only 1,300, the core curriculum of philosophy and religion, public affairs, the study of an alternative culture, but mostly by the prospect of joining the Washington Study Group for a semester of studying the federal government right there in its offices. Though it was late in the season, I sent for an application and, shortly thereafter, was contacted by Tom DePew, Colgate’s college advisor for St. Louis. We hit it off famously. A successful businessman, Tom always wanted to help deserving people, often saying to me throughout the course of a lifelong friendship, “We’ve got to help them, Jack!” I didn’t realize at the time that I was one of his early projects. He proved to be one of the most decent people I have ever known.
I needed a scholarship and Tom went to bat for me to be sure I received one. What I didn’t know until well after I had graduated was that I had applied too late for financial aid for my freshman year, and that Tom had arranged with the school to pay for my freshman year himself. He really wanted me to go to Colgate! (I have since established a scholarship at Colgate as a way of repaying Tom’s poignant and indelible kindness.) My record after my first year persuaded Colgate, going forward, to cover my annual tuition and provide work in the library and dining facilities to defray room and board. This amounted to two-thirds of the cost of attending, or $1,600.00 per year. My parents footed the remaining third, or $800.00. How things have changed, as fellow parents will attest!
My freshman year at Colgate was exciting. I made lots of friends, pledged Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, one of the more popular ones, and in contravention of its ‘only for Christians’ clause. Again, I was asked to run for freshman class president by friends. As I recall, my speech was about how all of us should receive invitations to the fraternities, as Princeton had done for its eating clubs, because those who were left out (about 15% of the class) truly missed an important social dimension offered by the college. The idea was that if one was good enough to be admitted to the college, he was good enough to be admitted to a fraternity. I won the election. It was then that I knew I would be elected Student Senate president for my senior year. And that’s what happened. It was a strange feeling because it was almost as if I could will my success in these elections. My arrogance would get its comeuppance as time went on, but I was feeling my oats at the time.
My life at Colgate was truly fulfilling. After the freshman class presidency, my fraternity thought I should represent it in the Student Senate, which served only to whet my appetite for more. “Politics” is the word commonly used to describe this kind of activity, but I didn’t use the term. I thought it was much more like a responsibility that one should exercise on behalf of one’s fellows. I was still possessed of that serious and very idealistic turn of mind. After my sophomore year, I won a scholarship from the Experiment in International Living to spend the summer in Morelia, Mexico living with a Mexican family, where I soaked up the culture and language, and broadened my vistas. With courses in International Law and International Organization, I was really getting turned on to the international scene.
During my junior year, my international affairs professor, Dr. Robert Elder, had me appointed to two inter-collegiate positions that would further excite my interest in international policy. The first was as president of the Upstate New York Model United Nations Security Council, comprised of eleven regional universities, which I found intriguing. The second appointment, somewhat more challenging, was as a Main Committee chair at meetings of the Mid-Atlantic Model United Nations General Assembly being held, of all places, at the United Nations Building in New York City. Well, let me tell you—how could a young person not be impressed by conducting even faux UN business in the ECOSOC Chamber itself!
Apparently I was not so bad at doing presiding officer stuff because, at the close of our three day meetings, and in the session where the participants (representing some 60 colleges and universities from the Mid-Atlantic states) were to select the presiding officers for the following year’s session, I was elected to serve as president of the General Assembly. Again, I thought to myself, what is going on here?
Back at Colgate, at the end of my junior year, I was elected student body president and presided over the Student Senate for the first semester of my senior year, but had to turn the gavel over to the vice president (Vail Taylor, a wonderful and deservedly well-respected guy) in the second semester so I could spend that semester in Washington, D.C. with the Washington Study Group. But I had an insight during a philosophy course with Dr. Holmes Hartshorne during that first semester that has remained with me throughout my political life. Dr. Hartshorne explained the American political experience as a national commitment to the autonomous individual. “Well, what does that mean,” he probed?
“Autonomous,” he explained, “derives from two Greek words: ‘autos’ meaning self and ‘nomos’ meaning reason or order. Thus, the self-reasoning or self-ordered individual.”
Then Dr. Hartshorne went on to apply this fundamental concept to our political parties. “The Republicans,” he explained, “emphasize the ‘autos’ or self and are identified with free private enterprise, the values of liberty, and untrammeled, to the extent possible, individual expression. And, for their part, Democrats emphasize the ‘nomos’ and thus are more identified with the reasonable use of government to achieve order and social welfare, emphasizing the equality of individuals in the process. But each carries the seeds and values of the other so that they both can lay claim to a commitment to the autonomous individual. Thus, while Republicans want to reduce regulation and allow Wall Street and the banks to exercise their financial and business creativity for the benefit of all, they would be hesitant to overturn the ‘nomos’ dimension of the equation as represented by Social Security or perhaps other social measures.”
“And the Democrats,” Dr. Hartshorne continued, “although fully committed to the beneficial uses of government as reflected in the ‘nomos’ dimension of this equation, are at the same time committed to the private enterprise system, liberty, and private expression as reflected in the ‘autos,’ perhaps not as ardently as the Republicans, but it is a strongly shared value nonetheless.”
That little insight, as explained by Dr. Hartshorne, was an epiphany for me, and I have carried those words with me throughout my life. They are a great summary of American political life. To me, they mean that we are a nation of shared values. There is more that unites us than divides us. Our differences are a matter of degree. The American political process of transparency and openly debating our differences is designed to allow us to glimpse what the other guy is thinking, to understand it even if we don’t agree with it, and to work to resolve our differences in a peaceful way. The “autonomous individual”—this way of thinking about who we are—is a notion that encapsulates our common worth and has always brought us together in times of national stress. It has kept me sane.
My final semester in Washington, D.C. was a memorable experience! We were ten students, both seniors and juniors, and, as it happened, split down the middle politically—five Republicans and five Democrats. By this time, I knew that my heart was firmly planted on the Democratic side of the aisle. I was able to sharpen my debating skills as we argued all the time, even on the trolley every morning as we headed up to the Capitol from the YMCA where we stayed. That was my first taste of anyone daring to articulate to my face a difference with the way I saw the world! I was comfortable with my views and initially wondered how in the world they—my classmates—could come to such different conclusions. Didn’t we have the same facts and concerns? Well, needless to say, I got quite an education in public policy from my Republican friends. A shot across my naïve bow! What a politically sheltered life I had led!
It was 1953 and Dwight Eisenhower was president, having defeated Adlai Stevenson—such a refined, intelligent fellow, I remember musing—the year before. The semester was eye-opening at so many levels—from a visit in the White House to interview Ike’s press secretary; to a personal interview with Vice President Richard Nixon; to a period of study in the State Department (as a group) and then the Department of Labor (we each had to choose an agency); and, finally, in connection with our study of Congress, its members, and the legislative process, to some three weeks or so as an intern in our own congressman’s office—mine was Representative Tom Curtis, a Republican representing the greater part of St. Louis County. I remember thinking to myself that, someday, I would run for that selfsame seat—and I did some 23 years later, in 1976. Clearly, by this time, I had an undeniable feeling that politics was to be my calling.
Midway through the semester, Dr. Elder and I took a long weekend off to head to Ithaca, N.Y, where I was to assume my responsibilities as President of the Mid-Atlantic Model UN General Assembly. It was to convene at the Cornell Law School. I worked closely, and also shared a dormitory room, with Peter Kenen, a Columbia University student who had been selected to be the Secretary-General. I addressed him as “Peter” and he addressed me as “Your Excellency.” Peter was brilliant and played his role to the hilt. He later received his doctorate at Harvard and, from 1971 through 2004, was the Walker Professor of Economics and International Finance at Princeton and became internationally renowned.
By that time, I had presided over so many student groups that I remember having felt fairly confident and comfortable in managing the flow of debate and occasionally interceding to push along the resolution of an issue. It was a confidence-builder for me and a very satisfying learning experience. When we were packing up to go home following a crowded few days of international problem-solving with wonderfully creative peers—we all wished that we could have had a real go at these issues—Dr. Elder, with whom I had developed a warm relationship, privately whispered to me, “Jack, when you get into this work for real, don’t forget to contact me for consulting purposes!” Given the knowledge imbalance between my professor and me, that he would suggest that I hire him some day—did I really hear what I heard? Though stunned, I was secretly very pleased with what I was doing to warrant Dr. Elder’s confidence.
Dr. Elder and I returned to the program in Washington, concluded our semester’s work in May, and returned to campus to prepare for graduation for those of us who were seniors. I finished my academics with a deep major in political science and two minors—one in philosophy and one in Spanish, both of which I truly relished. I sat with the political science faculty for the departmental honors exam, a daunting exercise! My GPA put me in the top 10% of my class which qualified me for the honors exam with cum laude standing. It could have been magna but for a few C’s in my first couple of semesters while I was learning how to study at the college level. A leak that a faculty friend coaxed out of several political science faculty colleagues revealed to our collective glee that my oral exam was of high honors caliber. But I was delighted, after all was said and done, to graduate Cum Laude with Honors in Political Science from a place like Colgate; I also felt honored to have been admitted to both the junior and senior honorary societies and to have been awarded a George W. Cobb Fellowship for leadership. More than delighted for a boy from the Delmar Loop.
THREE
The Influences of Law School and Military Service
I
WAS ADMITTED TO the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis where I began my first year of legal studies in the Fall of 1953. I lived at home in the Loop, could walk to classes, and had a scholarship loan from the St. Louis Scholarship Foundation. It was good not to be a further financial burden to my parents, who were busy helping my brother Paul through undergraduate school, and later law school, at the University of Missouri-Columbia, some 120 miles away. To have the credential—a law degree—was an enthralling prospect for me.
What a budding lawyer learns from the very beginning is the necessity of finding the core issue of a problem at the very outset of a dispute, how to express it and be right about it. It is necessary in this kind of analysis to put aside any coloration of the issue, whether based in emotion or philosophy, and see it as it is—the reality of the matter in the bright light of day. Being clear-eyed about a problem’s core issues and dimensions is the sine qua non to its satisfactory resolution. Resorting to morality and philosophy are fine when addressing the resolution question, but it is imperative to be realistic about the fundamental problem you are faced with.
I have always felt that the study of the law was an excellent preparation for a career in politics or in the development or execution of public policy. To be sure, one can learn to be an effective public practitioner through other professional disciplines, but, at least in my opinion, the best preparation for a socio-legal gap analysis and the application of an apt legislative solution is legal training. I hasten to add, however, that I think it would be a mistake to have a legislative body solely comprised of lawyers. A policy-making body benefits from a wide range of life experiences. For me and my inclinations though, I was satisfied that legal training would best equip me for public policy analysis and leadership.
We learned all about research methods and how to use the library in that first year. We didn’t have computers then and no access to lightning fast answers to majority and minority rules in any given jurisdiction. Instead we plowed through the books, took copious notes on what we found, painstakingly “shepardized” our cases, as we called it, to ensure that their holdings had not been later overruled or amended, and then laboriously hunt-and-pecked on our old typewriters to complete our research papers.
Well into my second semester, I started to think hard about the final two years of law school, and especially about the prospect of piling up further debt through the scholarship loan, which was still available to me. The GI Bill was another option open to me but only for a few more months since the Korean War was in the process of officially winding down in 1954. I decided to go for it. I kept my own counsel in this process, as I did for most things—master of my own fate kind of thing. This was characteristic of all of my collegiate decision-making, and truly felt throughout my life that I was the one, the only one, really in charge of my destiny. Not to be too dramatic about it, but I felt that I was the one to take my fate—my own fate—into my own hands, that no one could do for me what I was supposed to do for myself.
Truth be told, I had something of an adventurous streak within me. It was related to my natural curiosity and extended to unknown things, places, and experiences, sort of a fascination with things beyond my ken. This curiosity about the unknown later led me to spiritual places that helped me come to terms with my place in the world, and to accept both my disappointments and successes with equanimity—a sense of balance and calm.
In that broader connection, I always both admired and envied my genius nephew, David Schramm (a 6’4” red-headed giant of a man and eldest son of brother Marvin), who was short-listed for a Nobel in astrophysics before his untimely accidental death in 1997 at the age of 52, flying his own plane (having picked up the love of flying airplanes from his father). A physical as well as an intellectual adventurer, Dave climbed mountains on every continent, except Antarctica, despite having several near-death experiences. He learned the rough and tumble side of life as an all-state wrestler as a Missouri high school senior and as a New England heavyweight wrestling champion when he was at MIT. Nearly made the Olympic team, too.
In his other life, David, former chairman of the Department of Astrophysics at the University of Chicago and manager of the Fermilab there, and ever the adventurer, aggressively plumbed the depths of the cosmos, and its Black Holes. In that pursuit, he did much to unite cosmic mysteries with those of particle physics, and found, in this unity, a greater understanding of the Big Bang of creation and the now accepted concept of an ever-expanding universe that followed.
A New York Times remembrance essay by Dennis Overbye following Dave’s death reported that the science community was stunned “that a man described as a force of nature could be gone.” Added British theoretical physicist Stephen W. Hawking, for whom Dave served as best man at his wedding, “. . . David was larger than life in so many ways.” David was looking for ultimate answers—the biggest “why” of all. I am sure that in the quiet confines of his lab, he had an “aha” moment or two, and I would so much like to have seen what Dave saw. I have often wondered if, as the poet John Magee said, he had “touched the face of God.” Doubtless, he has the answers now—and so will we all, some day.
I don’t know if there is an “adventure” gene in some members of the Schramm clan or not (although, in retrospect, as I look at my brothers and some of their offspring, and my own, I might perhaps be persuaded!). Be that as it may, as I stood there in 1954 facing whatever the future held for me, I didn’t know, nor could I, what astonishing dimensions my life would assume in the next few years.
My peers and I had registered for the draft each year beginning at age 18, and those of us in college, like me, had received deferments. So, having decided to take the plunge, I volunteered for the draft, as the procedure was called, and found myself being sworn into the army as a recruit on August 30, 1954. I was 22.
Off they sent me to Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, where I endured eight weeks of basic training, followed by another eight weeks of field artillery training. There, I learned to fire and clean all manner of firearms. Those drill sergeants were a breed apart, but I learned an unforgettable life lesson from their often raging, if not bullying, insistence on just about everything—that “there are no excuses; just get the job done, dammit!” The phrase clearly suits the military mission, but is not bad for the rest of us, too. Like most young people, I had often found a reason to put something off. Thereafter, however, I heard the demands of my drill sergeants ringing in my ears, making me feel compulsive at times.
And, when Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, published her book Lean In in 2012 urging that women take charge of their own lives and, as part of her charge, advising them (and everyone else, for that matter) to “relentlessly prioritize,” I felt an instant resonating connection between her call for urgency in the workplace and that demanded by my drill sergeants, both urging execution and achievement in the face of difficult tasks to be accomplished. Good lessons find ways to reinforce themselves.
Thus, I reconciled the seeming competition between my astrological predilections: Capricorn’s impulse to get the lead out is given direction by my Aquarian why-and-wherefore inquiries to get the humanitarian policy focus right. I’ve always been comfortable with that personality setting.
We were all then to be shipped off for further training, but we had some say-so in the matter. One of the options was to go airborne—strictly for volunteers. I thought that if I had to go into combat, I wanted to be with folks who were better trained for it and good warriors. And then, the adventure streak kicked in, and the thought that followed was that this could really be interesting and challenging and maybe even fun. So, without pondering it further, I volunteered, and was promptly shipped off to the 11th Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, not quite knowing what to expect. The paratroopers there made an immediate impression on me. For one thing, they seemed bigger; for another, their fatigues were starched, pressed, and spotless, and their bloused boots were polished like a mirror. These guys were proud. I liked that.
After processing, I was assigned to the 675 Airborne Field Artillery Battalion, and my company commander was 1st Lt. “Tiger” Jones who virtually growled his orders. His top sergeant was Sgt. DeLaskey whose face looked like my boxer, but who had a gentler side, I later discovered, which he kept well hidden. This was to be my home unit at Fort Campbell, but the first order of business was our airborne training. Actually, the first order of business was PT—physical training. It preceded everything an airborne unit did. We ran for miles at a time, often to a rhythmic cadence sounded off by our trainers. We did hundreds of pushups in a day, usually 20 at a time, interspersed with other forms of calisthenics. We did palms-out pullups, which I had never been able to do before. If a guy was out of sync in an exercise count, he was immediately identified and an order crisply issued, “Drop for 20, soldier!”
What I truly admired and will never forget is the time when the drill sergeant, who was up on a platform and doing all of the calisthenics with us, screwed up his own count, and volunteered, “My mistake! At ease! I will drop for 20,” at which point he dropped to do 20 pushups while the rest of us stood in formation, feet spread, hands clasped behind our backs, watching in stony silence—and with utter respect. If one ever had cause to wonder how these elite units develop such camaraderie and self-sacrifice in their ranks, this is one small illustration. With this physical routine every day, I never harbored any doubt that this was the best physical shape I had ever been in either before or since that time.
Doubtless, the most gratifying consequence of my assignment to this unit was meeting Bill Claggett. Bill had been in the service three or four months longer than I, had been earlier discovered by Sgt. DeLaskey and worked for him as the battery clerk. Bill, from Dayton, Ohio, had two Harvard degrees in city planning and was later to have a great career as a government advisor, professor, and consultant. Bill and I grew close as brothers and became lifelong friends.
Our airborne training proceeded apace. We practiced Parachute Landing Falls—PLFs as we called them—jumping hundreds of times from four foot platforms, learning how to distribute our weight as we hit the ground. Then they had a contraption about three stories high, sort of like a fire tower, where you strapped yourself into a parachute harness with lines attached to a cable above, waited for a jump command, and then threw yourself out of the door trying to keep a tight body position as you were sharply caught by the cable above and your legs fought the restraining harness that wanted to wrench them outward, all the while being zip-wired down to an end-point about fifty yards off.
The idea was to teach us, upon exiting an airplane, to maintain a tight body position—head down, arms clutching your reserve chute below your chest with your right palm over the D-ring, and legs bent slightly but absolutely together—no matter what air pressures were attempting to drive your members apart. If you couldn’t keep your legs together when jumping the tower—and it hurt to do so—then you had to do the tower way more than you wanted to.
After weeks of PT and jump school practice, we finally reached show time—an actual jump. I kept a Jump Log for all sixteen jumps that I made in the service, which identified the date, the drop zone, my stick position, the type of jump, and remarks about any unique features of the jump. All troopers have jump stories, and I would be no different.
March 7, 1955 arrived to mark the first of five qualifying jumps which is the number required to earn your airborne wings. (And I have mine to this day.) All of our jumps were to be from a C-119 aircraft, which looks like a bee and, aerodynamically, is not supposed to be able to fly—a body that looks too big for its wings to carry. But it flew. As battery clerk, Claggett was in charge of preparing the flight manifests—and he did me the dubious favor of placing me in the number one position in four of the five qualifying jumps (number two for the fifth).
That meant I was to be the first one to exit the aircraft from the port side. I was scared dizzy when we took off and, despite the earlier and easy bravado, said to myself, “Just what in the hell am I doing here?” Sitting next to the open port door, I could see the countryside below grow smaller as we climbed to our jump altitude of 1200 feet that day. The jump location was scheduled for the Yamoto Drop Zone (the DZs were named after combat jump locations during World War II).
We flew for about ten uneasy minutes before the jumpmaster began shouting the preparatory jump commands into the intercom: “Stand up and hook up!” was the first. We were lined up in two sticks facing the port and starboard doors. You could hear the clicks of all the static lines hooking onto the eye-level cables that ran the length of the plane for each stick. “Check your equipment!” was the next. We made sure that the static line of the trooper directly in front of us was free and clear of any obstruction and then lamely looked up and down our own harnesses to make sure we were all snapped in. Then the jumpmaster called off the landmarks below: “Highway 41 comin’ up!” A heart-pounding moment later, it was, “Stand in the door!” and I automatically pivoted into the open door, hands slapped against the outside of the plane, the icy air running across my knuckles, my legs bent slightly and then involuntarily giving way to the fear that gripped me, my head staring straight ahead, my last thought being, “I can’t believe I’m doing this!” as my mind then went absolutely blank and switched to auto pilot.
Then the last terrifying command came, as I felt the jumpmaster’s hand whack my rump, “Go!” he shouted, and I went, hurtling down as if in a howling hurricane, the prop wash pitching me into its wake nearly upside down, completely disoriented but trying to keep my body all buttoned up, the roar of the motors much louder on the outside! We were trained to begin a fourcount immediately, and I did: “Hup thousand! Two Thousand! Three Thousand! Four Thousand!” And all of a sudden, it was ghostly quiet! No wind, no motors, no point of reference on a first jump. I didn’t know what to expect. We were instructed to check the parachute canopy after the four-count, so I looked up: it was fully deployed, and I whispered, “Thank you, God!” I was able then to take stock. I felt all alone, pinned to the sky, and euphoric. The 50-60 second ride down was gentle and, without a doubt, the best part of the experience. There was no wind on the DZ and it was an easy landing. Breathing hard from the excitement, I was ecstatic—as were we all!
As we folded up our chutes and headed to the assembly point, the guys exchanged comments on the wonder of it all, but not one admitted—during those moments of self-congratulation and, dare I say, swagger—that he had been scared shitless! Notwithstanding, it was in moments like those that pride gushed in who we were and what we might accomplish together. It was especially felt on our daily runs, during the cadence call, with a collective roar: Air-BORNE! We were brothers. It felt good. It was a standard of togetherness that I never—well, rarely—saw replicated later in society but wished often that we could bottle it—the loyalty, the mutual regard regardless of background, the camaraderie, the brotherhood.
One down. We waited three weeks for the next jumps, and they just did them all at once: two on March 28th and the final two the next day, on March 29th. We would never have them spaced so closely together afterward. But we were official. Shortly thereafter we proudly accepted our airborne wings. The next 11 jumps in my brief airborne career were very exciting—how could they not be? In mass jumps, collisions could occur: one trooper had to spread eagle to keep from flying into my lines; another (involuntarily) landed on top of my chute, as I yelled up to him, “Not a good idea, buddy!” and he clambered off so his chute could re-deploy; and I had a near collision myself but was able to pull hard on my lines to slip by another trooper’s chute. Prop blasts spun me upside down several times. My air was stolen once by a guy who came in under me fairly close to landing, causing my chute to collapse and me to fall the last 25–30 feet, jarring the hell out of me, but nothing was broken thanks to that physical training our commanders insisted on.
Once, on a night jump, we literally could not see anything, and the opening shock produced a riser burn on my face; but the hard part was trying to gauge where the ground was for a landing; I went into my PLF at least five times before actually hitting the ground. And several times on landing, the wind was way up and just re-inflated our chutes and dragged us some 50-75 yards before we could right ourselves. I could hear hilarious laughter and cursing all around me, one friend later saying, “They needed a traffic cop out there to direct us!” Every paratrooper has stories with variations on these themes.
But my seventh jump, on May 16, 1955, was the jump to end all jumps—and it nearly did. One of the most memorable events of my life. I was number four on the starboard stick. Claggett reserved the number one spot for himself, which was okay with me! Believe it or not, as I was picking up my pre-packed chute (paratroopers had long since stopped packing their own; a special unit did that), I had a twinge that almost said, no, not that one. But I recovered quickly and chalked it up to pre-jump jitters. I should have listened. We were to jump from 1000 feet that day. Again, the C-119 was our aircraft. The jumpmaster barked the usual commands as we approached the Los Baños (Philippines) Drop Zone. We stood, hooked up, checked equipment and shuffled forward, almost touching one another, waiting for the red light next to the open door to turn green, which was the pilot’s signal to the jumpmaster that we had arrived at the DZ.
I could see the green light flash and heard the jumpmaster’s “Go!” as the pandemonium began; the rush to the door was filled with yelling and cussing (as I had found out later when I was back in the ranks and not the first one out); everyone was eager to get out the door (for some inexplicable reason!), and I just followed along, minus the screaming. At the number four position, it was only a matter of a few seconds before my turn came. I had learned, in those terrible moments, to shut down all thinking and just charge out the door, literally throwing caution to the winds. I tumbled in the gale but kept a tight body position as I began my count—hup-thousand on down to four thousand! I looked up to check my canopy, and found to my shocking surprise that the lines were furled up, kind of like a squid, with a bit of a puff at the very top of the canopy. I was hurtling down and was in a straight up-and-down position. I looked down and saw the ground just whooshing up at me, and decided not to do that again.
I was operating on pure adrenalin, my training kicked-in to automatic, I grasped the D-Ring on my reserve chute strapped on my front, and, instinctively knowing that this was not a time to think things over, pulled hard. I had never had occasion to resort to my reserve chute before, but we were told to feed it out to the wind, and I started to do that. Parachutes can steal air from each other, and, even though the main wasn’t deployed, it was preventing my reserve’s ability to deploy. So I decided instantaneously to maximize the chances of the main to deploy over the reserve chute, and began to haul in the reserve chute. I had done everything that I knew to do and was on the verge of losing hope when, all of a sudden, the main chute popped and I was on the ground hard within another second or two in a clump of trees, off the DZ.
Someone came running up to me and breathlessly asked, “Do you know where your chute opened?” You can’t gauge heights when you’re falling, so, full of optimism over my gift of life, I guessed, saying, “I don’t know—maybe 300 feet up?” And he said, “See the top of that tree? That’s where your chute opened!” The tree was maybe 60 to 75 feet tall. I could hardly believe it! They used to tell us that if you threw a sack of potatoes the weight of an average man out of an airplane 1,000 feet up it would land in about eight seconds. Everything I’ve described happened in rapid succession, and I estimate that the time it took me to reach the ground from the moment I exited the aircraft was no more than 10 to 12 seconds.
I began a conversation with God as I walked back to the assembly point. We got to know each other a lot better from then on. I saw Bill and he said he saw someone whistling by him on the way down, assuming the worst, not knowing it was me. The commanding officer seemed to be more concerned about the reasons for the malfunctioning parachute than about my wellbeing, but finally came over and asked if I was okay. Whenever a “bad” jump happens, they try to get you back up as soon as possible to ward off the evil spirits, so the CO said something to that effect to one of the ranking noncoms in our unit to ensure that I would have another jump soon. We usually jumped every month or so, sometimes two. I was up the following week, and that one went smoothly, as these things go. I said nothing to my family about all of this until after I was discharged from the service.
As it happened, May 16 was Bill’s birthday, so we began celebrating that date as the birthday for both of us. Years later I used to observe two birthdays during the course of a year, but Dorian insisted that I had to choose just one. So I chose my re-birth of May 16. Besides, it made me 23 years younger than my original birthday, and that’s the one we observe to this day.
That parachute jump had a profound effect on my life, and on my view of life as a precious estate. It also marked the beginning of a spiritual journey for me that has deepened and enriched my life beyond measure. I could have exited my life at that time. But it was given back to me. I like to think that there was a reason, and, because of it, that maybe I should hold myself to a high standard—not a high-er standard. I believe we all should hold ourselves to a high standard, but everyone is in charge of his or her own commitment and journey to reach that higher plane.
I have chosen to take my journey quite seriously, and to use this gift of life, as my lights might allow, in service to others. The injunction to “repair the world” took on a whole new dimension for me, and I saw it not only as a fundamental Judaic teaching, but as a universal teaching that is equally reflected in all the great religions of the world. We don’t have to fight with one another over whose religion says it best. I believe we are all endowed with a spark of the Divine and that our true selves will live on beyond this “mortal coil.” But we each have a responsibility to make this life a good one for everyone, and we can do that by first recognizing that we are all part of one human family—with Divine roots.
How could this not influence my political view of the world? Interestingly, in recent years when I have tried to teach democracy to Muslims in the Middle East, I always sought to invoke the teachings of Muhammad who—wisely—enjoins his followers to respect the worth of the other person. It follows, I maintain, that such mutual respect is the beginning of problem-solving without resort to violence, and, as the circle of this practice widens, a more peaceful world is thereby given a chance to unfold. This mutual respect is often expressed as love, or kindness, or good will. They all work. And while progress has been made, I needn’t list the proofs that we still have a long way to go. For all we know, perhaps the history of this planet—whether as a place of good will or a destroyed wasteland—will be measured by the success, or lack thereof, of our aggregated individual journeys to make it a better place. As I see it, each of us thus bears some responsibility for our shared destiny, and—though it’s not for me to say—perhaps some accountability, too.
Meanwhile, as we settled back to earth, the friendship between Bill Claggett and me deepened. In August, 1955, we were transferred en masse to the storied 82nd Airborne Division at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina, where we continued our airborne training on the Drop Zones of Normandy, Salerno, and Holland. I was assigned to the Headquarters Detachment of division headquarters, instead of a line unit, where I assume the personnel folks thought my college education could be most effectively used. And there I remained until my tour ended a year later.
Claggett was assigned to another unit, but we maintained our close friendship and saw one another frequently. We mused about the prospect of international travel together after our service tours were over. We became serious about it, and began speculating about where we might go. I took it upon myself to begin writing embassies to find out about visa requirements. That brought me into contact, unbeknownst to me at the time, with the Counter-Intelligence Corps.
We were in the midst of the Cold War with the Soviet Union at the time, and there was great uncertainty about the future. Senator Joseph McCarthy began stirring up the people with incendiary accusations, without proof, about Communist affiliations. I sat in on one of McCarthy’s hearing during my Colgate semester in Washington, and he was indeed a bully. While McCarthy was condemned by the Senate on December 2, 1954, for “conduct that tended to bring the Senate into dishonor and disrepute,” the social context in the country was nevertheless one of great anxiety.
Into that milieu, I blithely and naively sent a letter to the Soviet Embassy in Washington—along with a dozen or two similar letters to other embassies—seeking information on travel to and within the Soviet Union and what visa requirements a traveler might be expected to meet. I saved everything—copies and responses—neatly clipped in a file that I kept in the bottom drawer of my desk in my office. Well, that letter of inquiry to the Soviet Embassy precipitated a wide-ranging espionage investigation into me. I didn’t find out about it until just before my discharge, when my good friend and barracks bunk neighbor, Johnny Byrd, said to me, “Jack, I think I can tell you now that your case has been closed.”

Dedication
A
S I COMPLETE this retrospective of my adventure through life, and reflect on how deeply thankful I am for the opportunity to have experienced so many of its dimensions and to have learned so much, I have carefully considered whether there was any one human being whose contribution was so primal that it made everything possible for me. There is, in fact, one such person who deeply touched my life, or, I should say, made my life possible. That person is my maternal grandfather, Abraham Goruch. He was a highly respected family leader, to be sure, though he otherwise walked humbly through his life. But one fateful day in 1911, on his inhospitable home soil of Russia, he performed an extraordinary act of personal bravery in the face of a marauding Cossack band that threatened both him and the lives of his family. As recounted in the pages that follow, he instinctively, courageously, and selflessly rose to confront that fearful and imminent danger and, at great risk to himself, succeeded in protecting them from harm. In so doing, my grandfather changed the lives of his family and its descendants forever. That included my mother, then 10 years old, and, in turn, me. It is not that his brave act changed the quality of my life; it made my life possible. So in dedicating this book to him, I proudly and gratefully honor my grandfather who, in the most profound way, gave me both the gift of life itself and the inspiration to endeavor without surcease to put it to some useful purpose.
Acknowledgments
G
RATITUDE WITH A FULL HEART is first extended to my wife, Dorian, whose love, encouragement, and forbearance during the writing of this memoir never faltered. And to my talented nephew, Dean Schramm, a Hollywood literary agent and producer, learned in the writing and publishing arts, I shall always be grateful for wise counsel and unwavering encouragement. Paul Edwards, my Kansas City campaign manager and later, an author with his wife Sarah of 17 books, was enormously helpful with suggestions, edits, and contacts. I extend special thanks, also, to my publishers at New Insights Press, especially to managing editor Rick Benzel for his many editing improvements and for leading me through the publishing maze, and to art director Susan Shankin for her brilliant cover design and book layout. I am blessed with a large group of friends, many talented writers themselves, who, with care not to hurt my feelings too much, offered thoughtful and very helpful edits to the manuscript. I list them here (alphabetically) with heartfelt gratitude: Hilary Claggett, Wynne Cougill, Cliff Johnson (my Middle East motorcycle partner), Sheldon Novick (a biographer of note), Lonnie Shalton, Judith Slaughter, and Mary Allen Wilkes. And there were so many others, beloved family as well as friends around the world, who encouraged me to write it all down. They include a unique group of Missouri legislative friends, many named in the book, who, during our tenure, took the name, ROSD—or Royal Order of Shit Disturbers, which says it all. We still meet annually. The camaraderie is delicious.
Prologue
A
WORD ABOUT HOW this book came to be: As I moved through the winter of my professional life, I began to think that I might have at least one book in me. But I wasn’t thinking about any kind of memoir at all. I liked public policy and was kind of wonky about it; in fact, as I thought about a book, I thought that maybe I could organize one around a series of essays on the great issues of the day. The topics that came to mind included climate change, Israel-Palestine, the Electoral College, immigration reform, wherefore the United Nations, unbundling Islamic teachings, and the like. Plenty of stuff out there that excites peoples’ curiosity. But that’s as far as I got. I couldn’t get the project under way because I kept saying to myself, “Who cares what I think about these issues? There are lots of scholarly treatises about them.”
Word got around to my friends and colleagues about my writing project, and, assuming it was a memoir, they peppered me with questions about it. “Will you talk about your assignments to Iraq and living in Saddam’s palace and getting bitten by rats?” Or, “Will you reveal that your first marriage was in Tangier, Morocco after a shipboard romance?” Or, “Can you work in why those Pennsylvania legislative leaders complained about you to the White House?” Or, “You won’t omit that paratroop outing when your ‘chute finally decided to open at tree-top level?” Or, “Please tell everyone about how your Missouri legislative cabal, your Royal Order of Shit Disturbers, your ROSD—how they got that name!” Or, “I loved your motorcycle adventure from Baghdad through the Middle East; it will be great to finally get the whole story.” Or, “Tell us, are we still waiting, or did China ever implement your environmental recommendations?” Or, “It will be sad but memorable to recall that election night in ’72 when we waited for the returns to come in on your lieutenant governor’s race!” And on and on it went. My friends were all very excited to read about my political episodes, consulting on four continents, and personal adventures. Their enthusiasm was marvelous, and they assumed I would definitely write about my own life. But—again—that’s not where my head was. I had my doubts. Who, besides family and friends, would be interested?
Informal remarks on my life in governance at the 50th Reunion of our Washington University Law School class
Unless, I thought one day, I could use my experiences to impart something useful to a general audience, but especially those interested in politics and perhaps having a lengthy career, as mine has been, in government. Then, as I was pondering that question, I had something of an epiphany. It was staring me right in the face. My whole life had been devoted to governance in one form or another, whether executing it as an elected and appointed official or as a consultant in so many places around the world—if I could make governance my central theme, maybe it would work. And so the plan for this book began to take shape.
I could talk about my bumpy political journey and the governance insights I gleaned from my experiences at the state, federal, and international levels—and perhaps, I speculated, others would benefit from those insights as well. My life experience, as I stopped to think about it, was very broad and the stories at each level were rich in political intrigue, power trips, and, especially as to the international work, an insider’s look into what was happening behind the headlines. I could sketch out my early years and what forces formed my thoughts about government and contributing to better the world.
Though my school friends and I considered ourselves as American as apple pie, we were all first generation Americans, and we saw this country through the eyes of our ever-grateful parents and their friends. The influences were subtle but quite real, as were others in those formative years. When I went away to college, and later, I began to see differences in my peers—in our upbringing, our values, and our points of view about the world. For example, I never heard a negative word about President Franklin Roosevelt until I was a sophomore in college! He was practically worshipped by the adults in my early life. Those early years were when my values took shape—and my naiveté and sensitivities were challenged—and they became key to the directions I took in my later professional life. I had an adventure streak a mile wide and a curiosity about the unknown, what life was about beyond my neighborhood and schools. I explored, reached out and touched things I had experienced only in books. My military experience and my worldwide travel—I didn’t want to do what, or go where, everybody else did—taught me a great deal about self-reliance, experimentation . . . and the value of seeking. It was important that I talk about those things in my book as well; they contributed to how I got to be who I am, and why I think as I do. And they became governance values every bit as much as the experiences I had in my neighborhood growing up and during my education. I like to think of it all as context.
So, finally, I had a formula for a book. I was to be a vehicle—constructed uniquely from many parts, to be sure—to provide glimpses into how government worked at many different levels. I had to explain it through the only lens I knew—me. But it wasn’t to be just about me and all of my ego—but what I learned about governance—a distinction very important to me.
Moreover, I didn’t want it to be a textbook, for heaven’s sake. The glimpses and the lessons were simply to accompany my trip through life. They were not to be served up on a silver platter, but to be ingested in a natural flow with each course of my life’s various passages. I was blown off course several times—as have we all.
For me, each new course proved to be not only useful but purposeful. I think I have been fortunate in that regard, though I do believe that it is important that we not give up on trying to make our lives count for something in the larger scheme of things. If that comes through in this book, I would be proud to be the messenger, and maybe that’s lesson enough. I hope you will bear with me as I move through some of the substantive issues I encountered in my journey. I have tried not to be too technical or legalistic about those things, but I wanted to serve up some of the flavor of the work I did, both domestically and internationally, and I trust I have found a proper balance and not been too off-putting. I hope that there is something to be learned from the experiences I have had—about governance and other things. But you be the judge.
PART 1
VALUES AND THE FORMATIVE YEARS
ONE
First Generation Life in America
M
Y WORLD BEGAN at 1:45 a.m. on Thursday, January 21, 1932 at the Missouri Baptist Hospital in St. Louis—an Aquarian, as astrology would hold, who would see the world as one closely-related human family and would paint in broad strokes. And because I landed on the cusp of Capricorn, the stars further predicted that I was to be given strength of purpose and the fortitude to move my objectives forward. Both would later prove to be my strongest inner instincts, though, I also found, they were no guarantor of success.
I was the third of four sons, and we were born in couplets. The elder pair, Marvin and Norman (in that order), were born in the 1920s with their names reflecting a more traditional world. Seven years elapsed before I came along, followed 21 months later by brother Paul, our names reflecting perhaps a tilt toward modernity. Marv and Norman, perceived by us in those early years as much older, went off to serve in the armed forces during World War II. Paul and I, closer in age, shared more of life’s experiences. We were first generation Americans. I had no idea that this was a significant demographic until decades later. We were American as apple pie, strongly patriotic—and poor. We were, after all, in the middle of the Great Depression. But that characteristic was common to everyone we knew. My mother’s maiden name was Frieda Sylvia Goruch. Born in 1901, she was second eldest of four daughters and a son, born to Abraham and Rebecca Goruch (or Goruchovsky before it was anglicized). She lived in a shtetl just outside of Kiev in what is now Ukraine, but was then under Russian rule. Jews weren’t allowed to live within the boundaries of Kiev proper. She used to tell us that the floor of their home was bare earth. Everyone had a trade in the shtetls of the time, and my maternal grandfather (born in 1875) made his living as a tailor.
Pogroms were deadly and feared by the shtetl populations of Eastern Europe during those terrible years, particularly from 1880 through 1914 when anti-Semitism raged throughout the Russian Empire. It seemed that much of the blame for all the troubles of society was laid at the feet of the already ostracized Jews, and it would only get worse unless they found a way out of there. Ukrainian Russia, where my family lived, was somehow a particular hotbed for government-sanctioned pogroms, though the Czar vehemently denied any role on his part.
One fateful day in 1911 my mother’s settlement was attacked by marauding Russian Cossacks on horseback, one swooping in to assault my grandfather, then 33, and his family. Putting his family behind him, my grandfather ran forward to intercept the rider and threw him from his horse. Since resistance was not tolerated, my grandfather had to leave his family following the altercation and flee for his life! With the parting words, “I will get you out!” he made his way to Hamburg where he hid in a lifeboat on an ocean liner bound for New Orleans. Once there, he slipped off the ship and managed to follow the Mississippi River north up to St. Louis where other immigrants he knew had settled, including (helpfully) his father, who had peacefully, to use the word loosely, emigrated there in January 1909.
There were, of course, many other European immigrant groups in that era who were escaping from very difficult circumstances, but few who feared daily for their very safety as did the Jews of the time. In the case of my grandfather, it’s accurate to say that he was one of America’s early undocumented aliens. The memory of his story is seared into my conscience and unceasingly reminds me of my own personal commitment to supporting a proper solution to a significant item of America’s unfinished business—the plight of America’s current crop of undocumented aliens. It should be easily understood that the punishing experience of the Jewish Diaspora over two millennia has forged into the DNA of successive generations of Jews, down to the present one, a sensitivity to the plight of the downtrodden and a yearning for a just society. As events will bear out in this personal account, it is certainly there in mine, as imperfect in its expression as my fettered humanity has allowed. But it is unmistakably there. What America, cloaked in an ever struggling exceptionalism, so importantly adds to the mix is a unique collection of governance values—an exciting infusion of profound democratic community—that offers a realistic hope of perfecting such a society in the fullness of time.
In the old immigrant neighborhoods of St. Louis, my grandfather, resolutely trying to find his way, found an abandoned storefront on 6th Street which, as luck would have it, contained a scrapped sign in the back that read, “Buck the Tailor.” So, with that welcoming token bestowed no doubt by his guardian angels (whose work was pretty good so far), my brave and embattled grandfather became Buck the Tailor! He saved his nickels and dimes for two years at the trade he knew, and then sent for his family who had been holding their own with the help of friends and extended family on the outskirts of Kiev.
My grandmother’s family, and her sister’s family as well, eleven strong (six Goruchovsky’s and five Kranitzky’s) arrived in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on January 13, 1913. The Canadian Pacific Railroad then ushered them down to Detroit where they were admitted into the United States, finally, feeling absolutely incredulous over what was happening in their lives. Immigration officials, as they did with so many of the European unpronounceables, shortened my grandmother’s name from Goruchovsky to Goruch and her sister’s name from Kranitzky to Crane. They then traveled overland to St. Louis—my mother was 12—where they had a joyous reunion with my grandfather who, then, impatiently escorted them to his tailor shop where they would live for a time. It had a wooden floor! Happily re-unified, the family continued its struggle for survival, but at least in freedom in this new world of theirs—no small consideration if one stops to think about it, and, as I came to believe, one that we take for granted at our peril.
Many decades later, I had a consulting assignment in Kiev. Our threesome hailed a taxi and went to visit the Babi Yar Memorial, a ravine on the outskirts of the city. It was there that the Nazis, in their war against the Soviet Union, rounded up all the Jews in the Kiev region for what they said was transportation to another holding area. Then they were told to dig further into the ravine. Over the next two days, September 29th and 30th 1941, in a ruthless operation, Nazi Sonderkommandos murdered all 33,771 Jews who were gathered there—men, women, and children. It was one of the largest single massacres in the history of the Holocaust. Other later victims at the site included thousands of Soviet POWs, communists, Gypsies, Ukrainian nationalists, and civilian hostages. Estimates are that 100,000 to 150,000 lives were taken in that ravine.
I stood there looking at it, next to the memorial, in utter disbelief, trying to conjure up the abject terror that had been experienced there and which has become a bitter lesson in the failures of humanity. I was gripped by a realization, known casually as just family history before, but shockingly thrust into my consciousness in that moment: My mother and her family would have been totally wiped out in 1941 in that ravine had my grandfather not escaped himself and sent for them 28 years earlier. Maybe my father’s family as well. We knew the stories, but standing there right in the middle of the reality of it all was overwhelming. Why do some live and some die? It reinforced my deeply felt curiosity about such bewildering issues which had plagued me for years . . . and still do.
My father, Benjamin Jacob Schramm, was born in 1899 in Volhynia Gaberna, located maybe 175 miles west of Kiev in the northwest sector of present-day Ukraine. In alternating periods of time a part of Poland, Prussia, Austria, or Russia, it belonged to the Russian Empire when my father came onto the scene.
Second eldest of four children, my father was the only boy. The anglicized names of his parents were Frank and Ida Schramm. My paternal grandfather was born about 1870 and was a Talmud teacher and scholar. Interestingly, the name Schramm is a fairly common German name. German emigration to Volhynia Gaberna, mostly from Poland but also from some German provinces, grew to a population estimated at some 200,000 by the turn of the century. So somewhere down the line, my father’s forbears took on the same name of their Christian German neighbors—probably their landowners, in much the same way, I would guess, an African American bore the name of his ancestors’ slave owners. But conditions of the Volhynian Germans began to deteriorate in the late 19th century and thousand began to emigrate to both the United States and Canada.
My paternal grandfather, like so many of his Volhynian German neighbors, took his family and emigrated to America in 1905, and made their way to St. Louis also. My father was just six. Once in St. Louis, my grandparents on both sides, still unknown to one another, settled into life—the Goruches (my grandfather finally succumbed to the practicalities of this shortened version) on Carr Street and the Schramms in a nearby neighborhood—in what is now downtown St. Louis. This is the area where most of the Eastern European immigrants gathered. Some called it a Jewish ghetto, not unlike the living habits that had been forced upon them for centuries in the shtetls of the Eastern European diaspora. It was a mutual protection and comfort thing.
My father was a good student, especially in math, and made it through the eighth grade. My mother went through the fifth grade, and left school to help out at home. A love of music, and an aptitude for its expression led my father to violin lessons. He developed a real flair for technique but his passion was especially evident as he pursed his lips and leaned forward, his body and bow arm in rhythmic synchronicity, surging from dulcet to brio on both instrument and brow, as he transited the emotional phrasing in a sweeping melody of Tchaikovsky or Beethoven. My father was in charge and ecstatic when he was doing his music—his thing. It showed on his face. It was good to see, as he didn’t have that kind of happiness—in a protracted sense—as the years wore on.
The early years were better and more promising. It was inevitable that my father would become a professional musician—and an accomplished one. Professional opportunities began to come, and he found himself organizing and leading small groups of musicians for weddings and other functions.
As he broke into his twenties, buoyed by his music and feeling lighthearted, he was emboldened to turn to matters of the heart. He met Frieda Goruch, a beautiful young girl with a pug nose and regular Slavic-like features. She agreed to accompany him on some of his playing engagements, sitting off to the side and proudly watching her boyfriend entertain all those strangers. It was kind of exciting for them both. Unable to deny their love for each other, they married in 1920—he was 21 and she 19. Thus began the tumultuous life of Ben and Frieda Schramm.
Marvin arrived in 1922 and Norman in 1924. The Roaring 20’s was a time of opportunity for musicians, perhaps the most successful time of my father’s life, as he was engaged to play dinner music at the (still) fashionable Chase Hotel. A large black sign with silver glitter letters reading “Ben Schramm and his Orchestra” hung over the stage—and he kept that sign for all the ensuing decades of his life in a closet wherever he lived.
In 1927, and feeling ready, my parents emigrated from the City of St. Louis to the County of St. Louis (two different jurisdictions). They wanted to be where the rest of the Jewish community was moving—into the adjoining suburb of University City (so named because it abutted Washington University in St. Louis and many of its streets were named for universities: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, Tulane, Colgate, Dartmouth, the more prominent ones). The family lived in three apartments over the next nine years. The stock market crashed in 1929 and the depression had engulfed everyone.
My father’s music business crashed, too. He tried to open up a dry cleaning business, but he refused to pay protection to the mob—so they threw a bomb through his window and that ended that. My mother thought she had to do something to earn some money, so she bought some hosiery and underwear at discount prices and then sold them to the employees at several hotels who agreed to the purchases if they could pay for them a little each week. So she marked up the articles and sold them at a profit. She began regular collections for these sales. And her business grew to include furniture and appliances and a retail store owner backed her with merchandise.
Her customers were all in the black community, and this kind of arrangement was the only way they could afford those necessities. She was trailblazing, one could argue, the credit card economy we have today. She didn’t know it, but she also had started the feminist movement.
As my mother was getting underway in her business, we moved to our fourth apartment in 1936. I was four. All of these apartments were located in an area called the Delmar Loop, so named because it was the streetcar turnaround for the westernmost reach of the then ‘mass transit’ system of St. Louis. Our new apartment was a third floor walkup at 6319 Delmar Boulevard, right on the main drag. The Loop was U. City’s business district and stretched for about eight blocks beyond the city line.
At the far end of the business district was Delmar-Harvard Grade School (at the corner of Delmar and Harvard Avenue), where brother Paul and I attended grade school. My political career started in kindergarten where my teachers (Miss Olmstead and Miss Iseley—I’ll never forget them) appointed me the fire chief of a red fire wagon that we had built. I remember being surprised. From humble beginnings and all that . . . .
Times were still tough for everyone in the Loop. FDR and the federal government created the Works Progress Administration (or WPA as it was popularly known) in 1935 to preserve the skills and self-respect of the working people of America. It lasted until 1943. They did everything—from infrastructure to the arts. It included the creation of the WPA symphony orchestra that played every week in University City’s Heman Park. My father signed up as a violinist, as did many of his musician friends. We frequently went to listen to the orchestra on a summer evening. My father earned about $90.00 a month, which helped with the rent, while my mother earned the grocery money.
We lived in that Delmar apartment all the way through my first year of law school. It was home. Early on, my mother’s credit business attracted other entrants—all men. About a dozen of them banded together, along with my mother (the only woman), to pool their purchasing power so that they could buy their merchandise at favorable prices. Mom held her own with the men—and her boys were proud of her, though we didn’t quite realize how extraordinary she was. The family members—all of us—just forged ahead with our lives. And enjoyed the dinners she cooked for us every evening, which we just took for granted.
My father never seemed to be able to get a toehold in business, and tried several ventures into the 1940’s. He was an artist, not a businessman, and seemed very unhappy most of the time. He was able to join several community orchestras, the first in University City and the second in Kirkwood (another suburb), and I truly think those were lifesavers for him.
One day when I was about 10, I got a look at life in the raw. My mother hired one of her customers, Margaret, to clean the house once a week to pick up the slack for her. Margaret was like one of the family. On a warm sunny day, Margaret asked if I would like a root beer—a real treat because I knew it meant going down the street to visit Blondie & Dick’s Root Beer Stand, an outdoor arrangement vividly painted in orange and black, and extremely popular in the Loop. We were seated at the bar and there were no other customers. Margaret paid for a large mug and I chugged most of it down but couldn’t finish it, so I passed it over to Margaret and asked her to finish it for me. She smiled, put the mug to her lips, and no sooner had she done that, when Blondie appeared—she startled me—and snatched the mug right out of Margaret’s hands, saying, “Sorry!”
I was only a little guy, but I was dumbstruck! I knew what had happened but could hardly believe it. Margaret was denied service by Blondie because, and only because, she was black (“African American” wasn’t in vogue yet). Margaret was hurt. I could tell it, but she held onto her dignity. I hurt, too, for Margaret, and was so very embarrassed. It just wasn’t right, I remembered thinking. We walked home in silence, but that scene remained with me throughout my life, and has informed my conscience on matters of race whenever it was in my power to do something about it. I didn’t yet know what politics was about but I believe we all face character-building moments, as this one was for me, and we either experience some kind of propulsion within us that directs us to want to make change, or we don’t. Whoever is in charge of imprinting consciences found an easy mark in me.
Little by little I began to develop a notion about how people should treat one another. I was a bit shy and serious—but proud. Not flashy or show-offy proud. But I wanted to be upstanding and didn’t want to be criticized for not doing the right thing. I then had a personal experience as a youngster that challenged my self-righteousness, if I can call it that. Every Jewish kid in my generation experienced prejudice at one time or another. Every one.
On one occasion, I was forced into a physical fight—the only one I ever had. I was only about 11. About five neighbor kids, including my brother Paul and me, went over to have some fun at an abandoned construction site nearby. We weren’t there five minutes when five older boys suddenly appeared; they were from nearby Christ the King parochial school, who were notorious for seeking out “Jew-boy Christ-killers” and beating them up. They let it be known that we were their targets. Our little group fled wildly down the hill—except me. I was too proud to run, though I don’t know what came over me. I just stood there frozen to the ground. Brother Paul was frantically calling to me to run.
The bullies selected one of their number to do the honors. Meanwhile, Paul and the other kids ran home and screamed at my brother Norman (who was 17 or 18) ‘to come rescue Jack who was getting beaten up.’ Norm rushed back with the other kids, and we were still grappling. But Norman was the equalizer and, for the sake of everyone’s pride, I guess it was, wisely asked if we wanted to fight it out, and we both nodded yes, almost automatically. To tell the truth, I wasn’t so sure. But, knowing it would now be a fair fight, and the others wouldn’t pile on, I was energized and became very aggressive, slugging the guy. After a bit, I yelled, “Tell me when you’ve had enough!” And he finally did. The bullies made a fast exit, and I remember the triumphant walk home, Norman, with his arm around my shoulder, beaming down at his little brother.
The ferocity of anti-Semitism has moderated with the passing of each generation—from the shtetls and Holocaust of my grandparents’ and parents’ time, to the present where it is certainly the case that our children have been less exposed to this mindless hatred. But it’s still out there, perhaps worse in the subtler (and sometimes not so subtle) expressions of racial bias experienced by African Americans. And today the LGBT community and Latinos are experiencing some of the same kinds of senseless hatred that stands in the way of love and acceptance of our fellow human beings. Although, over time, we assuredly have done better, we should hope that the trajectory improves.
So, if one is born into a cauldron of “them” and “us,” attitudes are shaped. Certainly mine were shaped—as one of “them”—by personally witnessing and experiencing, even at a tender age, the callousness of hatred, the damage it inflicts, and the sorrow it leaves behind. I cannot square it with any concept of cosmic morality that I have encountered. Others may be born into, and come to identify with a culture of “us vs. them.” It must be very difficult to wrest one’s mind from this kind of negativity and the divisiveness that those influences tend to weave into one’s DNA. The struggle between these two forces has been played out in America since our beginnings as we try to “form a more perfect union.” I happen to believe that the expansion of personal liberties will continue, but those of like mind will need to persevere to make it happen.
Nowadays the “other side,” to put it gently, is more sophisticated in its discrimination. It couches its lack of concern for “them” in the polemics of such phantoms as fear of takeover (reflected in restrictive immigration policy and absence of gun control), fear of abuse (reflected in hobbled voting rights ), Biblical injunction (reflected in restraints on LGBT rights, women’s rights), big government intrusiveness (reflected in seeking an unshackling from economic, environmental, and all manner of regulation), and constitutional exhortation (using the Constitution to restrict rather than enlarge rights—such as using the 10th Amendment ‘powers reserved to the states’ clause to de-fang Federal jurisdiction or the 14th Amendment ‘due process’ clause to undo abortion rights).
TWO
Political Nascence: The Fledgling Years
S
EVERAL YEARS AGO when I joined my classmates in St. Louis for the 50th reunion of our graduation from the Washington University School of Law, we were asked to explain the circumstances surrounding our decision to study law and what our legal careers were all about. When my turn came, I said I had wanted to become a lawyer since the age of 12, but that my principal motivation was not so much to practice but rather to make law. I didn’t know where that came from, I joked, unless I had been in the Roman Senate in a previous life. The way politics gripped my life throughout my school years, and ineluctably directed me toward politics later, has made me wonder where in the world that inner drive and motivation truly came from.
Even in my neighborhood growing up, and still in grade school, I seemed to have had a penchant for organizing things. It wasn’t anything special, and I didn’t attach any significance to it. I suggested stuff and the kids just followed along. For example, I organized a “Bike Patrol,” looking for I don’t know what, evil-doers, I suppose. Also an “army” of 12 young stalwarts—and I was the general, of course. This was during World War II and we even did hikes as training maneuvers and “played guns.” The NRA would have been proud! Probably the most fun was the cork ball league I organized where St. Louis kids (it’s the only place it’s played) learned to hit lightning fast balls and curves, thrown with a tennis ball, with a sawed-off broomstick. And that morphed into a fast pitch baseball team that I organized to play against other neighborhood teams, all before we were in high school. We used to create our own amusements as there were no professional youth organizers or clubs in the 1940s.
My 7th to 9th grade happened at Ward Junior High School. As we reached the end of the 8th grade and the election of next year’s student council president loomed, I found myself a candidate, at the behest of some friends. It was 1945 and the world was consumed by the prospect of World War II coming to an end. The surrender of Germany and Japan (the latter prompted by the use of atomic weapons) was only a few months off. So in my speech to the student body, I spoke of the scourge of war and how we had to be steadfast in the face of its challenges. Never mind what I would do for the school, if elected. I was only 13, had just been bar mitzvahed a few months earlier and obviously had taken the Hebrew injunction of Tikun Olam (Repair the World) perhaps too seriously, for this election anyway. But so it would be for the rest of my life. Well, I won the election (my first), and I was teasingly reminded of that speech by classmates as many as 30 years later! In this, I learned that if you can’t do relevance, memorable is good!
The next phase of my busy life took place at University City Senior High School. From ages 15 through 17, everything was new and wonderful, and included sports, fraternities, dating, and school politics, too. Sports, especially, consumed me. I was good at baseball and lettered in all three of my high school years. I also played American Legion baseball and in summer industrial leagues—with and against players who went to the major leagues.
Then there were clubs, the school newspaper, and, of course, the student council. My home room class elected me to the student council in the 10th grade. I worked hard in my studies and became a self-starter as I knew help from home was unlikely. Academically, I was above average and finally made the honor roll in my last couple of semesters. Grades were truly earned in those days the hard way.
The end of the 11th grade came and, with it, campaign time for the office of student body president for our senior year. Or, to be more precise, for the first half of our senior year; the school administration thought it best to share this school honor between two students, one for each semester. Again, friends urged me to run. I would never have run without their encouragement, as my shy self would have thought it too presumptuous to run otherwise. Election day came and we gave our speeches. I don’t remember what I said, but I won (or maybe my campaign manager, Chuck Walker, won; he gave a very entertaining speech). So, on this one, I learned that if you can’t do substance, entertainment is good!
Senior year came, and it was an exciting one. Presiding over the student council and its work, chair of the Junior-Senior Prom Committee, I was also selected (I don’t remember how) to be Mayor of University City for a Day. I continued to take everything seriously. One day, Miss Briscoe, our student council faculty sponsor, gently nudged me not to overdo it by saying, “Jack, I heard one girl say that she would love it if you would just smile!” Notwithstanding, in the final tallies for senior class ‘most this and that,’ Dick Dutton, student body president in the second semester, and I tied as “Most Popular Boy.” So maybe it was okay to be serious-minded!
Of course, during senior year, the thoughts of almost all of my classmates turned to college—where would we go? U. City High School had developed a sterling reputation in the university community as among the best high schools in St. Louis County—and there were dozens. About 90% of its graduates went on to college. Everyone was expected to. Most of us were first generation Americans and “People of the Book,” and we knew that education was a path to the American dream. It was 1949. The Great Depression and World War II both had ended, and I instinctively felt that education would help me accomplish things that were beginning to stir deeply within me. For those of us living in the Delmar Loop especially, we couldn’t wait to get started.
Since Princeton and Harvard took our academic stars, it was hard for me not to dream, too, about going to an Eastern college. My family certainly could not afford it. So while I was awaiting some celestial guidance, the admissions dean from Colgate University in Hamilton, New York decided to visit our high school for the first time, based on our reputation. I attended—and was hooked by pictures of the beautiful campus in a small town, an all-male student body of only 1,300, the core curriculum of philosophy and religion, public affairs, the study of an alternative culture, but mostly by the prospect of joining the Washington Study Group for a semester of studying the federal government right there in its offices. Though it was late in the season, I sent for an application and, shortly thereafter, was contacted by Tom DePew, Colgate’s college advisor for St. Louis. We hit it off famously. A successful businessman, Tom always wanted to help deserving people, often saying to me throughout the course of a lifelong friendship, “We’ve got to help them, Jack!” I didn’t realize at the time that I was one of his early projects. He proved to be one of the most decent people I have ever known.
I needed a scholarship and Tom went to bat for me to be sure I received one. What I didn’t know until well after I had graduated was that I had applied too late for financial aid for my freshman year, and that Tom had arranged with the school to pay for my freshman year himself. He really wanted me to go to Colgate! (I have since established a scholarship at Colgate as a way of repaying Tom’s poignant and indelible kindness.) My record after my first year persuaded Colgate, going forward, to cover my annual tuition and provide work in the library and dining facilities to defray room and board. This amounted to two-thirds of the cost of attending, or $1,600.00 per year. My parents footed the remaining third, or $800.00. How things have changed, as fellow parents will attest!
My freshman year at Colgate was exciting. I made lots of friends, pledged Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, one of the more popular ones, and in contravention of its ‘only for Christians’ clause. Again, I was asked to run for freshman class president by friends. As I recall, my speech was about how all of us should receive invitations to the fraternities, as Princeton had done for its eating clubs, because those who were left out (about 15% of the class) truly missed an important social dimension offered by the college. The idea was that if one was good enough to be admitted to the college, he was good enough to be admitted to a fraternity. I won the election. It was then that I knew I would be elected Student Senate president for my senior year. And that’s what happened. It was a strange feeling because it was almost as if I could will my success in these elections. My arrogance would get its comeuppance as time went on, but I was feeling my oats at the time.
My life at Colgate was truly fulfilling. After the freshman class presidency, my fraternity thought I should represent it in the Student Senate, which served only to whet my appetite for more. “Politics” is the word commonly used to describe this kind of activity, but I didn’t use the term. I thought it was much more like a responsibility that one should exercise on behalf of one’s fellows. I was still possessed of that serious and very idealistic turn of mind. After my sophomore year, I won a scholarship from the Experiment in International Living to spend the summer in Morelia, Mexico living with a Mexican family, where I soaked up the culture and language, and broadened my vistas. With courses in International Law and International Organization, I was really getting turned on to the international scene.
During my junior year, my international affairs professor, Dr. Robert Elder, had me appointed to two inter-collegiate positions that would further excite my interest in international policy. The first was as president of the Upstate New York Model United Nations Security Council, comprised of eleven regional universities, which I found intriguing. The second appointment, somewhat more challenging, was as a Main Committee chair at meetings of the Mid-Atlantic Model United Nations General Assembly being held, of all places, at the United Nations Building in New York City. Well, let me tell you—how could a young person not be impressed by conducting even faux UN business in the ECOSOC Chamber itself!
Apparently I was not so bad at doing presiding officer stuff because, at the close of our three day meetings, and in the session where the participants (representing some 60 colleges and universities from the Mid-Atlantic states) were to select the presiding officers for the following year’s session, I was elected to serve as president of the General Assembly. Again, I thought to myself, what is going on here?
Back at Colgate, at the end of my junior year, I was elected student body president and presided over the Student Senate for the first semester of my senior year, but had to turn the gavel over to the vice president (Vail Taylor, a wonderful and deservedly well-respected guy) in the second semester so I could spend that semester in Washington, D.C. with the Washington Study Group. But I had an insight during a philosophy course with Dr. Holmes Hartshorne during that first semester that has remained with me throughout my political life. Dr. Hartshorne explained the American political experience as a national commitment to the autonomous individual. “Well, what does that mean,” he probed?
“Autonomous,” he explained, “derives from two Greek words: ‘autos’ meaning self and ‘nomos’ meaning reason or order. Thus, the self-reasoning or self-ordered individual.”
Then Dr. Hartshorne went on to apply this fundamental concept to our political parties. “The Republicans,” he explained, “emphasize the ‘autos’ or self and are identified with free private enterprise, the values of liberty, and untrammeled, to the extent possible, individual expression. And, for their part, Democrats emphasize the ‘nomos’ and thus are more identified with the reasonable use of government to achieve order and social welfare, emphasizing the equality of individuals in the process. But each carries the seeds and values of the other so that they both can lay claim to a commitment to the autonomous individual. Thus, while Republicans want to reduce regulation and allow Wall Street and the banks to exercise their financial and business creativity for the benefit of all, they would be hesitant to overturn the ‘nomos’ dimension of the equation as represented by Social Security or perhaps other social measures.”
“And the Democrats,” Dr. Hartshorne continued, “although fully committed to the beneficial uses of government as reflected in the ‘nomos’ dimension of this equation, are at the same time committed to the private enterprise system, liberty, and private expression as reflected in the ‘autos,’ perhaps not as ardently as the Republicans, but it is a strongly shared value nonetheless.”
That little insight, as explained by Dr. Hartshorne, was an epiphany for me, and I have carried those words with me throughout my life. They are a great summary of American political life. To me, they mean that we are a nation of shared values. There is more that unites us than divides us. Our differences are a matter of degree. The American political process of transparency and openly debating our differences is designed to allow us to glimpse what the other guy is thinking, to understand it even if we don’t agree with it, and to work to resolve our differences in a peaceful way. The “autonomous individual”—this way of thinking about who we are—is a notion that encapsulates our common worth and has always brought us together in times of national stress. It has kept me sane.
My final semester in Washington, D.C. was a memorable experience! We were ten students, both seniors and juniors, and, as it happened, split down the middle politically—five Republicans and five Democrats. By this time, I knew that my heart was firmly planted on the Democratic side of the aisle. I was able to sharpen my debating skills as we argued all the time, even on the trolley every morning as we headed up to the Capitol from the YMCA where we stayed. That was my first taste of anyone daring to articulate to my face a difference with the way I saw the world! I was comfortable with my views and initially wondered how in the world they—my classmates—could come to such different conclusions. Didn’t we have the same facts and concerns? Well, needless to say, I got quite an education in public policy from my Republican friends. A shot across my naïve bow! What a politically sheltered life I had led!
It was 1953 and Dwight Eisenhower was president, having defeated Adlai Stevenson—such a refined, intelligent fellow, I remember musing—the year before. The semester was eye-opening at so many levels—from a visit in the White House to interview Ike’s press secretary; to a personal interview with Vice President Richard Nixon; to a period of study in the State Department (as a group) and then the Department of Labor (we each had to choose an agency); and, finally, in connection with our study of Congress, its members, and the legislative process, to some three weeks or so as an intern in our own congressman’s office—mine was Representative Tom Curtis, a Republican representing the greater part of St. Louis County. I remember thinking to myself that, someday, I would run for that selfsame seat—and I did some 23 years later, in 1976. Clearly, by this time, I had an undeniable feeling that politics was to be my calling.
Midway through the semester, Dr. Elder and I took a long weekend off to head to Ithaca, N.Y, where I was to assume my responsibilities as President of the Mid-Atlantic Model UN General Assembly. It was to convene at the Cornell Law School. I worked closely, and also shared a dormitory room, with Peter Kenen, a Columbia University student who had been selected to be the Secretary-General. I addressed him as “Peter” and he addressed me as “Your Excellency.” Peter was brilliant and played his role to the hilt. He later received his doctorate at Harvard and, from 1971 through 2004, was the Walker Professor of Economics and International Finance at Princeton and became internationally renowned.
By that time, I had presided over so many student groups that I remember having felt fairly confident and comfortable in managing the flow of debate and occasionally interceding to push along the resolution of an issue. It was a confidence-builder for me and a very satisfying learning experience. When we were packing up to go home following a crowded few days of international problem-solving with wonderfully creative peers—we all wished that we could have had a real go at these issues—Dr. Elder, with whom I had developed a warm relationship, privately whispered to me, “Jack, when you get into this work for real, don’t forget to contact me for consulting purposes!” Given the knowledge imbalance between my professor and me, that he would suggest that I hire him some day—did I really hear what I heard? Though stunned, I was secretly very pleased with what I was doing to warrant Dr. Elder’s confidence.
Dr. Elder and I returned to the program in Washington, concluded our semester’s work in May, and returned to campus to prepare for graduation for those of us who were seniors. I finished my academics with a deep major in political science and two minors—one in philosophy and one in Spanish, both of which I truly relished. I sat with the political science faculty for the departmental honors exam, a daunting exercise! My GPA put me in the top 10% of my class which qualified me for the honors exam with cum laude standing. It could have been magna but for a few C’s in my first couple of semesters while I was learning how to study at the college level. A leak that a faculty friend coaxed out of several political science faculty colleagues revealed to our collective glee that my oral exam was of high honors caliber. But I was delighted, after all was said and done, to graduate Cum Laude with Honors in Political Science from a place like Colgate; I also felt honored to have been admitted to both the junior and senior honorary societies and to have been awarded a George W. Cobb Fellowship for leadership. More than delighted for a boy from the Delmar Loop.
THREE
The Influences of Law School and Military Service
I
WAS ADMITTED TO the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis where I began my first year of legal studies in the Fall of 1953. I lived at home in the Loop, could walk to classes, and had a scholarship loan from the St. Louis Scholarship Foundation. It was good not to be a further financial burden to my parents, who were busy helping my brother Paul through undergraduate school, and later law school, at the University of Missouri-Columbia, some 120 miles away. To have the credential—a law degree—was an enthralling prospect for me.
What a budding lawyer learns from the very beginning is the necessity of finding the core issue of a problem at the very outset of a dispute, how to express it and be right about it. It is necessary in this kind of analysis to put aside any coloration of the issue, whether based in emotion or philosophy, and see it as it is—the reality of the matter in the bright light of day. Being clear-eyed about a problem’s core issues and dimensions is the sine qua non to its satisfactory resolution. Resorting to morality and philosophy are fine when addressing the resolution question, but it is imperative to be realistic about the fundamental problem you are faced with.
I have always felt that the study of the law was an excellent preparation for a career in politics or in the development or execution of public policy. To be sure, one can learn to be an effective public practitioner through other professional disciplines, but, at least in my opinion, the best preparation for a socio-legal gap analysis and the application of an apt legislative solution is legal training. I hasten to add, however, that I think it would be a mistake to have a legislative body solely comprised of lawyers. A policy-making body benefits from a wide range of life experiences. For me and my inclinations though, I was satisfied that legal training would best equip me for public policy analysis and leadership.
We learned all about research methods and how to use the library in that first year. We didn’t have computers then and no access to lightning fast answers to majority and minority rules in any given jurisdiction. Instead we plowed through the books, took copious notes on what we found, painstakingly “shepardized” our cases, as we called it, to ensure that their holdings had not been later overruled or amended, and then laboriously hunt-and-pecked on our old typewriters to complete our research papers.
Well into my second semester, I started to think hard about the final two years of law school, and especially about the prospect of piling up further debt through the scholarship loan, which was still available to me. The GI Bill was another option open to me but only for a few more months since the Korean War was in the process of officially winding down in 1954. I decided to go for it. I kept my own counsel in this process, as I did for most things—master of my own fate kind of thing. This was characteristic of all of my collegiate decision-making, and truly felt throughout my life that I was the one, the only one, really in charge of my destiny. Not to be too dramatic about it, but I felt that I was the one to take my fate—my own fate—into my own hands, that no one could do for me what I was supposed to do for myself.
Truth be told, I had something of an adventurous streak within me. It was related to my natural curiosity and extended to unknown things, places, and experiences, sort of a fascination with things beyond my ken. This curiosity about the unknown later led me to spiritual places that helped me come to terms with my place in the world, and to accept both my disappointments and successes with equanimity—a sense of balance and calm.
In that broader connection, I always both admired and envied my genius nephew, David Schramm (a 6’4” red-headed giant of a man and eldest son of brother Marvin), who was short-listed for a Nobel in astrophysics before his untimely accidental death in 1997 at the age of 52, flying his own plane (having picked up the love of flying airplanes from his father). A physical as well as an intellectual adventurer, Dave climbed mountains on every continent, except Antarctica, despite having several near-death experiences. He learned the rough and tumble side of life as an all-state wrestler as a Missouri high school senior and as a New England heavyweight wrestling champion when he was at MIT. Nearly made the Olympic team, too.
In his other life, David, former chairman of the Department of Astrophysics at the University of Chicago and manager of the Fermilab there, and ever the adventurer, aggressively plumbed the depths of the cosmos, and its Black Holes. In that pursuit, he did much to unite cosmic mysteries with those of particle physics, and found, in this unity, a greater understanding of the Big Bang of creation and the now accepted concept of an ever-expanding universe that followed.
A New York Times remembrance essay by Dennis Overbye following Dave’s death reported that the science community was stunned “that a man described as a force of nature could be gone.” Added British theoretical physicist Stephen W. Hawking, for whom Dave served as best man at his wedding, “. . . David was larger than life in so many ways.” David was looking for ultimate answers—the biggest “why” of all. I am sure that in the quiet confines of his lab, he had an “aha” moment or two, and I would so much like to have seen what Dave saw. I have often wondered if, as the poet John Magee said, he had “touched the face of God.” Doubtless, he has the answers now—and so will we all, some day.
I don’t know if there is an “adventure” gene in some members of the Schramm clan or not (although, in retrospect, as I look at my brothers and some of their offspring, and my own, I might perhaps be persuaded!). Be that as it may, as I stood there in 1954 facing whatever the future held for me, I didn’t know, nor could I, what astonishing dimensions my life would assume in the next few years.
My peers and I had registered for the draft each year beginning at age 18, and those of us in college, like me, had received deferments. So, having decided to take the plunge, I volunteered for the draft, as the procedure was called, and found myself being sworn into the army as a recruit on August 30, 1954. I was 22.
Off they sent me to Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, where I endured eight weeks of basic training, followed by another eight weeks of field artillery training. There, I learned to fire and clean all manner of firearms. Those drill sergeants were a breed apart, but I learned an unforgettable life lesson from their often raging, if not bullying, insistence on just about everything—that “there are no excuses; just get the job done, dammit!” The phrase clearly suits the military mission, but is not bad for the rest of us, too. Like most young people, I had often found a reason to put something off. Thereafter, however, I heard the demands of my drill sergeants ringing in my ears, making me feel compulsive at times.
And, when Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, published her book Lean In in 2012 urging that women take charge of their own lives and, as part of her charge, advising them (and everyone else, for that matter) to “relentlessly prioritize,” I felt an instant resonating connection between her call for urgency in the workplace and that demanded by my drill sergeants, both urging execution and achievement in the face of difficult tasks to be accomplished. Good lessons find ways to reinforce themselves.
Thus, I reconciled the seeming competition between my astrological predilections: Capricorn’s impulse to get the lead out is given direction by my Aquarian why-and-wherefore inquiries to get the humanitarian policy focus right. I’ve always been comfortable with that personality setting.
We were all then to be shipped off for further training, but we had some say-so in the matter. One of the options was to go airborne—strictly for volunteers. I thought that if I had to go into combat, I wanted to be with folks who were better trained for it and good warriors. And then, the adventure streak kicked in, and the thought that followed was that this could really be interesting and challenging and maybe even fun. So, without pondering it further, I volunteered, and was promptly shipped off to the 11th Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, not quite knowing what to expect. The paratroopers there made an immediate impression on me. For one thing, they seemed bigger; for another, their fatigues were starched, pressed, and spotless, and their bloused boots were polished like a mirror. These guys were proud. I liked that.
After processing, I was assigned to the 675 Airborne Field Artillery Battalion, and my company commander was 1st Lt. “Tiger” Jones who virtually growled his orders. His top sergeant was Sgt. DeLaskey whose face looked like my boxer, but who had a gentler side, I later discovered, which he kept well hidden. This was to be my home unit at Fort Campbell, but the first order of business was our airborne training. Actually, the first order of business was PT—physical training. It preceded everything an airborne unit did. We ran for miles at a time, often to a rhythmic cadence sounded off by our trainers. We did hundreds of pushups in a day, usually 20 at a time, interspersed with other forms of calisthenics. We did palms-out pullups, which I had never been able to do before. If a guy was out of sync in an exercise count, he was immediately identified and an order crisply issued, “Drop for 20, soldier!”
What I truly admired and will never forget is the time when the drill sergeant, who was up on a platform and doing all of the calisthenics with us, screwed up his own count, and volunteered, “My mistake! At ease! I will drop for 20,” at which point he dropped to do 20 pushups while the rest of us stood in formation, feet spread, hands clasped behind our backs, watching in stony silence—and with utter respect. If one ever had cause to wonder how these elite units develop such camaraderie and self-sacrifice in their ranks, this is one small illustration. With this physical routine every day, I never harbored any doubt that this was the best physical shape I had ever been in either before or since that time.
Doubtless, the most gratifying consequence of my assignment to this unit was meeting Bill Claggett. Bill had been in the service three or four months longer than I, had been earlier discovered by Sgt. DeLaskey and worked for him as the battery clerk. Bill, from Dayton, Ohio, had two Harvard degrees in city planning and was later to have a great career as a government advisor, professor, and consultant. Bill and I grew close as brothers and became lifelong friends.
Our airborne training proceeded apace. We practiced Parachute Landing Falls—PLFs as we called them—jumping hundreds of times from four foot platforms, learning how to distribute our weight as we hit the ground. Then they had a contraption about three stories high, sort of like a fire tower, where you strapped yourself into a parachute harness with lines attached to a cable above, waited for a jump command, and then threw yourself out of the door trying to keep a tight body position as you were sharply caught by the cable above and your legs fought the restraining harness that wanted to wrench them outward, all the while being zip-wired down to an end-point about fifty yards off.
The idea was to teach us, upon exiting an airplane, to maintain a tight body position—head down, arms clutching your reserve chute below your chest with your right palm over the D-ring, and legs bent slightly but absolutely together—no matter what air pressures were attempting to drive your members apart. If you couldn’t keep your legs together when jumping the tower—and it hurt to do so—then you had to do the tower way more than you wanted to.
After weeks of PT and jump school practice, we finally reached show time—an actual jump. I kept a Jump Log for all sixteen jumps that I made in the service, which identified the date, the drop zone, my stick position, the type of jump, and remarks about any unique features of the jump. All troopers have jump stories, and I would be no different.
March 7, 1955 arrived to mark the first of five qualifying jumps which is the number required to earn your airborne wings. (And I have mine to this day.) All of our jumps were to be from a C-119 aircraft, which looks like a bee and, aerodynamically, is not supposed to be able to fly—a body that looks too big for its wings to carry. But it flew. As battery clerk, Claggett was in charge of preparing the flight manifests—and he did me the dubious favor of placing me in the number one position in four of the five qualifying jumps (number two for the fifth).
That meant I was to be the first one to exit the aircraft from the port side. I was scared dizzy when we took off and, despite the earlier and easy bravado, said to myself, “Just what in the hell am I doing here?” Sitting next to the open port door, I could see the countryside below grow smaller as we climbed to our jump altitude of 1200 feet that day. The jump location was scheduled for the Yamoto Drop Zone (the DZs were named after combat jump locations during World War II).
We flew for about ten uneasy minutes before the jumpmaster began shouting the preparatory jump commands into the intercom: “Stand up and hook up!” was the first. We were lined up in two sticks facing the port and starboard doors. You could hear the clicks of all the static lines hooking onto the eye-level cables that ran the length of the plane for each stick. “Check your equipment!” was the next. We made sure that the static line of the trooper directly in front of us was free and clear of any obstruction and then lamely looked up and down our own harnesses to make sure we were all snapped in. Then the jumpmaster called off the landmarks below: “Highway 41 comin’ up!” A heart-pounding moment later, it was, “Stand in the door!” and I automatically pivoted into the open door, hands slapped against the outside of the plane, the icy air running across my knuckles, my legs bent slightly and then involuntarily giving way to the fear that gripped me, my head staring straight ahead, my last thought being, “I can’t believe I’m doing this!” as my mind then went absolutely blank and switched to auto pilot.
Then the last terrifying command came, as I felt the jumpmaster’s hand whack my rump, “Go!” he shouted, and I went, hurtling down as if in a howling hurricane, the prop wash pitching me into its wake nearly upside down, completely disoriented but trying to keep my body all buttoned up, the roar of the motors much louder on the outside! We were trained to begin a fourcount immediately, and I did: “Hup thousand! Two Thousand! Three Thousand! Four Thousand!” And all of a sudden, it was ghostly quiet! No wind, no motors, no point of reference on a first jump. I didn’t know what to expect. We were instructed to check the parachute canopy after the four-count, so I looked up: it was fully deployed, and I whispered, “Thank you, God!” I was able then to take stock. I felt all alone, pinned to the sky, and euphoric. The 50-60 second ride down was gentle and, without a doubt, the best part of the experience. There was no wind on the DZ and it was an easy landing. Breathing hard from the excitement, I was ecstatic—as were we all!
As we folded up our chutes and headed to the assembly point, the guys exchanged comments on the wonder of it all, but not one admitted—during those moments of self-congratulation and, dare I say, swagger—that he had been scared shitless! Notwithstanding, it was in moments like those that pride gushed in who we were and what we might accomplish together. It was especially felt on our daily runs, during the cadence call, with a collective roar: Air-BORNE! We were brothers. It felt good. It was a standard of togetherness that I never—well, rarely—saw replicated later in society but wished often that we could bottle it—the loyalty, the mutual regard regardless of background, the camaraderie, the brotherhood.
One down. We waited three weeks for the next jumps, and they just did them all at once: two on March 28th and the final two the next day, on March 29th. We would never have them spaced so closely together afterward. But we were official. Shortly thereafter we proudly accepted our airborne wings. The next 11 jumps in my brief airborne career were very exciting—how could they not be? In mass jumps, collisions could occur: one trooper had to spread eagle to keep from flying into my lines; another (involuntarily) landed on top of my chute, as I yelled up to him, “Not a good idea, buddy!” and he clambered off so his chute could re-deploy; and I had a near collision myself but was able to pull hard on my lines to slip by another trooper’s chute. Prop blasts spun me upside down several times. My air was stolen once by a guy who came in under me fairly close to landing, causing my chute to collapse and me to fall the last 25–30 feet, jarring the hell out of me, but nothing was broken thanks to that physical training our commanders insisted on.
Once, on a night jump, we literally could not see anything, and the opening shock produced a riser burn on my face; but the hard part was trying to gauge where the ground was for a landing; I went into my PLF at least five times before actually hitting the ground. And several times on landing, the wind was way up and just re-inflated our chutes and dragged us some 50-75 yards before we could right ourselves. I could hear hilarious laughter and cursing all around me, one friend later saying, “They needed a traffic cop out there to direct us!” Every paratrooper has stories with variations on these themes.
But my seventh jump, on May 16, 1955, was the jump to end all jumps—and it nearly did. One of the most memorable events of my life. I was number four on the starboard stick. Claggett reserved the number one spot for himself, which was okay with me! Believe it or not, as I was picking up my pre-packed chute (paratroopers had long since stopped packing their own; a special unit did that), I had a twinge that almost said, no, not that one. But I recovered quickly and chalked it up to pre-jump jitters. I should have listened. We were to jump from 1000 feet that day. Again, the C-119 was our aircraft. The jumpmaster barked the usual commands as we approached the Los Baños (Philippines) Drop Zone. We stood, hooked up, checked equipment and shuffled forward, almost touching one another, waiting for the red light next to the open door to turn green, which was the pilot’s signal to the jumpmaster that we had arrived at the DZ.
I could see the green light flash and heard the jumpmaster’s “Go!” as the pandemonium began; the rush to the door was filled with yelling and cussing (as I had found out later when I was back in the ranks and not the first one out); everyone was eager to get out the door (for some inexplicable reason!), and I just followed along, minus the screaming. At the number four position, it was only a matter of a few seconds before my turn came. I had learned, in those terrible moments, to shut down all thinking and just charge out the door, literally throwing caution to the winds. I tumbled in the gale but kept a tight body position as I began my count—hup-thousand on down to four thousand! I looked up to check my canopy, and found to my shocking surprise that the lines were furled up, kind of like a squid, with a bit of a puff at the very top of the canopy. I was hurtling down and was in a straight up-and-down position. I looked down and saw the ground just whooshing up at me, and decided not to do that again.
I was operating on pure adrenalin, my training kicked-in to automatic, I grasped the D-Ring on my reserve chute strapped on my front, and, instinctively knowing that this was not a time to think things over, pulled hard. I had never had occasion to resort to my reserve chute before, but we were told to feed it out to the wind, and I started to do that. Parachutes can steal air from each other, and, even though the main wasn’t deployed, it was preventing my reserve’s ability to deploy. So I decided instantaneously to maximize the chances of the main to deploy over the reserve chute, and began to haul in the reserve chute. I had done everything that I knew to do and was on the verge of losing hope when, all of a sudden, the main chute popped and I was on the ground hard within another second or two in a clump of trees, off the DZ.
Someone came running up to me and breathlessly asked, “Do you know where your chute opened?” You can’t gauge heights when you’re falling, so, full of optimism over my gift of life, I guessed, saying, “I don’t know—maybe 300 feet up?” And he said, “See the top of that tree? That’s where your chute opened!” The tree was maybe 60 to 75 feet tall. I could hardly believe it! They used to tell us that if you threw a sack of potatoes the weight of an average man out of an airplane 1,000 feet up it would land in about eight seconds. Everything I’ve described happened in rapid succession, and I estimate that the time it took me to reach the ground from the moment I exited the aircraft was no more than 10 to 12 seconds.
I began a conversation with God as I walked back to the assembly point. We got to know each other a lot better from then on. I saw Bill and he said he saw someone whistling by him on the way down, assuming the worst, not knowing it was me. The commanding officer seemed to be more concerned about the reasons for the malfunctioning parachute than about my wellbeing, but finally came over and asked if I was okay. Whenever a “bad” jump happens, they try to get you back up as soon as possible to ward off the evil spirits, so the CO said something to that effect to one of the ranking noncoms in our unit to ensure that I would have another jump soon. We usually jumped every month or so, sometimes two. I was up the following week, and that one went smoothly, as these things go. I said nothing to my family about all of this until after I was discharged from the service.
As it happened, May 16 was Bill’s birthday, so we began celebrating that date as the birthday for both of us. Years later I used to observe two birthdays during the course of a year, but Dorian insisted that I had to choose just one. So I chose my re-birth of May 16. Besides, it made me 23 years younger than my original birthday, and that’s the one we observe to this day.
That parachute jump had a profound effect on my life, and on my view of life as a precious estate. It also marked the beginning of a spiritual journey for me that has deepened and enriched my life beyond measure. I could have exited my life at that time. But it was given back to me. I like to think that there was a reason, and, because of it, that maybe I should hold myself to a high standard—not a high-er standard. I believe we all should hold ourselves to a high standard, but everyone is in charge of his or her own commitment and journey to reach that higher plane.
I have chosen to take my journey quite seriously, and to use this gift of life, as my lights might allow, in service to others. The injunction to “repair the world” took on a whole new dimension for me, and I saw it not only as a fundamental Judaic teaching, but as a universal teaching that is equally reflected in all the great religions of the world. We don’t have to fight with one another over whose religion says it best. I believe we are all endowed with a spark of the Divine and that our true selves will live on beyond this “mortal coil.” But we each have a responsibility to make this life a good one for everyone, and we can do that by first recognizing that we are all part of one human family—with Divine roots.
How could this not influence my political view of the world? Interestingly, in recent years when I have tried to teach democracy to Muslims in the Middle East, I always sought to invoke the teachings of Muhammad who—wisely—enjoins his followers to respect the worth of the other person. It follows, I maintain, that such mutual respect is the beginning of problem-solving without resort to violence, and, as the circle of this practice widens, a more peaceful world is thereby given a chance to unfold. This mutual respect is often expressed as love, or kindness, or good will. They all work. And while progress has been made, I needn’t list the proofs that we still have a long way to go. For all we know, perhaps the history of this planet—whether as a place of good will or a destroyed wasteland—will be measured by the success, or lack thereof, of our aggregated individual journeys to make it a better place. As I see it, each of us thus bears some responsibility for our shared destiny, and—though it’s not for me to say—perhaps some accountability, too.
Meanwhile, as we settled back to earth, the friendship between Bill Claggett and me deepened. In August, 1955, we were transferred en masse to the storied 82nd Airborne Division at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina, where we continued our airborne training on the Drop Zones of Normandy, Salerno, and Holland. I was assigned to the Headquarters Detachment of division headquarters, instead of a line unit, where I assume the personnel folks thought my college education could be most effectively used. And there I remained until my tour ended a year later.
Claggett was assigned to another unit, but we maintained our close friendship and saw one another frequently. We mused about the prospect of international travel together after our service tours were over. We became serious about it, and began speculating about where we might go. I took it upon myself to begin writing embassies to find out about visa requirements. That brought me into contact, unbeknownst to me at the time, with the Counter-Intelligence Corps.
We were in the midst of the Cold War with the Soviet Union at the time, and there was great uncertainty about the future. Senator Joseph McCarthy began stirring up the people with incendiary accusations, without proof, about Communist affiliations. I sat in on one of McCarthy’s hearing during my Colgate semester in Washington, and he was indeed a bully. While McCarthy was condemned by the Senate on December 2, 1954, for “conduct that tended to bring the Senate into dishonor and disrepute,” the social context in the country was nevertheless one of great anxiety.
Into that milieu, I blithely and naively sent a letter to the Soviet Embassy in Washington—along with a dozen or two similar letters to other embassies—seeking information on travel to and within the Soviet Union and what visa requirements a traveler might be expected to meet. I saved everything—copies and responses—neatly clipped in a file that I kept in the bottom drawer of my desk in my office. Well, that letter of inquiry to the Soviet Embassy precipitated a wide-ranging espionage investigation into me. I didn’t find out about it until just before my discharge, when my good friend and barracks bunk neighbor, Johnny Byrd, said to me, “Jack, I think I can tell you now that your case has been closed.”

MacArthur Fellow, and Former Assistant Administrator, U.S. EPA
“One of the best in a generation of outstanding leaders from both parties, Jack Schramm writes here about his fight for integrity in government, politics, policy, and society. Jack was a brilliant legislator who fought for the causes he believed in: justice, education, governance reform, environment, housing, income equality, and so much more. He was an activist who didn’t wait for change, but caused it. As a change agent with purpose, vision, and integrity, Jack’s book should inspire a new generation of change agents.
— BOB HOLDEN, former Governor of Missouri (D)
“The rule of law . . . politics . . . government service . . . insightful consulting. Few master any of these, but Jack Schramm mastered them all in his public career. When he didn’t find consensus, he created it. When others needed perspective, he crafted it. He never abandoned principle. Read Jack’s absorbing memoir and discover what his friends already know: He’s more than a politician who found multiple ways to serve. He is a man who has done good . . . and done it very, very well.”
— JOHN ASHFORD, Chairman, The Hawthorn Group—
International Public Affairs, Washington, D.C.
“In October 2010, Jack Schramm delivered the keynote address at Iraq’s first National Legislative Conference. His strategy for federal power-sharing influenced a debate that eventually resulted in a 2013 amendment clarifying provincial authority to make law, a significant step forward. Hopefully, other seeds that Jack planted in his highly skilled mentoring work in democratic governance will bear fruit there in Iraq in years to come.”
— LAMAR CRAVENS, former Chief of Party,
USAID’s Local Governance Program in Iraq
“Jack, an outstanding student of government, knew the rules and applied them successfully in passing consequential legislation on behalf of all Missourians. It was a joy to work with him. Read Jack’s journey and experience, too, the joy of an insightful governance adventure.”
— JIM CONWAY, former Mayor of St. Louis (D) and State Senator
“Schramm (is) considered one of the most effective legislators ever to sit in the Missouri House.”

Dedication
A
S I COMPLETE this retrospective of my adventure through life, and reflect on how deeply thankful I am for the opportunity to have experienced so many of its dimensions and to have learned so much, I have carefully considered whether there was any one human being whose contribution was so primal that it made everything possible for me. There is, in fact, one such person who deeply touched my life, or, I should say, made my life possible. That person is my maternal grandfather, Abraham Goruch. He was a highly respected family leader, to be sure, though he otherwise walked humbly through his life. But one fateful day in 1911, on his inhospitable home soil of Russia, he performed an extraordinary act of personal bravery in the face of a marauding Cossack band that threatened both him and the lives of his family. As recounted in the pages that follow, he instinctively, courageously, and selflessly rose to confront that fearful and imminent danger and, at great risk to himself, succeeded in protecting them from harm. In so doing, my grandfather changed the lives of his family and its descendants forever. That included my mother, then 10 years old, and, in turn, me. It is not that his brave act changed the quality of my life; it made my life possible. So in dedicating this book to him, I proudly and gratefully honor my grandfather who, in the most profound way, gave me both the gift of life itself and the inspiration to endeavor without surcease to put it to some useful purpose.
Acknowledgments
G
RATITUDE WITH A FULL HEART is first extended to my wife, Dorian, whose love, encouragement, and forbearance during the writing of this memoir never faltered. And to my talented nephew, Dean Schramm, a Hollywood literary agent and producer, learned in the writing and publishing arts, I shall always be grateful for wise counsel and unwavering encouragement. Paul Edwards, my Kansas City campaign manager and later, an author with his wife Sarah of 17 books, was enormously helpful with suggestions, edits, and contacts. I extend special thanks, also, to my publishers at New Insights Press, especially to managing editor Rick Benzel for his many editing improvements and for leading me through the publishing maze, and to art director Susan Shankin for her brilliant cover design and book layout. I am blessed with a large group of friends, many talented writers themselves, who, with care not to hurt my feelings too much, offered thoughtful and very helpful edits to the manuscript. I list them here (alphabetically) with heartfelt gratitude: Hilary Claggett, Wynne Cougill, Cliff Johnson (my Middle East motorcycle partner), Sheldon Novick (a biographer of note), Lonnie Shalton, Judith Slaughter, and Mary Allen Wilkes. And there were so many others, beloved family as well as friends around the world, who encouraged me to write it all down. They include a unique group of Missouri legislative friends, many named in the book, who, during our tenure, took the name, ROSD—or Royal Order of Shit Disturbers, which says it all. We still meet annually. The camaraderie is delicious.
Prologue
A
WORD ABOUT HOW this book came to be: As I moved through the winter of my professional life, I began to think that I might have at least one book in me. But I wasn’t thinking about any kind of memoir at all. I liked public policy and was kind of wonky about it; in fact, as I thought about a book, I thought that maybe I could organize one around a series of essays on the great issues of the day. The topics that came to mind included climate change, Israel-Palestine, the Electoral College, immigration reform, wherefore the United Nations, unbundling Islamic teachings, and the like. Plenty of stuff out there that excites peoples’ curiosity. But that’s as far as I got. I couldn’t get the project under way because I kept saying to myself, “Who cares what I think about these issues? There are lots of scholarly treatises about them.”
Word got around to my friends and colleagues about my writing project, and, assuming it was a memoir, they peppered me with questions about it. “Will you talk about your assignments to Iraq and living in Saddam’s palace and getting bitten by rats?” Or, “Will you reveal that your first marriage was in Tangier, Morocco after a shipboard romance?” Or, “Can you work in why those Pennsylvania legislative leaders complained about you to the White House?” Or, “You won’t omit that paratroop outing when your ‘chute finally decided to open at tree-top level?” Or, “Please tell everyone about how your Missouri legislative cabal, your Royal Order of Shit Disturbers, your ROSD—how they got that name!” Or, “I loved your motorcycle adventure from Baghdad through the Middle East; it will be great to finally get the whole story.” Or, “Tell us, are we still waiting, or did China ever implement your environmental recommendations?” Or, “It will be sad but memorable to recall that election night in ’72 when we waited for the returns to come in on your lieutenant governor’s race!” And on and on it went. My friends were all very excited to read about my political episodes, consulting on four continents, and personal adventures. Their enthusiasm was marvelous, and they assumed I would definitely write about my own life. But—again—that’s not where my head was. I had my doubts. Who, besides family and friends, would be interested?
Informal remarks on my life in governance at the 50th Reunion of our Washington University Law School class
Unless, I thought one day, I could use my experiences to impart something useful to a general audience, but especially those interested in politics and perhaps having a lengthy career, as mine has been, in government. Then, as I was pondering that question, I had something of an epiphany. It was staring me right in the face. My whole life had been devoted to governance in one form or another, whether executing it as an elected and appointed official or as a consultant in so many places around the world—if I could make governance my central theme, maybe it would work. And so the plan for this book began to take shape.
I could talk about my bumpy political journey and the governance insights I gleaned from my experiences at the state, federal, and international levels—and perhaps, I speculated, others would benefit from those insights as well. My life experience, as I stopped to think about it, was very broad and the stories at each level were rich in political intrigue, power trips, and, especially as to the international work, an insider’s look into what was happening behind the headlines. I could sketch out my early years and what forces formed my thoughts about government and contributing to better the world.
Though my school friends and I considered ourselves as American as apple pie, we were all first generation Americans, and we saw this country through the eyes of our ever-grateful parents and their friends. The influences were subtle but quite real, as were others in those formative years. When I went away to college, and later, I began to see differences in my peers—in our upbringing, our values, and our points of view about the world. For example, I never heard a negative word about President Franklin Roosevelt until I was a sophomore in college! He was practically worshipped by the adults in my early life. Those early years were when my values took shape—and my naiveté and sensitivities were challenged—and they became key to the directions I took in my later professional life. I had an adventure streak a mile wide and a curiosity about the unknown, what life was about beyond my neighborhood and schools. I explored, reached out and touched things I had experienced only in books. My military experience and my worldwide travel—I didn’t want to do what, or go where, everybody else did—taught me a great deal about self-reliance, experimentation . . . and the value of seeking. It was important that I talk about those things in my book as well; they contributed to how I got to be who I am, and why I think as I do. And they became governance values every bit as much as the experiences I had in my neighborhood growing up and during my education. I like to think of it all as context.
So, finally, I had a formula for a book. I was to be a vehicle—constructed uniquely from many parts, to be sure—to provide glimpses into how government worked at many different levels. I had to explain it through the only lens I knew—me. But it wasn’t to be just about me and all of my ego—but what I learned about governance—a distinction very important to me.
Moreover, I didn’t want it to be a textbook, for heaven’s sake. The glimpses and the lessons were simply to accompany my trip through life. They were not to be served up on a silver platter, but to be ingested in a natural flow with each course of my life’s various passages. I was blown off course several times—as have we all.
For me, each new course proved to be not only useful but purposeful. I think I have been fortunate in that regard, though I do believe that it is important that we not give up on trying to make our lives count for something in the larger scheme of things. If that comes through in this book, I would be proud to be the messenger, and maybe that’s lesson enough. I hope you will bear with me as I move through some of the substantive issues I encountered in my journey. I have tried not to be too technical or legalistic about those things, but I wanted to serve up some of the flavor of the work I did, both domestically and internationally, and I trust I have found a proper balance and not been too off-putting. I hope that there is something to be learned from the experiences I have had—about governance and other things. But you be the judge.
PART 1
VALUES AND THE FORMATIVE YEARS
ONE
First Generation Life in America
M
Y WORLD BEGAN at 1:45 a.m. on Thursday, January 21, 1932 at the Missouri Baptist Hospital in St. Louis—an Aquarian, as astrology would hold, who would see the world as one closely-related human family and would paint in broad strokes. And because I landed on the cusp of Capricorn, the stars further predicted that I was to be given strength of purpose and the fortitude to move my objectives forward. Both would later prove to be my strongest inner instincts, though, I also found, they were no guarantor of success.
I was the third of four sons, and we were born in couplets. The elder pair, Marvin and Norman (in that order), were born in the 1920s with their names reflecting a more traditional world. Seven years elapsed before I came along, followed 21 months later by brother Paul, our names reflecting perhaps a tilt toward modernity. Marv and Norman, perceived by us in those early years as much older, went off to serve in the armed forces during World War II. Paul and I, closer in age, shared more of life’s experiences. We were first generation Americans. I had no idea that this was a significant demographic until decades later. We were American as apple pie, strongly patriotic—and poor. We were, after all, in the middle of the Great Depression. But that characteristic was common to everyone we knew. My mother’s maiden name was Frieda Sylvia Goruch. Born in 1901, she was second eldest of four daughters and a son, born to Abraham and Rebecca Goruch (or Goruchovsky before it was anglicized). She lived in a shtetl just outside of Kiev in what is now Ukraine, but was then under Russian rule. Jews weren’t allowed to live within the boundaries of Kiev proper. She used to tell us that the floor of their home was bare earth. Everyone had a trade in the shtetls of the time, and my maternal grandfather (born in 1875) made his living as a tailor.
Pogroms were deadly and feared by the shtetl populations of Eastern Europe during those terrible years, particularly from 1880 through 1914 when anti-Semitism raged throughout the Russian Empire. It seemed that much of the blame for all the troubles of society was laid at the feet of the already ostracized Jews, and it would only get worse unless they found a way out of there. Ukrainian Russia, where my family lived, was somehow a particular hotbed for government-sanctioned pogroms, though the Czar vehemently denied any role on his part.
One fateful day in 1911 my mother’s settlement was attacked by marauding Russian Cossacks on horseback, one swooping in to assault my grandfather, then 33, and his family. Putting his family behind him, my grandfather ran forward to intercept the rider and threw him from his horse. Since resistance was not tolerated, my grandfather had to leave his family following the altercation and flee for his life! With the parting words, “I will get you out!” he made his way to Hamburg where he hid in a lifeboat on an ocean liner bound for New Orleans. Once there, he slipped off the ship and managed to follow the Mississippi River north up to St. Louis where other immigrants he knew had settled, including (helpfully) his father, who had peacefully, to use the word loosely, emigrated there in January 1909.
There were, of course, many other European immigrant groups in that era who were escaping from very difficult circumstances, but few who feared daily for their very safety as did the Jews of the time. In the case of my grandfather, it’s accurate to say that he was one of America’s early undocumented aliens. The memory of his story is seared into my conscience and unceasingly reminds me of my own personal commitment to supporting a proper solution to a significant item of America’s unfinished business—the plight of America’s current crop of undocumented aliens. It should be easily understood that the punishing experience of the Jewish Diaspora over two millennia has forged into the DNA of successive generations of Jews, down to the present one, a sensitivity to the plight of the downtrodden and a yearning for a just society. As events will bear out in this personal account, it is certainly there in mine, as imperfect in its expression as my fettered humanity has allowed. But it is unmistakably there. What America, cloaked in an ever struggling exceptionalism, so importantly adds to the mix is a unique collection of governance values—an exciting infusion of profound democratic community—that offers a realistic hope of perfecting such a society in the fullness of time.
In the old immigrant neighborhoods of St. Louis, my grandfather, resolutely trying to find his way, found an abandoned storefront on 6th Street which, as luck would have it, contained a scrapped sign in the back that read, “Buck the Tailor.” So, with that welcoming token bestowed no doubt by his guardian angels (whose work was pretty good so far), my brave and embattled grandfather became Buck the Tailor! He saved his nickels and dimes for two years at the trade he knew, and then sent for his family who had been holding their own with the help of friends and extended family on the outskirts of Kiev.
My grandmother’s family, and her sister’s family as well, eleven strong (six Goruchovsky’s and five Kranitzky’s) arrived in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on January 13, 1913. The Canadian Pacific Railroad then ushered them down to Detroit where they were admitted into the United States, finally, feeling absolutely incredulous over what was happening in their lives. Immigration officials, as they did with so many of the European unpronounceables, shortened my grandmother’s name from Goruchovsky to Goruch and her sister’s name from Kranitzky to Crane. They then traveled overland to St. Louis—my mother was 12—where they had a joyous reunion with my grandfather who, then, impatiently escorted them to his tailor shop where they would live for a time. It had a wooden floor! Happily re-unified, the family continued its struggle for survival, but at least in freedom in this new world of theirs—no small consideration if one stops to think about it, and, as I came to believe, one that we take for granted at our peril.
Many decades later, I had a consulting assignment in Kiev. Our threesome hailed a taxi and went to visit the Babi Yar Memorial, a ravine on the outskirts of the city. It was there that the Nazis, in their war against the Soviet Union, rounded up all the Jews in the Kiev region for what they said was transportation to another holding area. Then they were told to dig further into the ravine. Over the next two days, September 29th and 30th 1941, in a ruthless operation, Nazi Sonderkommandos murdered all 33,771 Jews who were gathered there—men, women, and children. It was one of the largest single massacres in the history of the Holocaust. Other later victims at the site included thousands of Soviet POWs, communists, Gypsies, Ukrainian nationalists, and civilian hostages. Estimates are that 100,000 to 150,000 lives were taken in that ravine.
I stood there looking at it, next to the memorial, in utter disbelief, trying to conjure up the abject terror that had been experienced there and which has become a bitter lesson in the failures of humanity. I was gripped by a realization, known casually as just family history before, but shockingly thrust into my consciousness in that moment: My mother and her family would have been totally wiped out in 1941 in that ravine had my grandfather not escaped himself and sent for them 28 years earlier. Maybe my father’s family as well. We knew the stories, but standing there right in the middle of the reality of it all was overwhelming. Why do some live and some die? It reinforced my deeply felt curiosity about such bewildering issues which had plagued me for years . . . and still do.
My father, Benjamin Jacob Schramm, was born in 1899 in Volhynia Gaberna, located maybe 175 miles west of Kiev in the northwest sector of present-day Ukraine. In alternating periods of time a part of Poland, Prussia, Austria, or Russia, it belonged to the Russian Empire when my father came onto the scene.
Second eldest of four children, my father was the only boy. The anglicized names of his parents were Frank and Ida Schramm. My paternal grandfather was born about 1870 and was a Talmud teacher and scholar. Interestingly, the name Schramm is a fairly common German name. German emigration to Volhynia Gaberna, mostly from Poland but also from some German provinces, grew to a population estimated at some 200,000 by the turn of the century. So somewhere down the line, my father’s forbears took on the same name of their Christian German neighbors—probably their landowners, in much the same way, I would guess, an African American bore the name of his ancestors’ slave owners. But conditions of the Volhynian Germans began to deteriorate in the late 19th century and thousand began to emigrate to both the United States and Canada.
My paternal grandfather, like so many of his Volhynian German neighbors, took his family and emigrated to America in 1905, and made their way to St. Louis also. My father was just six. Once in St. Louis, my grandparents on both sides, still unknown to one another, settled into life—the Goruches (my grandfather finally succumbed to the practicalities of this shortened version) on Carr Street and the Schramms in a nearby neighborhood—in what is now downtown St. Louis. This is the area where most of the Eastern European immigrants gathered. Some called it a Jewish ghetto, not unlike the living habits that had been forced upon them for centuries in the shtetls of the Eastern European diaspora. It was a mutual protection and comfort thing.
My father was a good student, especially in math, and made it through the eighth grade. My mother went through the fifth grade, and left school to help out at home. A love of music, and an aptitude for its expression led my father to violin lessons. He developed a real flair for technique but his passion was especially evident as he pursed his lips and leaned forward, his body and bow arm in rhythmic synchronicity, surging from dulcet to brio on both instrument and brow, as he transited the emotional phrasing in a sweeping melody of Tchaikovsky or Beethoven. My father was in charge and ecstatic when he was doing his music—his thing. It showed on his face. It was good to see, as he didn’t have that kind of happiness—in a protracted sense—as the years wore on.
The early years were better and more promising. It was inevitable that my father would become a professional musician—and an accomplished one. Professional opportunities began to come, and he found himself organizing and leading small groups of musicians for weddings and other functions.
As he broke into his twenties, buoyed by his music and feeling lighthearted, he was emboldened to turn to matters of the heart. He met Frieda Goruch, a beautiful young girl with a pug nose and regular Slavic-like features. She agreed to accompany him on some of his playing engagements, sitting off to the side and proudly watching her boyfriend entertain all those strangers. It was kind of exciting for them both. Unable to deny their love for each other, they married in 1920—he was 21 and she 19. Thus began the tumultuous life of Ben and Frieda Schramm.
Marvin arrived in 1922 and Norman in 1924. The Roaring 20’s was a time of opportunity for musicians, perhaps the most successful time of my father’s life, as he was engaged to play dinner music at the (still) fashionable Chase Hotel. A large black sign with silver glitter letters reading “Ben Schramm and his Orchestra” hung over the stage—and he kept that sign for all the ensuing decades of his life in a closet wherever he lived.
In 1927, and feeling ready, my parents emigrated from the City of St. Louis to the County of St. Louis (two different jurisdictions). They wanted to be where the rest of the Jewish community was moving—into the adjoining suburb of University City (so named because it abutted Washington University in St. Louis and many of its streets were named for universities: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, Tulane, Colgate, Dartmouth, the more prominent ones). The family lived in three apartments over the next nine years. The stock market crashed in 1929 and the depression had engulfed everyone.
My father’s music business crashed, too. He tried to open up a dry cleaning business, but he refused to pay protection to the mob—so they threw a bomb through his window and that ended that. My mother thought she had to do something to earn some money, so she bought some hosiery and underwear at discount prices and then sold them to the employees at several hotels who agreed to the purchases if they could pay for them a little each week. So she marked up the articles and sold them at a profit. She began regular collections for these sales. And her business grew to include furniture and appliances and a retail store owner backed her with merchandise.
Her customers were all in the black community, and this kind of arrangement was the only way they could afford those necessities. She was trailblazing, one could argue, the credit card economy we have today. She didn’t know it, but she also had started the feminist movement.
As my mother was getting underway in her business, we moved to our fourth apartment in 1936. I was four. All of these apartments were located in an area called the Delmar Loop, so named because it was the streetcar turnaround for the westernmost reach of the then ‘mass transit’ system of St. Louis. Our new apartment was a third floor walkup at 6319 Delmar Boulevard, right on the main drag. The Loop was U. City’s business district and stretched for about eight blocks beyond the city line.
At the far end of the business district was Delmar-Harvard Grade School (at the corner of Delmar and Harvard Avenue), where brother Paul and I attended grade school. My political career started in kindergarten where my teachers (Miss Olmstead and Miss Iseley—I’ll never forget them) appointed me the fire chief of a red fire wagon that we had built. I remember being surprised. From humble beginnings and all that . . . .
Times were still tough for everyone in the Loop. FDR and the federal government created the Works Progress Administration (or WPA as it was popularly known) in 1935 to preserve the skills and self-respect of the working people of America. It lasted until 1943. They did everything—from infrastructure to the arts. It included the creation of the WPA symphony orchestra that played every week in University City’s Heman Park. My father signed up as a violinist, as did many of his musician friends. We frequently went to listen to the orchestra on a summer evening. My father earned about $90.00 a month, which helped with the rent, while my mother earned the grocery money.
We lived in that Delmar apartment all the way through my first year of law school. It was home. Early on, my mother’s credit business attracted other entrants—all men. About a dozen of them banded together, along with my mother (the only woman), to pool their purchasing power so that they could buy their merchandise at favorable prices. Mom held her own with the men—and her boys were proud of her, though we didn’t quite realize how extraordinary she was. The family members—all of us—just forged ahead with our lives. And enjoyed the dinners she cooked for us every evening, which we just took for granted.
My father never seemed to be able to get a toehold in business, and tried several ventures into the 1940’s. He was an artist, not a businessman, and seemed very unhappy most of the time. He was able to join several community orchestras, the first in University City and the second in Kirkwood (another suburb), and I truly think those were lifesavers for him.
One day when I was about 10, I got a look at life in the raw. My mother hired one of her customers, Margaret, to clean the house once a week to pick up the slack for her. Margaret was like one of the family. On a warm sunny day, Margaret asked if I would like a root beer—a real treat because I knew it meant going down the street to visit Blondie & Dick’s Root Beer Stand, an outdoor arrangement vividly painted in orange and black, and extremely popular in the Loop. We were seated at the bar and there were no other customers. Margaret paid for a large mug and I chugged most of it down but couldn’t finish it, so I passed it over to Margaret and asked her to finish it for me. She smiled, put the mug to her lips, and no sooner had she done that, when Blondie appeared—she startled me—and snatched the mug right out of Margaret’s hands, saying, “Sorry!”
I was only a little guy, but I was dumbstruck! I knew what had happened but could hardly believe it. Margaret was denied service by Blondie because, and only because, she was black (“African American” wasn’t in vogue yet). Margaret was hurt. I could tell it, but she held onto her dignity. I hurt, too, for Margaret, and was so very embarrassed. It just wasn’t right, I remembered thinking. We walked home in silence, but that scene remained with me throughout my life, and has informed my conscience on matters of race whenever it was in my power to do something about it. I didn’t yet know what politics was about but I believe we all face character-building moments, as this one was for me, and we either experience some kind of propulsion within us that directs us to want to make change, or we don’t. Whoever is in charge of imprinting consciences found an easy mark in me.
Little by little I began to develop a notion about how people should treat one another. I was a bit shy and serious—but proud. Not flashy or show-offy proud. But I wanted to be upstanding and didn’t want to be criticized for not doing the right thing. I then had a personal experience as a youngster that challenged my self-righteousness, if I can call it that. Every Jewish kid in my generation experienced prejudice at one time or another. Every one.
On one occasion, I was forced into a physical fight—the only one I ever had. I was only about 11. About five neighbor kids, including my brother Paul and me, went over to have some fun at an abandoned construction site nearby. We weren’t there five minutes when five older boys suddenly appeared; they were from nearby Christ the King parochial school, who were notorious for seeking out “Jew-boy Christ-killers” and beating them up. They let it be known that we were their targets. Our little group fled wildly down the hill—except me. I was too proud to run, though I don’t know what came over me. I just stood there frozen to the ground. Brother Paul was frantically calling to me to run.
The bullies selected one of their number to do the honors. Meanwhile, Paul and the other kids ran home and screamed at my brother Norman (who was 17 or 18) ‘to come rescue Jack who was getting beaten up.’ Norm rushed back with the other kids, and we were still grappling. But Norman was the equalizer and, for the sake of everyone’s pride, I guess it was, wisely asked if we wanted to fight it out, and we both nodded yes, almost automatically. To tell the truth, I wasn’t so sure. But, knowing it would now be a fair fight, and the others wouldn’t pile on, I was energized and became very aggressive, slugging the guy. After a bit, I yelled, “Tell me when you’ve had enough!” And he finally did. The bullies made a fast exit, and I remember the triumphant walk home, Norman, with his arm around my shoulder, beaming down at his little brother.
The ferocity of anti-Semitism has moderated with the passing of each generation—from the shtetls and Holocaust of my grandparents’ and parents’ time, to the present where it is certainly the case that our children have been less exposed to this mindless hatred. But it’s still out there, perhaps worse in the subtler (and sometimes not so subtle) expressions of racial bias experienced by African Americans. And today the LGBT community and Latinos are experiencing some of the same kinds of senseless hatred that stands in the way of love and acceptance of our fellow human beings. Although, over time, we assuredly have done better, we should hope that the trajectory improves.
So, if one is born into a cauldron of “them” and “us,” attitudes are shaped. Certainly mine were shaped—as one of “them”—by personally witnessing and experiencing, even at a tender age, the callousness of hatred, the damage it inflicts, and the sorrow it leaves behind. I cannot square it with any concept of cosmic morality that I have encountered. Others may be born into, and come to identify with a culture of “us vs. them.” It must be very difficult to wrest one’s mind from this kind of negativity and the divisiveness that those influences tend to weave into one’s DNA. The struggle between these two forces has been played out in America since our beginnings as we try to “form a more perfect union.” I happen to believe that the expansion of personal liberties will continue, but those of like mind will need to persevere to make it happen.
Nowadays the “other side,” to put it gently, is more sophisticated in its discrimination. It couches its lack of concern for “them” in the polemics of such phantoms as fear of takeover (reflected in restrictive immigration policy and absence of gun control), fear of abuse (reflected in hobbled voting rights ), Biblical injunction (reflected in restraints on LGBT rights, women’s rights), big government intrusiveness (reflected in seeking an unshackling from economic, environmental, and all manner of regulation), and constitutional exhortation (using the Constitution to restrict rather than enlarge rights—such as using the 10th Amendment ‘powers reserved to the states’ clause to de-fang Federal jurisdiction or the 14th Amendment ‘due process’ clause to undo abortion rights).
TWO
Political Nascence: The Fledgling Years
S
EVERAL YEARS AGO when I joined my classmates in St. Louis for the 50th reunion of our graduation from the Washington University School of Law, we were asked to explain the circumstances surrounding our decision to study law and what our legal careers were all about. When my turn came, I said I had wanted to become a lawyer since the age of 12, but that my principal motivation was not so much to practice but rather to make law. I didn’t know where that came from, I joked, unless I had been in the Roman Senate in a previous life. The way politics gripped my life throughout my school years, and ineluctably directed me toward politics later, has made me wonder where in the world that inner drive and motivation truly came from.
Even in my neighborhood growing up, and still in grade school, I seemed to have had a penchant for organizing things. It wasn’t anything special, and I didn’t attach any significance to it. I suggested stuff and the kids just followed along. For example, I organized a “Bike Patrol,” looking for I don’t know what, evil-doers, I suppose. Also an “army” of 12 young stalwarts—and I was the general, of course. This was during World War II and we even did hikes as training maneuvers and “played guns.” The NRA would have been proud! Probably the most fun was the cork ball league I organized where St. Louis kids (it’s the only place it’s played) learned to hit lightning fast balls and curves, thrown with a tennis ball, with a sawed-off broomstick. And that morphed into a fast pitch baseball team that I organized to play against other neighborhood teams, all before we were in high school. We used to create our own amusements as there were no professional youth organizers or clubs in the 1940s.
My 7th to 9th grade happened at Ward Junior High School. As we reached the end of the 8th grade and the election of next year’s student council president loomed, I found myself a candidate, at the behest of some friends. It was 1945 and the world was consumed by the prospect of World War II coming to an end. The surrender of Germany and Japan (the latter prompted by the use of atomic weapons) was only a few months off. So in my speech to the student body, I spoke of the scourge of war and how we had to be steadfast in the face of its challenges. Never mind what I would do for the school, if elected. I was only 13, had just been bar mitzvahed a few months earlier and obviously had taken the Hebrew injunction of Tikun Olam (Repair the World) perhaps too seriously, for this election anyway. But so it would be for the rest of my life. Well, I won the election (my first), and I was teasingly reminded of that speech by classmates as many as 30 years later! In this, I learned that if you can’t do relevance, memorable is good!
The next phase of my busy life took place at University City Senior High School. From ages 15 through 17, everything was new and wonderful, and included sports, fraternities, dating, and school politics, too. Sports, especially, consumed me. I was good at baseball and lettered in all three of my high school years. I also played American Legion baseball and in summer industrial leagues—with and against players who went to the major leagues.
Then there were clubs, the school newspaper, and, of course, the student council. My home room class elected me to the student council in the 10th grade. I worked hard in my studies and became a self-starter as I knew help from home was unlikely. Academically, I was above average and finally made the honor roll in my last couple of semesters. Grades were truly earned in those days the hard way.
The end of the 11th grade came and, with it, campaign time for the office of student body president for our senior year. Or, to be more precise, for the first half of our senior year; the school administration thought it best to share this school honor between two students, one for each semester. Again, friends urged me to run. I would never have run without their encouragement, as my shy self would have thought it too presumptuous to run otherwise. Election day came and we gave our speeches. I don’t remember what I said, but I won (or maybe my campaign manager, Chuck Walker, won; he gave a very entertaining speech). So, on this one, I learned that if you can’t do substance, entertainment is good!
Senior year came, and it was an exciting one. Presiding over the student council and its work, chair of the Junior-Senior Prom Committee, I was also selected (I don’t remember how) to be Mayor of University City for a Day. I continued to take everything seriously. One day, Miss Briscoe, our student council faculty sponsor, gently nudged me not to overdo it by saying, “Jack, I heard one girl say that she would love it if you would just smile!” Notwithstanding, in the final tallies for senior class ‘most this and that,’ Dick Dutton, student body president in the second semester, and I tied as “Most Popular Boy.” So maybe it was okay to be serious-minded!
Of course, during senior year, the thoughts of almost all of my classmates turned to college—where would we go? U. City High School had developed a sterling reputation in the university community as among the best high schools in St. Louis County—and there were dozens. About 90% of its graduates went on to college. Everyone was expected to. Most of us were first generation Americans and “People of the Book,” and we knew that education was a path to the American dream. It was 1949. The Great Depression and World War II both had ended, and I instinctively felt that education would help me accomplish things that were beginning to stir deeply within me. For those of us living in the Delmar Loop especially, we couldn’t wait to get started.
Since Princeton and Harvard took our academic stars, it was hard for me not to dream, too, about going to an Eastern college. My family certainly could not afford it. So while I was awaiting some celestial guidance, the admissions dean from Colgate University in Hamilton, New York decided to visit our high school for the first time, based on our reputation. I attended—and was hooked by pictures of the beautiful campus in a small town, an all-male student body of only 1,300, the core curriculum of philosophy and religion, public affairs, the study of an alternative culture, but mostly by the prospect of joining the Washington Study Group for a semester of studying the federal government right there in its offices. Though it was late in the season, I sent for an application and, shortly thereafter, was contacted by Tom DePew, Colgate’s college advisor for St. Louis. We hit it off famously. A successful businessman, Tom always wanted to help deserving people, often saying to me throughout the course of a lifelong friendship, “We’ve got to help them, Jack!” I didn’t realize at the time that I was one of his early projects. He proved to be one of the most decent people I have ever known.
I needed a scholarship and Tom went to bat for me to be sure I received one. What I didn’t know until well after I had graduated was that I had applied too late for financial aid for my freshman year, and that Tom had arranged with the school to pay for my freshman year himself. He really wanted me to go to Colgate! (I have since established a scholarship at Colgate as a way of repaying Tom’s poignant and indelible kindness.) My record after my first year persuaded Colgate, going forward, to cover my annual tuition and provide work in the library and dining facilities to defray room and board. This amounted to two-thirds of the cost of attending, or $1,600.00 per year. My parents footed the remaining third, or $800.00. How things have changed, as fellow parents will attest!
My freshman year at Colgate was exciting. I made lots of friends, pledged Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, one of the more popular ones, and in contravention of its ‘only for Christians’ clause. Again, I was asked to run for freshman class president by friends. As I recall, my speech was about how all of us should receive invitations to the fraternities, as Princeton had done for its eating clubs, because those who were left out (about 15% of the class) truly missed an important social dimension offered by the college. The idea was that if one was good enough to be admitted to the college, he was good enough to be admitted to a fraternity. I won the election. It was then that I knew I would be elected Student Senate president for my senior year. And that’s what happened. It was a strange feeling because it was almost as if I could will my success in these elections. My arrogance would get its comeuppance as time went on, but I was feeling my oats at the time.
My life at Colgate was truly fulfilling. After the freshman class presidency, my fraternity thought I should represent it in the Student Senate, which served only to whet my appetite for more. “Politics” is the word commonly used to describe this kind of activity, but I didn’t use the term. I thought it was much more like a responsibility that one should exercise on behalf of one’s fellows. I was still possessed of that serious and very idealistic turn of mind. After my sophomore year, I won a scholarship from the Experiment in International Living to spend the summer in Morelia, Mexico living with a Mexican family, where I soaked up the culture and language, and broadened my vistas. With courses in International Law and International Organization, I was really getting turned on to the international scene.
During my junior year, my international affairs professor, Dr. Robert Elder, had me appointed to two inter-collegiate positions that would further excite my interest in international policy. The first was as president of the Upstate New York Model United Nations Security Council, comprised of eleven regional universities, which I found intriguing. The second appointment, somewhat more challenging, was as a Main Committee chair at meetings of the Mid-Atlantic Model United Nations General Assembly being held, of all places, at the United Nations Building in New York City. Well, let me tell you—how could a young person not be impressed by conducting even faux UN business in the ECOSOC Chamber itself!
Apparently I was not so bad at doing presiding officer stuff because, at the close of our three day meetings, and in the session where the participants (representing some 60 colleges and universities from the Mid-Atlantic states) were to select the presiding officers for the following year’s session, I was elected to serve as president of the General Assembly. Again, I thought to myself, what is going on here?
Back at Colgate, at the end of my junior year, I was elected student body president and presided over the Student Senate for the first semester of my senior year, but had to turn the gavel over to the vice president (Vail Taylor, a wonderful and deservedly well-respected guy) in the second semester so I could spend that semester in Washington, D.C. with the Washington Study Group. But I had an insight during a philosophy course with Dr. Holmes Hartshorne during that first semester that has remained with me throughout my political life. Dr. Hartshorne explained the American political experience as a national commitment to the autonomous individual. “Well, what does that mean,” he probed?
“Autonomous,” he explained, “derives from two Greek words: ‘autos’ meaning self and ‘nomos’ meaning reason or order. Thus, the self-reasoning or self-ordered individual.”
Then Dr. Hartshorne went on to apply this fundamental concept to our political parties. “The Republicans,” he explained, “emphasize the ‘autos’ or self and are identified with free private enterprise, the values of liberty, and untrammeled, to the extent possible, individual expression. And, for their part, Democrats emphasize the ‘nomos’ and thus are more identified with the reasonable use of government to achieve order and social welfare, emphasizing the equality of individuals in the process. But each carries the seeds and values of the other so that they both can lay claim to a commitment to the autonomous individual. Thus, while Republicans want to reduce regulation and allow Wall Street and the banks to exercise their financial and business creativity for the benefit of all, they would be hesitant to overturn the ‘nomos’ dimension of the equation as represented by Social Security or perhaps other social measures.”
“And the Democrats,” Dr. Hartshorne continued, “although fully committed to the beneficial uses of government as reflected in the ‘nomos’ dimension of this equation, are at the same time committed to the private enterprise system, liberty, and private expression as reflected in the ‘autos,’ perhaps not as ardently as the Republicans, but it is a strongly shared value nonetheless.”
That little insight, as explained by Dr. Hartshorne, was an epiphany for me, and I have carried those words with me throughout my life. They are a great summary of American political life. To me, they mean that we are a nation of shared values. There is more that unites us than divides us. Our differences are a matter of degree. The American political process of transparency and openly debating our differences is designed to allow us to glimpse what the other guy is thinking, to understand it even if we don’t agree with it, and to work to resolve our differences in a peaceful way. The “autonomous individual”—this way of thinking about who we are—is a notion that encapsulates our common worth and has always brought us together in times of national stress. It has kept me sane.
My final semester in Washington, D.C. was a memorable experience! We were ten students, both seniors and juniors, and, as it happened, split down the middle politically—five Republicans and five Democrats. By this time, I knew that my heart was firmly planted on the Democratic side of the aisle. I was able to sharpen my debating skills as we argued all the time, even on the trolley every morning as we headed up to the Capitol from the YMCA where we stayed. That was my first taste of anyone daring to articulate to my face a difference with the way I saw the world! I was comfortable with my views and initially wondered how in the world they—my classmates—could come to such different conclusions. Didn’t we have the same facts and concerns? Well, needless to say, I got quite an education in public policy from my Republican friends. A shot across my naïve bow! What a politically sheltered life I had led!
It was 1953 and Dwight Eisenhower was president, having defeated Adlai Stevenson—such a refined, intelligent fellow, I remember musing—the year before. The semester was eye-opening at so many levels—from a visit in the White House to interview Ike’s press secretary; to a personal interview with Vice President Richard Nixon; to a period of study in the State Department (as a group) and then the Department of Labor (we each had to choose an agency); and, finally, in connection with our study of Congress, its members, and the legislative process, to some three weeks or so as an intern in our own congressman’s office—mine was Representative Tom Curtis, a Republican representing the greater part of St. Louis County. I remember thinking to myself that, someday, I would run for that selfsame seat—and I did some 23 years later, in 1976. Clearly, by this time, I had an undeniable feeling that politics was to be my calling.
Midway through the semester, Dr. Elder and I took a long weekend off to head to Ithaca, N.Y, where I was to assume my responsibilities as President of the Mid-Atlantic Model UN General Assembly. It was to convene at the Cornell Law School. I worked closely, and also shared a dormitory room, with Peter Kenen, a Columbia University student who had been selected to be the Secretary-General. I addressed him as “Peter” and he addressed me as “Your Excellency.” Peter was brilliant and played his role to the hilt. He later received his doctorate at Harvard and, from 1971 through 2004, was the Walker Professor of Economics and International Finance at Princeton and became internationally renowned.
By that time, I had presided over so many student groups that I remember having felt fairly confident and comfortable in managing the flow of debate and occasionally interceding to push along the resolution of an issue. It was a confidence-builder for me and a very satisfying learning experience. When we were packing up to go home following a crowded few days of international problem-solving with wonderfully creative peers—we all wished that we could have had a real go at these issues—Dr. Elder, with whom I had developed a warm relationship, privately whispered to me, “Jack, when you get into this work for real, don’t forget to contact me for consulting purposes!” Given the knowledge imbalance between my professor and me, that he would suggest that I hire him some day—did I really hear what I heard? Though stunned, I was secretly very pleased with what I was doing to warrant Dr. Elder’s confidence.
Dr. Elder and I returned to the program in Washington, concluded our semester’s work in May, and returned to campus to prepare for graduation for those of us who were seniors. I finished my academics with a deep major in political science and two minors—one in philosophy and one in Spanish, both of which I truly relished. I sat with the political science faculty for the departmental honors exam, a daunting exercise! My GPA put me in the top 10% of my class which qualified me for the honors exam with cum laude standing. It could have been magna but for a few C’s in my first couple of semesters while I was learning how to study at the college level. A leak that a faculty friend coaxed out of several political science faculty colleagues revealed to our collective glee that my oral exam was of high honors caliber. But I was delighted, after all was said and done, to graduate Cum Laude with Honors in Political Science from a place like Colgate; I also felt honored to have been admitted to both the junior and senior honorary societies and to have been awarded a George W. Cobb Fellowship for leadership. More than delighted for a boy from the Delmar Loop.
THREE
The Influences of Law School and Military Service
I
WAS ADMITTED TO the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis where I began my first year of legal studies in the Fall of 1953. I lived at home in the Loop, could walk to classes, and had a scholarship loan from the St. Louis Scholarship Foundation. It was good not to be a further financial burden to my parents, who were busy helping my brother Paul through undergraduate school, and later law school, at the University of Missouri-Columbia, some 120 miles away. To have the credential—a law degree—was an enthralling prospect for me.
What a budding lawyer learns from the very beginning is the necessity of finding the core issue of a problem at the very outset of a dispute, how to express it and be right about it. It is necessary in this kind of analysis to put aside any coloration of the issue, whether based in emotion or philosophy, and see it as it is—the reality of the matter in the bright light of day. Being clear-eyed about a problem’s core issues and dimensions is the sine qua non to its satisfactory resolution. Resorting to morality and philosophy are fine when addressing the resolution question, but it is imperative to be realistic about the fundamental problem you are faced with.
I have always felt that the study of the law was an excellent preparation for a career in politics or in the development or execution of public policy. To be sure, one can learn to be an effective public practitioner through other professional disciplines, but, at least in my opinion, the best preparation for a socio-legal gap analysis and the application of an apt legislative solution is legal training. I hasten to add, however, that I think it would be a mistake to have a legislative body solely comprised of lawyers. A policy-making body benefits from a wide range of life experiences. For me and my inclinations though, I was satisfied that legal training would best equip me for public policy analysis and leadership.
We learned all about research methods and how to use the library in that first year. We didn’t have computers then and no access to lightning fast answers to majority and minority rules in any given jurisdiction. Instead we plowed through the books, took copious notes on what we found, painstakingly “shepardized” our cases, as we called it, to ensure that their holdings had not been later overruled or amended, and then laboriously hunt-and-pecked on our old typewriters to complete our research papers.
Well into my second semester, I started to think hard about the final two years of law school, and especially about the prospect of piling up further debt through the scholarship loan, which was still available to me. The GI Bill was another option open to me but only for a few more months since the Korean War was in the process of officially winding down in 1954. I decided to go for it. I kept my own counsel in this process, as I did for most things—master of my own fate kind of thing. This was characteristic of all of my collegiate decision-making, and truly felt throughout my life that I was the one, the only one, really in charge of my destiny. Not to be too dramatic about it, but I felt that I was the one to take my fate—my own fate—into my own hands, that no one could do for me what I was supposed to do for myself.
Truth be told, I had something of an adventurous streak within me. It was related to my natural curiosity and extended to unknown things, places, and experiences, sort of a fascination with things beyond my ken. This curiosity about the unknown later led me to spiritual places that helped me come to terms with my place in the world, and to accept both my disappointments and successes with equanimity—a sense of balance and calm.
In that broader connection, I always both admired and envied my genius nephew, David Schramm (a 6’4” red-headed giant of a man and eldest son of brother Marvin), who was short-listed for a Nobel in astrophysics before his untimely accidental death in 1997 at the age of 52, flying his own plane (having picked up the love of flying airplanes from his father). A physical as well as an intellectual adventurer, Dave climbed mountains on every continent, except Antarctica, despite having several near-death experiences. He learned the rough and tumble side of life as an all-state wrestler as a Missouri high school senior and as a New England heavyweight wrestling champion when he was at MIT. Nearly made the Olympic team, too.
In his other life, David, former chairman of the Department of Astrophysics at the University of Chicago and manager of the Fermilab there, and ever the adventurer, aggressively plumbed the depths of the cosmos, and its Black Holes. In that pursuit, he did much to unite cosmic mysteries with those of particle physics, and found, in this unity, a greater understanding of the Big Bang of creation and the now accepted concept of an ever-expanding universe that followed.
A New York Times remembrance essay by Dennis Overbye following Dave’s death reported that the science community was stunned “that a man described as a force of nature could be gone.” Added British theoretical physicist Stephen W. Hawking, for whom Dave served as best man at his wedding, “. . . David was larger than life in so many ways.” David was looking for ultimate answers—the biggest “why” of all. I am sure that in the quiet confines of his lab, he had an “aha” moment or two, and I would so much like to have seen what Dave saw. I have often wondered if, as the poet John Magee said, he had “touched the face of God.” Doubtless, he has the answers now—and so will we all, some day.
I don’t know if there is an “adventure” gene in some members of the Schramm clan or not (although, in retrospect, as I look at my brothers and some of their offspring, and my own, I might perhaps be persuaded!). Be that as it may, as I stood there in 1954 facing whatever the future held for me, I didn’t know, nor could I, what astonishing dimensions my life would assume in the next few years.
My peers and I had registered for the draft each year beginning at age 18, and those of us in college, like me, had received deferments. So, having decided to take the plunge, I volunteered for the draft, as the procedure was called, and found myself being sworn into the army as a recruit on August 30, 1954. I was 22.
Off they sent me to Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, where I endured eight weeks of basic training, followed by another eight weeks of field artillery training. There, I learned to fire and clean all manner of firearms. Those drill sergeants were a breed apart, but I learned an unforgettable life lesson from their often raging, if not bullying, insistence on just about everything—that “there are no excuses; just get the job done, dammit!” The phrase clearly suits the military mission, but is not bad for the rest of us, too. Like most young people, I had often found a reason to put something off. Thereafter, however, I heard the demands of my drill sergeants ringing in my ears, making me feel compulsive at times.
And, when Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, published her book Lean In in 2012 urging that women take charge of their own lives and, as part of her charge, advising them (and everyone else, for that matter) to “relentlessly prioritize,” I felt an instant resonating connection between her call for urgency in the workplace and that demanded by my drill sergeants, both urging execution and achievement in the face of difficult tasks to be accomplished. Good lessons find ways to reinforce themselves.
Thus, I reconciled the seeming competition between my astrological predilections: Capricorn’s impulse to get the lead out is given direction by my Aquarian why-and-wherefore inquiries to get the humanitarian policy focus right. I’ve always been comfortable with that personality setting.
We were all then to be shipped off for further training, but we had some say-so in the matter. One of the options was to go airborne—strictly for volunteers. I thought that if I had to go into combat, I wanted to be with folks who were better trained for it and good warriors. And then, the adventure streak kicked in, and the thought that followed was that this could really be interesting and challenging and maybe even fun. So, without pondering it further, I volunteered, and was promptly shipped off to the 11th Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, not quite knowing what to expect. The paratroopers there made an immediate impression on me. For one thing, they seemed bigger; for another, their fatigues were starched, pressed, and spotless, and their bloused boots were polished like a mirror. These guys were proud. I liked that.
After processing, I was assigned to the 675 Airborne Field Artillery Battalion, and my company commander was 1st Lt. “Tiger” Jones who virtually growled his orders. His top sergeant was Sgt. DeLaskey whose face looked like my boxer, but who had a gentler side, I later discovered, which he kept well hidden. This was to be my home unit at Fort Campbell, but the first order of business was our airborne training. Actually, the first order of business was PT—physical training. It preceded everything an airborne unit did. We ran for miles at a time, often to a rhythmic cadence sounded off by our trainers. We did hundreds of pushups in a day, usually 20 at a time, interspersed with other forms of calisthenics. We did palms-out pullups, which I had never been able to do before. If a guy was out of sync in an exercise count, he was immediately identified and an order crisply issued, “Drop for 20, soldier!”
What I truly admired and will never forget is the time when the drill sergeant, who was up on a platform and doing all of the calisthenics with us, screwed up his own count, and volunteered, “My mistake! At ease! I will drop for 20,” at which point he dropped to do 20 pushups while the rest of us stood in formation, feet spread, hands clasped behind our backs, watching in stony silence—and with utter respect. If one ever had cause to wonder how these elite units develop such camaraderie and self-sacrifice in their ranks, this is one small illustration. With this physical routine every day, I never harbored any doubt that this was the best physical shape I had ever been in either before or since that time.
Doubtless, the most gratifying consequence of my assignment to this unit was meeting Bill Claggett. Bill had been in the service three or four months longer than I, had been earlier discovered by Sgt. DeLaskey and worked for him as the battery clerk. Bill, from Dayton, Ohio, had two Harvard degrees in city planning and was later to have a great career as a government advisor, professor, and consultant. Bill and I grew close as brothers and became lifelong friends.
Our airborne training proceeded apace. We practiced Parachute Landing Falls—PLFs as we called them—jumping hundreds of times from four foot platforms, learning how to distribute our weight as we hit the ground. Then they had a contraption about three stories high, sort of like a fire tower, where you strapped yourself into a parachute harness with lines attached to a cable above, waited for a jump command, and then threw yourself out of the door trying to keep a tight body position as you were sharply caught by the cable above and your legs fought the restraining harness that wanted to wrench them outward, all the while being zip-wired down to an end-point about fifty yards off.
The idea was to teach us, upon exiting an airplane, to maintain a tight body position—head down, arms clutching your reserve chute below your chest with your right palm over the D-ring, and legs bent slightly but absolutely together—no matter what air pressures were attempting to drive your members apart. If you couldn’t keep your legs together when jumping the tower—and it hurt to do so—then you had to do the tower way more than you wanted to.
After weeks of PT and jump school practice, we finally reached show time—an actual jump. I kept a Jump Log for all sixteen jumps that I made in the service, which identified the date, the drop zone, my stick position, the type of jump, and remarks about any unique features of the jump. All troopers have jump stories, and I would be no different.
March 7, 1955 arrived to mark the first of five qualifying jumps which is the number required to earn your airborne wings. (And I have mine to this day.) All of our jumps were to be from a C-119 aircraft, which looks like a bee and, aerodynamically, is not supposed to be able to fly—a body that looks too big for its wings to carry. But it flew. As battery clerk, Claggett was in charge of preparing the flight manifests—and he did me the dubious favor of placing me in the number one position in four of the five qualifying jumps (number two for the fifth).
That meant I was to be the first one to exit the aircraft from the port side. I was scared dizzy when we took off and, despite the earlier and easy bravado, said to myself, “Just what in the hell am I doing here?” Sitting next to the open port door, I could see the countryside below grow smaller as we climbed to our jump altitude of 1200 feet that day. The jump location was scheduled for the Yamoto Drop Zone (the DZs were named after combat jump locations during World War II).
We flew for about ten uneasy minutes before the jumpmaster began shouting the preparatory jump commands into the intercom: “Stand up and hook up!” was the first. We were lined up in two sticks facing the port and starboard doors. You could hear the clicks of all the static lines hooking onto the eye-level cables that ran the length of the plane for each stick. “Check your equipment!” was the next. We made sure that the static line of the trooper directly in front of us was free and clear of any obstruction and then lamely looked up and down our own harnesses to make sure we were all snapped in. Then the jumpmaster called off the landmarks below: “Highway 41 comin’ up!” A heart-pounding moment later, it was, “Stand in the door!” and I automatically pivoted into the open door, hands slapped against the outside of the plane, the icy air running across my knuckles, my legs bent slightly and then involuntarily giving way to the fear that gripped me, my head staring straight ahead, my last thought being, “I can’t believe I’m doing this!” as my mind then went absolutely blank and switched to auto pilot.
Then the last terrifying command came, as I felt the jumpmaster’s hand whack my rump, “Go!” he shouted, and I went, hurtling down as if in a howling hurricane, the prop wash pitching me into its wake nearly upside down, completely disoriented but trying to keep my body all buttoned up, the roar of the motors much louder on the outside! We were trained to begin a fourcount immediately, and I did: “Hup thousand! Two Thousand! Three Thousand! Four Thousand!” And all of a sudden, it was ghostly quiet! No wind, no motors, no point of reference on a first jump. I didn’t know what to expect. We were instructed to check the parachute canopy after the four-count, so I looked up: it was fully deployed, and I whispered, “Thank you, God!” I was able then to take stock. I felt all alone, pinned to the sky, and euphoric. The 50-60 second ride down was gentle and, without a doubt, the best part of the experience. There was no wind on the DZ and it was an easy landing. Breathing hard from the excitement, I was ecstatic—as were we all!
As we folded up our chutes and headed to the assembly point, the guys exchanged comments on the wonder of it all, but not one admitted—during those moments of self-congratulation and, dare I say, swagger—that he had been scared shitless! Notwithstanding, it was in moments like those that pride gushed in who we were and what we might accomplish together. It was especially felt on our daily runs, during the cadence call, with a collective roar: Air-BORNE! We were brothers. It felt good. It was a standard of togetherness that I never—well, rarely—saw replicated later in society but wished often that we could bottle it—the loyalty, the mutual regard regardless of background, the camaraderie, the brotherhood.
One down. We waited three weeks for the next jumps, and they just did them all at once: two on March 28th and the final two the next day, on March 29th. We would never have them spaced so closely together afterward. But we were official. Shortly thereafter we proudly accepted our airborne wings. The next 11 jumps in my brief airborne career were very exciting—how could they not be? In mass jumps, collisions could occur: one trooper had to spread eagle to keep from flying into my lines; another (involuntarily) landed on top of my chute, as I yelled up to him, “Not a good idea, buddy!” and he clambered off so his chute could re-deploy; and I had a near collision myself but was able to pull hard on my lines to slip by another trooper’s chute. Prop blasts spun me upside down several times. My air was stolen once by a guy who came in under me fairly close to landing, causing my chute to collapse and me to fall the last 25–30 feet, jarring the hell out of me, but nothing was broken thanks to that physical training our commanders insisted on.
Once, on a night jump, we literally could not see anything, and the opening shock produced a riser burn on my face; but the hard part was trying to gauge where the ground was for a landing; I went into my PLF at least five times before actually hitting the ground. And several times on landing, the wind was way up and just re-inflated our chutes and dragged us some 50-75 yards before we could right ourselves. I could hear hilarious laughter and cursing all around me, one friend later saying, “They needed a traffic cop out there to direct us!” Every paratrooper has stories with variations on these themes.
But my seventh jump, on May 16, 1955, was the jump to end all jumps—and it nearly did. One of the most memorable events of my life. I was number four on the starboard stick. Claggett reserved the number one spot for himself, which was okay with me! Believe it or not, as I was picking up my pre-packed chute (paratroopers had long since stopped packing their own; a special unit did that), I had a twinge that almost said, no, not that one. But I recovered quickly and chalked it up to pre-jump jitters. I should have listened. We were to jump from 1000 feet that day. Again, the C-119 was our aircraft. The jumpmaster barked the usual commands as we approached the Los Baños (Philippines) Drop Zone. We stood, hooked up, checked equipment and shuffled forward, almost touching one another, waiting for the red light next to the open door to turn green, which was the pilot’s signal to the jumpmaster that we had arrived at the DZ.
I could see the green light flash and heard the jumpmaster’s “Go!” as the pandemonium began; the rush to the door was filled with yelling and cussing (as I had found out later when I was back in the ranks and not the first one out); everyone was eager to get out the door (for some inexplicable reason!), and I just followed along, minus the screaming. At the number four position, it was only a matter of a few seconds before my turn came. I had learned, in those terrible moments, to shut down all thinking and just charge out the door, literally throwing caution to the winds. I tumbled in the gale but kept a tight body position as I began my count—hup-thousand on down to four thousand! I looked up to check my canopy, and found to my shocking surprise that the lines were furled up, kind of like a squid, with a bit of a puff at the very top of the canopy. I was hurtling down and was in a straight up-and-down position. I looked down and saw the ground just whooshing up at me, and decided not to do that again.
I was operating on pure adrenalin, my training kicked-in to automatic, I grasped the D-Ring on my reserve chute strapped on my front, and, instinctively knowing that this was not a time to think things over, pulled hard. I had never had occasion to resort to my reserve chute before, but we were told to feed it out to the wind, and I started to do that. Parachutes can steal air from each other, and, even though the main wasn’t deployed, it was preventing my reserve’s ability to deploy. So I decided instantaneously to maximize the chances of the main to deploy over the reserve chute, and began to haul in the reserve chute. I had done everything that I knew to do and was on the verge of losing hope when, all of a sudden, the main chute popped and I was on the ground hard within another second or two in a clump of trees, off the DZ.
Someone came running up to me and breathlessly asked, “Do you know where your chute opened?” You can’t gauge heights when you’re falling, so, full of optimism over my gift of life, I guessed, saying, “I don’t know—maybe 300 feet up?” And he said, “See the top of that tree? That’s where your chute opened!” The tree was maybe 60 to 75 feet tall. I could hardly believe it! They used to tell us that if you threw a sack of potatoes the weight of an average man out of an airplane 1,000 feet up it would land in about eight seconds. Everything I’ve described happened in rapid succession, and I estimate that the time it took me to reach the ground from the moment I exited the aircraft was no more than 10 to 12 seconds.
I began a conversation with God as I walked back to the assembly point. We got to know each other a lot better from then on. I saw Bill and he said he saw someone whistling by him on the way down, assuming the worst, not knowing it was me. The commanding officer seemed to be more concerned about the reasons for the malfunctioning parachute than about my wellbeing, but finally came over and asked if I was okay. Whenever a “bad” jump happens, they try to get you back up as soon as possible to ward off the evil spirits, so the CO said something to that effect to one of the ranking noncoms in our unit to ensure that I would have another jump soon. We usually jumped every month or so, sometimes two. I was up the following week, and that one went smoothly, as these things go. I said nothing to my family about all of this until after I was discharged from the service.
As it happened, May 16 was Bill’s birthday, so we began celebrating that date as the birthday for both of us. Years later I used to observe two birthdays during the course of a year, but Dorian insisted that I had to choose just one. So I chose my re-birth of May 16. Besides, it made me 23 years younger than my original birthday, and that’s the one we observe to this day.
That parachute jump had a profound effect on my life, and on my view of life as a precious estate. It also marked the beginning of a spiritual journey for me that has deepened and enriched my life beyond measure. I could have exited my life at that time. But it was given back to me. I like to think that there was a reason, and, because of it, that maybe I should hold myself to a high standard—not a high-er standard. I believe we all should hold ourselves to a high standard, but everyone is in charge of his or her own commitment and journey to reach that higher plane.
I have chosen to take my journey quite seriously, and to use this gift of life, as my lights might allow, in service to others. The injunction to “repair the world” took on a whole new dimension for me, and I saw it not only as a fundamental Judaic teaching, but as a universal teaching that is equally reflected in all the great religions of the world. We don’t have to fight with one another over whose religion says it best. I believe we are all endowed with a spark of the Divine and that our true selves will live on beyond this “mortal coil.” But we each have a responsibility to make this life a good one for everyone, and we can do that by first recognizing that we are all part of one human family—with Divine roots.
How could this not influence my political view of the world? Interestingly, in recent years when I have tried to teach democracy to Muslims in the Middle East, I always sought to invoke the teachings of Muhammad who—wisely—enjoins his followers to respect the worth of the other person. It follows, I maintain, that such mutual respect is the beginning of problem-solving without resort to violence, and, as the circle of this practice widens, a more peaceful world is thereby given a chance to unfold. This mutual respect is often expressed as love, or kindness, or good will. They all work. And while progress has been made, I needn’t list the proofs that we still have a long way to go. For all we know, perhaps the history of this planet—whether as a place of good will or a destroyed wasteland—will be measured by the success, or lack thereof, of our aggregated individual journeys to make it a better place. As I see it, each of us thus bears some responsibility for our shared destiny, and—though it’s not for me to say—perhaps some accountability, too.
Meanwhile, as we settled back to earth, the friendship between Bill Claggett and me deepened. In August, 1955, we were transferred en masse to the storied 82nd Airborne Division at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina, where we continued our airborne training on the Drop Zones of Normandy, Salerno, and Holland. I was assigned to the Headquarters Detachment of division headquarters, instead of a line unit, where I assume the personnel folks thought my college education could be most effectively used. And there I remained until my tour ended a year later.
Claggett was assigned to another unit, but we maintained our close friendship and saw one another frequently. We mused about the prospect of international travel together after our service tours were over. We became serious about it, and began speculating about where we might go. I took it upon myself to begin writing embassies to find out about visa requirements. That brought me into contact, unbeknownst to me at the time, with the Counter-Intelligence Corps.
We were in the midst of the Cold War with the Soviet Union at the time, and there was great uncertainty about the future. Senator Joseph McCarthy began stirring up the people with incendiary accusations, without proof, about Communist affiliations. I sat in on one of McCarthy’s hearing during my Colgate semester in Washington, and he was indeed a bully. While McCarthy was condemned by the Senate on December 2, 1954, for “conduct that tended to bring the Senate into dishonor and disrepute,” the social context in the country was nevertheless one of great anxiety.
Into that milieu, I blithely and naively sent a letter to the Soviet Embassy in Washington—along with a dozen or two similar letters to other embassies—seeking information on travel to and within the Soviet Union and what visa requirements a traveler might be expected to meet. I saved everything—copies and responses—neatly clipped in a file that I kept in the bottom drawer of my desk in my office. Well, that letter of inquiry to the Soviet Embassy precipitated a wide-ranging espionage investigation into me. I didn’t find out about it until just before my discharge, when my good friend and barracks bunk neighbor, Johnny Byrd, said to me, “Jack, I think I can tell you now that your case has been closed.”

Dedication
A
S I COMPLETE this retrospective of my adventure through life, and reflect on how deeply thankful I am for the opportunity to have experienced so many of its dimensions and to have learned so much, I have carefully considered whether there was any one human being whose contribution was so primal that it made everything possible for me. There is, in fact, one such person who deeply touched my life, or, I should say, made my life possible. That person is my maternal grandfather, Abraham Goruch. He was a highly respected family leader, to be sure, though he otherwise walked humbly through his life. But one fateful day in 1911, on his inhospitable home soil of Russia, he performed an extraordinary act of personal bravery in the face of a marauding Cossack band that threatened both him and the lives of his family. As recounted in the pages that follow, he instinctively, courageously, and selflessly rose to confront that fearful and imminent danger and, at great risk to himself, succeeded in protecting them from harm. In so doing, my grandfather changed the lives of his family and its descendants forever. That included my mother, then 10 years old, and, in turn, me. It is not that his brave act changed the quality of my life; it made my life possible. So in dedicating this book to him, I proudly and gratefully honor my grandfather who, in the most profound way, gave me both the gift of life itself and the inspiration to endeavor without surcease to put it to some useful purpose.
Acknowledgments
G
RATITUDE WITH A FULL HEART is first extended to my wife, Dorian, whose love, encouragement, and forbearance during the writing of this memoir never faltered. And to my talented nephew, Dean Schramm, a Hollywood literary agent and producer, learned in the writing and publishing arts, I shall always be grateful for wise counsel and unwavering encouragement. Paul Edwards, my Kansas City campaign manager and later, an author with his wife Sarah of 17 books, was enormously helpful with suggestions, edits, and contacts. I extend special thanks, also, to my publishers at New Insights Press, especially to managing editor Rick Benzel for his many editing improvements and for leading me through the publishing maze, and to art director Susan Shankin for her brilliant cover design and book layout. I am blessed with a large group of friends, many talented writers themselves, who, with care not to hurt my feelings too much, offered thoughtful and very helpful edits to the manuscript. I list them here (alphabetically) with heartfelt gratitude: Hilary Claggett, Wynne Cougill, Cliff Johnson (my Middle East motorcycle partner), Sheldon Novick (a biographer of note), Lonnie Shalton, Judith Slaughter, and Mary Allen Wilkes. And there were so many others, beloved family as well as friends around the world, who encouraged me to write it all down. They include a unique group of Missouri legislative friends, many named in the book, who, during our tenure, took the name, ROSD—or Royal Order of Shit Disturbers, which says it all. We still meet annually. The camaraderie is delicious.
Prologue
A
WORD ABOUT HOW this book came to be: As I moved through the winter of my professional life, I began to think that I might have at least one book in me. But I wasn’t thinking about any kind of memoir at all. I liked public policy and was kind of wonky about it; in fact, as I thought about a book, I thought that maybe I could organize one around a series of essays on the great issues of the day. The topics that came to mind included climate change, Israel-Palestine, the Electoral College, immigration reform, wherefore the United Nations, unbundling Islamic teachings, and the like. Plenty of stuff out there that excites peoples’ curiosity. But that’s as far as I got. I couldn’t get the project under way because I kept saying to myself, “Who cares what I think about these issues? There are lots of scholarly treatises about them.”
Word got around to my friends and colleagues about my writing project, and, assuming it was a memoir, they peppered me with questions about it. “Will you talk about your assignments to Iraq and living in Saddam’s palace and getting bitten by rats?” Or, “Will you reveal that your first marriage was in Tangier, Morocco after a shipboard romance?” Or, “Can you work in why those Pennsylvania legislative leaders complained about you to the White House?” Or, “You won’t omit that paratroop outing when your ‘chute finally decided to open at tree-top level?” Or, “Please tell everyone about how your Missouri legislative cabal, your Royal Order of Shit Disturbers, your ROSD—how they got that name!” Or, “I loved your motorcycle adventure from Baghdad through the Middle East; it will be great to finally get the whole story.” Or, “Tell us, are we still waiting, or did China ever implement your environmental recommendations?” Or, “It will be sad but memorable to recall that election night in ’72 when we waited for the returns to come in on your lieutenant governor’s race!” And on and on it went. My friends were all very excited to read about my political episodes, consulting on four continents, and personal adventures. Their enthusiasm was marvelous, and they assumed I would definitely write about my own life. But—again—that’s not where my head was. I had my doubts. Who, besides family and friends, would be interested?
Informal remarks on my life in governance at the 50th Reunion of our Washington University Law School class
Unless, I thought one day, I could use my experiences to impart something useful to a general audience, but especially those interested in politics and perhaps having a lengthy career, as mine has been, in government. Then, as I was pondering that question, I had something of an epiphany. It was staring me right in the face. My whole life had been devoted to governance in one form or another, whether executing it as an elected and appointed official or as a consultant in so many places around the world—if I could make governance my central theme, maybe it would work. And so the plan for this book began to take shape.
I could talk about my bumpy political journey and the governance insights I gleaned from my experiences at the state, federal, and international levels—and perhaps, I speculated, others would benefit from those insights as well. My life experience, as I stopped to think about it, was very broad and the stories at each level were rich in political intrigue, power trips, and, especially as to the international work, an insider’s look into what was happening behind the headlines. I could sketch out my early years and what forces formed my thoughts about government and contributing to better the world.
Though my school friends and I considered ourselves as American as apple pie, we were all first generation Americans, and we saw this country through the eyes of our ever-grateful parents and their friends. The influences were subtle but quite real, as were others in those formative years. When I went away to college, and later, I began to see differences in my peers—in our upbringing, our values, and our points of view about the world. For example, I never heard a negative word about President Franklin Roosevelt until I was a sophomore in college! He was practically worshipped by the adults in my early life. Those early years were when my values took shape—and my naiveté and sensitivities were challenged—and they became key to the directions I took in my later professional life. I had an adventure streak a mile wide and a curiosity about the unknown, what life was about beyond my neighborhood and schools. I explored, reached out and touched things I had experienced only in books. My military experience and my worldwide travel—I didn’t want to do what, or go where, everybody else did—taught me a great deal about self-reliance, experimentation . . . and the value of seeking. It was important that I talk about those things in my book as well; they contributed to how I got to be who I am, and why I think as I do. And they became governance values every bit as much as the experiences I had in my neighborhood growing up and during my education. I like to think of it all as context.
So, finally, I had a formula for a book. I was to be a vehicle—constructed uniquely from many parts, to be sure—to provide glimpses into how government worked at many different levels. I had to explain it through the only lens I knew—me. But it wasn’t to be just about me and all of my ego—but what I learned about governance—a distinction very important to me.
Moreover, I didn’t want it to be a textbook, for heaven’s sake. The glimpses and the lessons were simply to accompany my trip through life. They were not to be served up on a silver platter, but to be ingested in a natural flow with each course of my life’s various passages. I was blown off course several times—as have we all.
For me, each new course proved to be not only useful but purposeful. I think I have been fortunate in that regard, though I do believe that it is important that we not give up on trying to make our lives count for something in the larger scheme of things. If that comes through in this book, I would be proud to be the messenger, and maybe that’s lesson enough. I hope you will bear with me as I move through some of the substantive issues I encountered in my journey. I have tried not to be too technical or legalistic about those things, but I wanted to serve up some of the flavor of the work I did, both domestically and internationally, and I trust I have found a proper balance and not been too off-putting. I hope that there is something to be learned from the experiences I have had—about governance and other things. But you be the judge.
PART 1
VALUES AND THE FORMATIVE YEARS
ONE
First Generation Life in America
M
Y WORLD BEGAN at 1:45 a.m. on Thursday, January 21, 1932 at the Missouri Baptist Hospital in St. Louis—an Aquarian, as astrology would hold, who would see the world as one closely-related human family and would paint in broad strokes. And because I landed on the cusp of Capricorn, the stars further predicted that I was to be given strength of purpose and the fortitude to move my objectives forward. Both would later prove to be my strongest inner instincts, though, I also found, they were no guarantor of success.
I was the third of four sons, and we were born in couplets. The elder pair, Marvin and Norman (in that order), were born in the 1920s with their names reflecting a more traditional world. Seven years elapsed before I came along, followed 21 months later by brother Paul, our names reflecting perhaps a tilt toward modernity. Marv and Norman, perceived by us in those early years as much older, went off to serve in the armed forces during World War II. Paul and I, closer in age, shared more of life’s experiences. We were first generation Americans. I had no idea that this was a significant demographic until decades later. We were American as apple pie, strongly patriotic—and poor. We were, after all, in the middle of the Great Depression. But that characteristic was common to everyone we knew. My mother’s maiden name was Frieda Sylvia Goruch. Born in 1901, she was second eldest of four daughters and a son, born to Abraham and Rebecca Goruch (or Goruchovsky before it was anglicized). She lived in a shtetl just outside of Kiev in what is now Ukraine, but was then under Russian rule. Jews weren’t allowed to live within the boundaries of Kiev proper. She used to tell us that the floor of their home was bare earth. Everyone had a trade in the shtetls of the time, and my maternal grandfather (born in 1875) made his living as a tailor.
Pogroms were deadly and feared by the shtetl populations of Eastern Europe during those terrible years, particularly from 1880 through 1914 when anti-Semitism raged throughout the Russian Empire. It seemed that much of the blame for all the troubles of society was laid at the feet of the already ostracized Jews, and it would only get worse unless they found a way out of there. Ukrainian Russia, where my family lived, was somehow a particular hotbed for government-sanctioned pogroms, though the Czar vehemently denied any role on his part.
One fateful day in 1911 my mother’s settlement was attacked by marauding Russian Cossacks on horseback, one swooping in to assault my grandfather, then 33, and his family. Putting his family behind him, my grandfather ran forward to intercept the rider and threw him from his horse. Since resistance was not tolerated, my grandfather had to leave his family following the altercation and flee for his life! With the parting words, “I will get you out!” he made his way to Hamburg where he hid in a lifeboat on an ocean liner bound for New Orleans. Once there, he slipped off the ship and managed to follow the Mississippi River north up to St. Louis where other immigrants he knew had settled, including (helpfully) his father, who had peacefully, to use the word loosely, emigrated there in January 1909.
There were, of course, many other European immigrant groups in that era who were escaping from very difficult circumstances, but few who feared daily for their very safety as did the Jews of the time. In the case of my grandfather, it’s accurate to say that he was one of America’s early undocumented aliens. The memory of his story is seared into my conscience and unceasingly reminds me of my own personal commitment to supporting a proper solution to a significant item of America’s unfinished business—the plight of America’s current crop of undocumented aliens. It should be easily understood that the punishing experience of the Jewish Diaspora over two millennia has forged into the DNA of successive generations of Jews, down to the present one, a sensitivity to the plight of the downtrodden and a yearning for a just society. As events will bear out in this personal account, it is certainly there in mine, as imperfect in its expression as my fettered humanity has allowed. But it is unmistakably there. What America, cloaked in an ever struggling exceptionalism, so importantly adds to the mix is a unique collection of governance values—an exciting infusion of profound democratic community—that offers a realistic hope of perfecting such a society in the fullness of time.
In the old immigrant neighborhoods of St. Louis, my grandfather, resolutely trying to find his way, found an abandoned storefront on 6th Street which, as luck would have it, contained a scrapped sign in the back that read, “Buck the Tailor.” So, with that welcoming token bestowed no doubt by his guardian angels (whose work was pretty good so far), my brave and embattled grandfather became Buck the Tailor! He saved his nickels and dimes for two years at the trade he knew, and then sent for his family who had been holding their own with the help of friends and extended family on the outskirts of Kiev.
My grandmother’s family, and her sister’s family as well, eleven strong (six Goruchovsky’s and five Kranitzky’s) arrived in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on January 13, 1913. The Canadian Pacific Railroad then ushered them down to Detroit where they were admitted into the United States, finally, feeling absolutely incredulous over what was happening in their lives. Immigration officials, as they did with so many of the European unpronounceables, shortened my grandmother’s name from Goruchovsky to Goruch and her sister’s name from Kranitzky to Crane. They then traveled overland to St. Louis—my mother was 12—where they had a joyous reunion with my grandfather who, then, impatiently escorted them to his tailor shop where they would live for a time. It had a wooden floor! Happily re-unified, the family continued its struggle for survival, but at least in freedom in this new world of theirs—no small consideration if one stops to think about it, and, as I came to believe, one that we take for granted at our peril.
Many decades later, I had a consulting assignment in Kiev. Our threesome hailed a taxi and went to visit the Babi Yar Memorial, a ravine on the outskirts of the city. It was there that the Nazis, in their war against the Soviet Union, rounded up all the Jews in the Kiev region for what they said was transportation to another holding area. Then they were told to dig further into the ravine. Over the next two days, September 29th and 30th 1941, in a ruthless operation, Nazi Sonderkommandos murdered all 33,771 Jews who were gathered there—men, women, and children. It was one of the largest single massacres in the history of the Holocaust. Other later victims at the site included thousands of Soviet POWs, communists, Gypsies, Ukrainian nationalists, and civilian hostages. Estimates are that 100,000 to 150,000 lives were taken in that ravine.
I stood there looking at it, next to the memorial, in utter disbelief, trying to conjure up the abject terror that had been experienced there and which has become a bitter lesson in the failures of humanity. I was gripped by a realization, known casually as just family history before, but shockingly thrust into my consciousness in that moment: My mother and her family would have been totally wiped out in 1941 in that ravine had my grandfather not escaped himself and sent for them 28 years earlier. Maybe my father’s family as well. We knew the stories, but standing there right in the middle of the reality of it all was overwhelming. Why do some live and some die? It reinforced my deeply felt curiosity about such bewildering issues which had plagued me for years . . . and still do.
My father, Benjamin Jacob Schramm, was born in 1899 in Volhynia Gaberna, located maybe 175 miles west of Kiev in the northwest sector of present-day Ukraine. In alternating periods of time a part of Poland, Prussia, Austria, or Russia, it belonged to the Russian Empire when my father came onto the scene.
Second eldest of four children, my father was the only boy. The anglicized names of his parents were Frank and Ida Schramm. My paternal grandfather was born about 1870 and was a Talmud teacher and scholar. Interestingly, the name Schramm is a fairly common German name. German emigration to Volhynia Gaberna, mostly from Poland but also from some German provinces, grew to a population estimated at some 200,000 by the turn of the century. So somewhere down the line, my father’s forbears took on the same name of their Christian German neighbors—probably their landowners, in much the same way, I would guess, an African American bore the name of his ancestors’ slave owners. But conditions of the Volhynian Germans began to deteriorate in the late 19th century and thousand began to emigrate to both the United States and Canada.
My paternal grandfather, like so many of his Volhynian German neighbors, took his family and emigrated to America in 1905, and made their way to St. Louis also. My father was just six. Once in St. Louis, my grandparents on both sides, still unknown to one another, settled into life—the Goruches (my grandfather finally succumbed to the practicalities of this shortened version) on Carr Street and the Schramms in a nearby neighborhood—in what is now downtown St. Louis. This is the area where most of the Eastern European immigrants gathered. Some called it a Jewish ghetto, not unlike the living habits that had been forced upon them for centuries in the shtetls of the Eastern European diaspora. It was a mutual protection and comfort thing.
My father was a good student, especially in math, and made it through the eighth grade. My mother went through the fifth grade, and left school to help out at home. A love of music, and an aptitude for its expression led my father to violin lessons. He developed a real flair for technique but his passion was especially evident as he pursed his lips and leaned forward, his body and bow arm in rhythmic synchronicity, surging from dulcet to brio on both instrument and brow, as he transited the emotional phrasing in a sweeping melody of Tchaikovsky or Beethoven. My father was in charge and ecstatic when he was doing his music—his thing. It showed on his face. It was good to see, as he didn’t have that kind of happiness—in a protracted sense—as the years wore on.
The early years were better and more promising. It was inevitable that my father would become a professional musician—and an accomplished one. Professional opportunities began to come, and he found himself organizing and leading small groups of musicians for weddings and other functions.
As he broke into his twenties, buoyed by his music and feeling lighthearted, he was emboldened to turn to matters of the heart. He met Frieda Goruch, a beautiful young girl with a pug nose and regular Slavic-like features. She agreed to accompany him on some of his playing engagements, sitting off to the side and proudly watching her boyfriend entertain all those strangers. It was kind of exciting for them both. Unable to deny their love for each other, they married in 1920—he was 21 and she 19. Thus began the tumultuous life of Ben and Frieda Schramm.
Marvin arrived in 1922 and Norman in 1924. The Roaring 20’s was a time of opportunity for musicians, perhaps the most successful time of my father’s life, as he was engaged to play dinner music at the (still) fashionable Chase Hotel. A large black sign with silver glitter letters reading “Ben Schramm and his Orchestra” hung over the stage—and he kept that sign for all the ensuing decades of his life in a closet wherever he lived.
In 1927, and feeling ready, my parents emigrated from the City of St. Louis to the County of St. Louis (two different jurisdictions). They wanted to be where the rest of the Jewish community was moving—into the adjoining suburb of University City (so named because it abutted Washington University in St. Louis and many of its streets were named for universities: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, Tulane, Colgate, Dartmouth, the more prominent ones). The family lived in three apartments over the next nine years. The stock market crashed in 1929 and the depression had engulfed everyone.
My father’s music business crashed, too. He tried to open up a dry cleaning business, but he refused to pay protection to the mob—so they threw a bomb through his window and that ended that. My mother thought she had to do something to earn some money, so she bought some hosiery and underwear at discount prices and then sold them to the employees at several hotels who agreed to the purchases if they could pay for them a little each week. So she marked up the articles and sold them at a profit. She began regular collections for these sales. And her business grew to include furniture and appliances and a retail store owner backed her with merchandise.
Her customers were all in the black community, and this kind of arrangement was the only way they could afford those necessities. She was trailblazing, one could argue, the credit card economy we have today. She didn’t know it, but she also had started the feminist movement.
As my mother was getting underway in her business, we moved to our fourth apartment in 1936. I was four. All of these apartments were located in an area called the Delmar Loop, so named because it was the streetcar turnaround for the westernmost reach of the then ‘mass transit’ system of St. Louis. Our new apartment was a third floor walkup at 6319 Delmar Boulevard, right on the main drag. The Loop was U. City’s business district and stretched for about eight blocks beyond the city line.
At the far end of the business district was Delmar-Harvard Grade School (at the corner of Delmar and Harvard Avenue), where brother Paul and I attended grade school. My political career started in kindergarten where my teachers (Miss Olmstead and Miss Iseley—I’ll never forget them) appointed me the fire chief of a red fire wagon that we had built. I remember being surprised. From humble beginnings and all that . . . .
Times were still tough for everyone in the Loop. FDR and the federal government created the Works Progress Administration (or WPA as it was popularly known) in 1935 to preserve the skills and self-respect of the working people of America. It lasted until 1943. They did everything—from infrastructure to the arts. It included the creation of the WPA symphony orchestra that played every week in University City’s Heman Park. My father signed up as a violinist, as did many of his musician friends. We frequently went to listen to the orchestra on a summer evening. My father earned about $90.00 a month, which helped with the rent, while my mother earned the grocery money.
We lived in that Delmar apartment all the way through my first year of law school. It was home. Early on, my mother’s credit business attracted other entrants—all men. About a dozen of them banded together, along with my mother (the only woman), to pool their purchasing power so that they could buy their merchandise at favorable prices. Mom held her own with the men—and her boys were proud of her, though we didn’t quite realize how extraordinary she was. The family members—all of us—just forged ahead with our lives. And enjoyed the dinners she cooked for us every evening, which we just took for granted.
My father never seemed to be able to get a toehold in business, and tried several ventures into the 1940’s. He was an artist, not a businessman, and seemed very unhappy most of the time. He was able to join several community orchestras, the first in University City and the second in Kirkwood (another suburb), and I truly think those were lifesavers for him.
One day when I was about 10, I got a look at life in the raw. My mother hired one of her customers, Margaret, to clean the house once a week to pick up the slack for her. Margaret was like one of the family. On a warm sunny day, Margaret asked if I would like a root beer—a real treat because I knew it meant going down the street to visit Blondie & Dick’s Root Beer Stand, an outdoor arrangement vividly painted in orange and black, and extremely popular in the Loop. We were seated at the bar and there were no other customers. Margaret paid for a large mug and I chugged most of it down but couldn’t finish it, so I passed it over to Margaret and asked her to finish it for me. She smiled, put the mug to her lips, and no sooner had she done that, when Blondie appeared—she startled me—and snatched the mug right out of Margaret’s hands, saying, “Sorry!”
I was only a little guy, but I was dumbstruck! I knew what had happened but could hardly believe it. Margaret was denied service by Blondie because, and only because, she was black (“African American” wasn’t in vogue yet). Margaret was hurt. I could tell it, but she held onto her dignity. I hurt, too, for Margaret, and was so very embarrassed. It just wasn’t right, I remembered thinking. We walked home in silence, but that scene remained with me throughout my life, and has informed my conscience on matters of race whenever it was in my power to do something about it. I didn’t yet know what politics was about but I believe we all face character-building moments, as this one was for me, and we either experience some kind of propulsion within us that directs us to want to make change, or we don’t. Whoever is in charge of imprinting consciences found an easy mark in me.
Little by little I began to develop a notion about how people should treat one another. I was a bit shy and serious—but proud. Not flashy or show-offy proud. But I wanted to be upstanding and didn’t want to be criticized for not doing the right thing. I then had a personal experience as a youngster that challenged my self-righteousness, if I can call it that. Every Jewish kid in my generation experienced prejudice at one time or another. Every one.
On one occasion, I was forced into a physical fight—the only one I ever had. I was only about 11. About five neighbor kids, including my brother Paul and me, went over to have some fun at an abandoned construction site nearby. We weren’t there five minutes when five older boys suddenly appeared; they were from nearby Christ the King parochial school, who were notorious for seeking out “Jew-boy Christ-killers” and beating them up. They let it be known that we were their targets. Our little group fled wildly down the hill—except me. I was too proud to run, though I don’t know what came over me. I just stood there frozen to the ground. Brother Paul was frantically calling to me to run.
The bullies selected one of their number to do the honors. Meanwhile, Paul and the other kids ran home and screamed at my brother Norman (who was 17 or 18) ‘to come rescue Jack who was getting beaten up.’ Norm rushed back with the other kids, and we were still grappling. But Norman was the equalizer and, for the sake of everyone’s pride, I guess it was, wisely asked if we wanted to fight it out, and we both nodded yes, almost automatically. To tell the truth, I wasn’t so sure. But, knowing it would now be a fair fight, and the others wouldn’t pile on, I was energized and became very aggressive, slugging the guy. After a bit, I yelled, “Tell me when you’ve had enough!” And he finally did. The bullies made a fast exit, and I remember the triumphant walk home, Norman, with his arm around my shoulder, beaming down at his little brother.
The ferocity of anti-Semitism has moderated with the passing of each generation—from the shtetls and Holocaust of my grandparents’ and parents’ time, to the present where it is certainly the case that our children have been less exposed to this mindless hatred. But it’s still out there, perhaps worse in the subtler (and sometimes not so subtle) expressions of racial bias experienced by African Americans. And today the LGBT community and Latinos are experiencing some of the same kinds of senseless hatred that stands in the way of love and acceptance of our fellow human beings. Although, over time, we assuredly have done better, we should hope that the trajectory improves.
So, if one is born into a cauldron of “them” and “us,” attitudes are shaped. Certainly mine were shaped—as one of “them”—by personally witnessing and experiencing, even at a tender age, the callousness of hatred, the damage it inflicts, and the sorrow it leaves behind. I cannot square it with any concept of cosmic morality that I have encountered. Others may be born into, and come to identify with a culture of “us vs. them.” It must be very difficult to wrest one’s mind from this kind of negativity and the divisiveness that those influences tend to weave into one’s DNA. The struggle between these two forces has been played out in America since our beginnings as we try to “form a more perfect union.” I happen to believe that the expansion of personal liberties will continue, but those of like mind will need to persevere to make it happen.
Nowadays the “other side,” to put it gently, is more sophisticated in its discrimination. It couches its lack of concern for “them” in the polemics of such phantoms as fear of takeover (reflected in restrictive immigration policy and absence of gun control), fear of abuse (reflected in hobbled voting rights ), Biblical injunction (reflected in restraints on LGBT rights, women’s rights), big government intrusiveness (reflected in seeking an unshackling from economic, environmental, and all manner of regulation), and constitutional exhortation (using the Constitution to restrict rather than enlarge rights—such as using the 10th Amendment ‘powers reserved to the states’ clause to de-fang Federal jurisdiction or the 14th Amendment ‘due process’ clause to undo abortion rights).
TWO
Political Nascence: The Fledgling Years
S
EVERAL YEARS AGO when I joined my classmates in St. Louis for the 50th reunion of our graduation from the Washington University School of Law, we were asked to explain the circumstances surrounding our decision to study law and what our legal careers were all about. When my turn came, I said I had wanted to become a lawyer since the age of 12, but that my principal motivation was not so much to practice but rather to make law. I didn’t know where that came from, I joked, unless I had been in the Roman Senate in a previous life. The way politics gripped my life throughout my school years, and ineluctably directed me toward politics later, has made me wonder where in the world that inner drive and motivation truly came from.
Even in my neighborhood growing up, and still in grade school, I seemed to have had a penchant for organizing things. It wasn’t anything special, and I didn’t attach any significance to it. I suggested stuff and the kids just followed along. For example, I organized a “Bike Patrol,” looking for I don’t know what, evil-doers, I suppose. Also an “army” of 12 young stalwarts—and I was the general, of course. This was during World War II and we even did hikes as training maneuvers and “played guns.” The NRA would have been proud! Probably the most fun was the cork ball league I organized where St. Louis kids (it’s the only place it’s played) learned to hit lightning fast balls and curves, thrown with a tennis ball, with a sawed-off broomstick. And that morphed into a fast pitch baseball team that I organized to play against other neighborhood teams, all before we were in high school. We used to create our own amusements as there were no professional youth organizers or clubs in the 1940s.
My 7th to 9th grade happened at Ward Junior High School. As we reached the end of the 8th grade and the election of next year’s student council president loomed, I found myself a candidate, at the behest of some friends. It was 1945 and the world was consumed by the prospect of World War II coming to an end. The surrender of Germany and Japan (the latter prompted by the use of atomic weapons) was only a few months off. So in my speech to the student body, I spoke of the scourge of war and how we had to be steadfast in the face of its challenges. Never mind what I would do for the school, if elected. I was only 13, had just been bar mitzvahed a few months earlier and obviously had taken the Hebrew injunction of Tikun Olam (Repair the World) perhaps too seriously, for this election anyway. But so it would be for the rest of my life. Well, I won the election (my first), and I was teasingly reminded of that speech by classmates as many as 30 years later! In this, I learned that if you can’t do relevance, memorable is good!
The next phase of my busy life took place at University City Senior High School. From ages 15 through 17, everything was new and wonderful, and included sports, fraternities, dating, and school politics, too. Sports, especially, consumed me. I was good at baseball and lettered in all three of my high school years. I also played American Legion baseball and in summer industrial leagues—with and against players who went to the major leagues.
Then there were clubs, the school newspaper, and, of course, the student council. My home room class elected me to the student council in the 10th grade. I worked hard in my studies and became a self-starter as I knew help from home was unlikely. Academically, I was above average and finally made the honor roll in my last couple of semesters. Grades were truly earned in those days the hard way.
The end of the 11th grade came and, with it, campaign time for the office of student body president for our senior year. Or, to be more precise, for the first half of our senior year; the school administration thought it best to share this school honor between two students, one for each semester. Again, friends urged me to run. I would never have run without their encouragement, as my shy self would have thought it too presumptuous to run otherwise. Election day came and we gave our speeches. I don’t remember what I said, but I won (or maybe my campaign manager, Chuck Walker, won; he gave a very entertaining speech). So, on this one, I learned that if you can’t do substance, entertainment is good!
Senior year came, and it was an exciting one. Presiding over the student council and its work, chair of the Junior-Senior Prom Committee, I was also selected (I don’t remember how) to be Mayor of University City for a Day. I continued to take everything seriously. One day, Miss Briscoe, our student council faculty sponsor, gently nudged me not to overdo it by saying, “Jack, I heard one girl say that she would love it if you would just smile!” Notwithstanding, in the final tallies for senior class ‘most this and that,’ Dick Dutton, student body president in the second semester, and I tied as “Most Popular Boy.” So maybe it was okay to be serious-minded!
Of course, during senior year, the thoughts of almost all of my classmates turned to college—where would we go? U. City High School had developed a sterling reputation in the university community as among the best high schools in St. Louis County—and there were dozens. About 90% of its graduates went on to college. Everyone was expected to. Most of us were first generation Americans and “People of the Book,” and we knew that education was a path to the American dream. It was 1949. The Great Depression and World War II both had ended, and I instinctively felt that education would help me accomplish things that were beginning to stir deeply within me. For those of us living in the Delmar Loop especially, we couldn’t wait to get started.
Since Princeton and Harvard took our academic stars, it was hard for me not to dream, too, about going to an Eastern college. My family certainly could not afford it. So while I was awaiting some celestial guidance, the admissions dean from Colgate University in Hamilton, New York decided to visit our high school for the first time, based on our reputation. I attended—and was hooked by pictures of the beautiful campus in a small town, an all-male student body of only 1,300, the core curriculum of philosophy and religion, public affairs, the study of an alternative culture, but mostly by the prospect of joining the Washington Study Group for a semester of studying the federal government right there in its offices. Though it was late in the season, I sent for an application and, shortly thereafter, was contacted by Tom DePew, Colgate’s college advisor for St. Louis. We hit it off famously. A successful businessman, Tom always wanted to help deserving people, often saying to me throughout the course of a lifelong friendship, “We’ve got to help them, Jack!” I didn’t realize at the time that I was one of his early projects. He proved to be one of the most decent people I have ever known.
I needed a scholarship and Tom went to bat for me to be sure I received one. What I didn’t know until well after I had graduated was that I had applied too late for financial aid for my freshman year, and that Tom had arranged with the school to pay for my freshman year himself. He really wanted me to go to Colgate! (I have since established a scholarship at Colgate as a way of repaying Tom’s poignant and indelible kindness.) My record after my first year persuaded Colgate, going forward, to cover my annual tuition and provide work in the library and dining facilities to defray room and board. This amounted to two-thirds of the cost of attending, or $1,600.00 per year. My parents footed the remaining third, or $800.00. How things have changed, as fellow parents will attest!
My freshman year at Colgate was exciting. I made lots of friends, pledged Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, one of the more popular ones, and in contravention of its ‘only for Christians’ clause. Again, I was asked to run for freshman class president by friends. As I recall, my speech was about how all of us should receive invitations to the fraternities, as Princeton had done for its eating clubs, because those who were left out (about 15% of the class) truly missed an important social dimension offered by the college. The idea was that if one was good enough to be admitted to the college, he was good enough to be admitted to a fraternity. I won the election. It was then that I knew I would be elected Student Senate president for my senior year. And that’s what happened. It was a strange feeling because it was almost as if I could will my success in these elections. My arrogance would get its comeuppance as time went on, but I was feeling my oats at the time.
My life at Colgate was truly fulfilling. After the freshman class presidency, my fraternity thought I should represent it in the Student Senate, which served only to whet my appetite for more. “Politics” is the word commonly used to describe this kind of activity, but I didn’t use the term. I thought it was much more like a responsibility that one should exercise on behalf of one’s fellows. I was still possessed of that serious and very idealistic turn of mind. After my sophomore year, I won a scholarship from the Experiment in International Living to spend the summer in Morelia, Mexico living with a Mexican family, where I soaked up the culture and language, and broadened my vistas. With courses in International Law and International Organization, I was really getting turned on to the international scene.
During my junior year, my international affairs professor, Dr. Robert Elder, had me appointed to two inter-collegiate positions that would further excite my interest in international policy. The first was as president of the Upstate New York Model United Nations Security Council, comprised of eleven regional universities, which I found intriguing. The second appointment, somewhat more challenging, was as a Main Committee chair at meetings of the Mid-Atlantic Model United Nations General Assembly being held, of all places, at the United Nations Building in New York City. Well, let me tell you—how could a young person not be impressed by conducting even faux UN business in the ECOSOC Chamber itself!
Apparently I was not so bad at doing presiding officer stuff because, at the close of our three day meetings, and in the session where the participants (representing some 60 colleges and universities from the Mid-Atlantic states) were to select the presiding officers for the following year’s session, I was elected to serve as president of the General Assembly. Again, I thought to myself, what is going on here?
Back at Colgate, at the end of my junior year, I was elected student body president and presided over the Student Senate for the first semester of my senior year, but had to turn the gavel over to the vice president (Vail Taylor, a wonderful and deservedly well-respected guy) in the second semester so I could spend that semester in Washington, D.C. with the Washington Study Group. But I had an insight during a philosophy course with Dr. Holmes Hartshorne during that first semester that has remained with me throughout my political life. Dr. Hartshorne explained the American political experience as a national commitment to the autonomous individual. “Well, what does that mean,” he probed?
“Autonomous,” he explained, “derives from two Greek words: ‘autos’ meaning self and ‘nomos’ meaning reason or order. Thus, the self-reasoning or self-ordered individual.”
Then Dr. Hartshorne went on to apply this fundamental concept to our political parties. “The Republicans,” he explained, “emphasize the ‘autos’ or self and are identified with free private enterprise, the values of liberty, and untrammeled, to the extent possible, individual expression. And, for their part, Democrats emphasize the ‘nomos’ and thus are more identified with the reasonable use of government to achieve order and social welfare, emphasizing the equality of individuals in the process. But each carries the seeds and values of the other so that they both can lay claim to a commitment to the autonomous individual. Thus, while Republicans want to reduce regulation and allow Wall Street and the banks to exercise their financial and business creativity for the benefit of all, they would be hesitant to overturn the ‘nomos’ dimension of the equation as represented by Social Security or perhaps other social measures.”
“And the Democrats,” Dr. Hartshorne continued, “although fully committed to the beneficial uses of government as reflected in the ‘nomos’ dimension of this equation, are at the same time committed to the private enterprise system, liberty, and private expression as reflected in the ‘autos,’ perhaps not as ardently as the Republicans, but it is a strongly shared value nonetheless.”
That little insight, as explained by Dr. Hartshorne, was an epiphany for me, and I have carried those words with me throughout my life. They are a great summary of American political life. To me, they mean that we are a nation of shared values. There is more that unites us than divides us. Our differences are a matter of degree. The American political process of transparency and openly debating our differences is designed to allow us to glimpse what the other guy is thinking, to understand it even if we don’t agree with it, and to work to resolve our differences in a peaceful way. The “autonomous individual”—this way of thinking about who we are—is a notion that encapsulates our common worth and has always brought us together in times of national stress. It has kept me sane.
My final semester in Washington, D.C. was a memorable experience! We were ten students, both seniors and juniors, and, as it happened, split down the middle politically—five Republicans and five Democrats. By this time, I knew that my heart was firmly planted on the Democratic side of the aisle. I was able to sharpen my debating skills as we argued all the time, even on the trolley every morning as we headed up to the Capitol from the YMCA where we stayed. That was my first taste of anyone daring to articulate to my face a difference with the way I saw the world! I was comfortable with my views and initially wondered how in the world they—my classmates—could come to such different conclusions. Didn’t we have the same facts and concerns? Well, needless to say, I got quite an education in public policy from my Republican friends. A shot across my naïve bow! What a politically sheltered life I had led!
It was 1953 and Dwight Eisenhower was president, having defeated Adlai Stevenson—such a refined, intelligent fellow, I remember musing—the year before. The semester was eye-opening at so many levels—from a visit in the White House to interview Ike’s press secretary; to a personal interview with Vice President Richard Nixon; to a period of study in the State Department (as a group) and then the Department of Labor (we each had to choose an agency); and, finally, in connection with our study of Congress, its members, and the legislative process, to some three weeks or so as an intern in our own congressman’s office—mine was Representative Tom Curtis, a Republican representing the greater part of St. Louis County. I remember thinking to myself that, someday, I would run for that selfsame seat—and I did some 23 years later, in 1976. Clearly, by this time, I had an undeniable feeling that politics was to be my calling.
Midway through the semester, Dr. Elder and I took a long weekend off to head to Ithaca, N.Y, where I was to assume my responsibilities as President of the Mid-Atlantic Model UN General Assembly. It was to convene at the Cornell Law School. I worked closely, and also shared a dormitory room, with Peter Kenen, a Columbia University student who had been selected to be the Secretary-General. I addressed him as “Peter” and he addressed me as “Your Excellency.” Peter was brilliant and played his role to the hilt. He later received his doctorate at Harvard and, from 1971 through 2004, was the Walker Professor of Economics and International Finance at Princeton and became internationally renowned.
By that time, I had presided over so many student groups that I remember having felt fairly confident and comfortable in managing the flow of debate and occasionally interceding to push along the resolution of an issue. It was a confidence-builder for me and a very satisfying learning experience. When we were packing up to go home following a crowded few days of international problem-solving with wonderfully creative peers—we all wished that we could have had a real go at these issues—Dr. Elder, with whom I had developed a warm relationship, privately whispered to me, “Jack, when you get into this work for real, don’t forget to contact me for consulting purposes!” Given the knowledge imbalance between my professor and me, that he would suggest that I hire him some day—did I really hear what I heard? Though stunned, I was secretly very pleased with what I was doing to warrant Dr. Elder’s confidence.
Dr. Elder and I returned to the program in Washington, concluded our semester’s work in May, and returned to campus to prepare for graduation for those of us who were seniors. I finished my academics with a deep major in political science and two minors—one in philosophy and one in Spanish, both of which I truly relished. I sat with the political science faculty for the departmental honors exam, a daunting exercise! My GPA put me in the top 10% of my class which qualified me for the honors exam with cum laude standing. It could have been magna but for a few C’s in my first couple of semesters while I was learning how to study at the college level. A leak that a faculty friend coaxed out of several political science faculty colleagues revealed to our collective glee that my oral exam was of high honors caliber. But I was delighted, after all was said and done, to graduate Cum Laude with Honors in Political Science from a place like Colgate; I also felt honored to have been admitted to both the junior and senior honorary societies and to have been awarded a George W. Cobb Fellowship for leadership. More than delighted for a boy from the Delmar Loop.
THREE
The Influences of Law School and Military Service
I
WAS ADMITTED TO the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis where I began my first year of legal studies in the Fall of 1953. I lived at home in the Loop, could walk to classes, and had a scholarship loan from the St. Louis Scholarship Foundation. It was good not to be a further financial burden to my parents, who were busy helping my brother Paul through undergraduate school, and later law school, at the University of Missouri-Columbia, some 120 miles away. To have the credential—a law degree—was an enthralling prospect for me.
What a budding lawyer learns from the very beginning is the necessity of finding the core issue of a problem at the very outset of a dispute, how to express it and be right about it. It is necessary in this kind of analysis to put aside any coloration of the issue, whether based in emotion or philosophy, and see it as it is—the reality of the matter in the bright light of day. Being clear-eyed about a problem’s core issues and dimensions is the sine qua non to its satisfactory resolution. Resorting to morality and philosophy are fine when addressing the resolution question, but it is imperative to be realistic about the fundamental problem you are faced with.
I have always felt that the study of the law was an excellent preparation for a career in politics or in the development or execution of public policy. To be sure, one can learn to be an effective public practitioner through other professional disciplines, but, at least in my opinion, the best preparation for a socio-legal gap analysis and the application of an apt legislative solution is legal training. I hasten to add, however, that I think it would be a mistake to have a legislative body solely comprised of lawyers. A policy-making body benefits from a wide range of life experiences. For me and my inclinations though, I was satisfied that legal training would best equip me for public policy analysis and leadership.
We learned all about research methods and how to use the library in that first year. We didn’t have computers then and no access to lightning fast answers to majority and minority rules in any given jurisdiction. Instead we plowed through the books, took copious notes on what we found, painstakingly “shepardized” our cases, as we called it, to ensure that their holdings had not been later overruled or amended, and then laboriously hunt-and-pecked on our old typewriters to complete our research papers.
Well into my second semester, I started to think hard about the final two years of law school, and especially about the prospect of piling up further debt through the scholarship loan, which was still available to me. The GI Bill was another option open to me but only for a few more months since the Korean War was in the process of officially winding down in 1954. I decided to go for it. I kept my own counsel in this process, as I did for most things—master of my own fate kind of thing. This was characteristic of all of my collegiate decision-making, and truly felt throughout my life that I was the one, the only one, really in charge of my destiny. Not to be too dramatic about it, but I felt that I was the one to take my fate—my own fate—into my own hands, that no one could do for me what I was supposed to do for myself.
Truth be told, I had something of an adventurous streak within me. It was related to my natural curiosity and extended to unknown things, places, and experiences, sort of a fascination with things beyond my ken. This curiosity about the unknown later led me to spiritual places that helped me come to terms with my place in the world, and to accept both my disappointments and successes with equanimity—a sense of balance and calm.
In that broader connection, I always both admired and envied my genius nephew, David Schramm (a 6’4” red-headed giant of a man and eldest son of brother Marvin), who was short-listed for a Nobel in astrophysics before his untimely accidental death in 1997 at the age of 52, flying his own plane (having picked up the love of flying airplanes from his father). A physical as well as an intellectual adventurer, Dave climbed mountains on every continent, except Antarctica, despite having several near-death experiences. He learned the rough and tumble side of life as an all-state wrestler as a Missouri high school senior and as a New England heavyweight wrestling champion when he was at MIT. Nearly made the Olympic team, too.
In his other life, David, former chairman of the Department of Astrophysics at the University of Chicago and manager of the Fermilab there, and ever the adventurer, aggressively plumbed the depths of the cosmos, and its Black Holes. In that pursuit, he did much to unite cosmic mysteries with those of particle physics, and found, in this unity, a greater understanding of the Big Bang of creation and the now accepted concept of an ever-expanding universe that followed.
A New York Times remembrance essay by Dennis Overbye following Dave’s death reported that the science community was stunned “that a man described as a force of nature could be gone.” Added British theoretical physicist Stephen W. Hawking, for whom Dave served as best man at his wedding, “. . . David was larger than life in so many ways.” David was looking for ultimate answers—the biggest “why” of all. I am sure that in the quiet confines of his lab, he had an “aha” moment or two, and I would so much like to have seen what Dave saw. I have often wondered if, as the poet John Magee said, he had “touched the face of God.” Doubtless, he has the answers now—and so will we all, some day.
I don’t know if there is an “adventure” gene in some members of the Schramm clan or not (although, in retrospect, as I look at my brothers and some of their offspring, and my own, I might perhaps be persuaded!). Be that as it may, as I stood there in 1954 facing whatever the future held for me, I didn’t know, nor could I, what astonishing dimensions my life would assume in the next few years.
My peers and I had registered for the draft each year beginning at age 18, and those of us in college, like me, had received deferments. So, having decided to take the plunge, I volunteered for the draft, as the procedure was called, and found myself being sworn into the army as a recruit on August 30, 1954. I was 22.
Off they sent me to Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, where I endured eight weeks of basic training, followed by another eight weeks of field artillery training. There, I learned to fire and clean all manner of firearms. Those drill sergeants were a breed apart, but I learned an unforgettable life lesson from their often raging, if not bullying, insistence on just about everything—that “there are no excuses; just get the job done, dammit!” The phrase clearly suits the military mission, but is not bad for the rest of us, too. Like most young people, I had often found a reason to put something off. Thereafter, however, I heard the demands of my drill sergeants ringing in my ears, making me feel compulsive at times.
And, when Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, published her book Lean In in 2012 urging that women take charge of their own lives and, as part of her charge, advising them (and everyone else, for that matter) to “relentlessly prioritize,” I felt an instant resonating connection between her call for urgency in the workplace and that demanded by my drill sergeants, both urging execution and achievement in the face of difficult tasks to be accomplished. Good lessons find ways to reinforce themselves.
Thus, I reconciled the seeming competition between my astrological predilections: Capricorn’s impulse to get the lead out is given direction by my Aquarian why-and-wherefore inquiries to get the humanitarian policy focus right. I’ve always been comfortable with that personality setting.
We were all then to be shipped off for further training, but we had some say-so in the matter. One of the options was to go airborne—strictly for volunteers. I thought that if I had to go into combat, I wanted to be with folks who were better trained for it and good warriors. And then, the adventure streak kicked in, and the thought that followed was that this could really be interesting and challenging and maybe even fun. So, without pondering it further, I volunteered, and was promptly shipped off to the 11th Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, not quite knowing what to expect. The paratroopers there made an immediate impression on me. For one thing, they seemed bigger; for another, their fatigues were starched, pressed, and spotless, and their bloused boots were polished like a mirror. These guys were proud. I liked that.
After processing, I was assigned to the 675 Airborne Field Artillery Battalion, and my company commander was 1st Lt. “Tiger” Jones who virtually growled his orders. His top sergeant was Sgt. DeLaskey whose face looked like my boxer, but who had a gentler side, I later discovered, which he kept well hidden. This was to be my home unit at Fort Campbell, but the first order of business was our airborne training. Actually, the first order of business was PT—physical training. It preceded everything an airborne unit did. We ran for miles at a time, often to a rhythmic cadence sounded off by our trainers. We did hundreds of pushups in a day, usually 20 at a time, interspersed with other forms of calisthenics. We did palms-out pullups, which I had never been able to do before. If a guy was out of sync in an exercise count, he was immediately identified and an order crisply issued, “Drop for 20, soldier!”
What I truly admired and will never forget is the time when the drill sergeant, who was up on a platform and doing all of the calisthenics with us, screwed up his own count, and volunteered, “My mistake! At ease! I will drop for 20,” at which point he dropped to do 20 pushups while the rest of us stood in formation, feet spread, hands clasped behind our backs, watching in stony silence—and with utter respect. If one ever had cause to wonder how these elite units develop such camaraderie and self-sacrifice in their ranks, this is one small illustration. With this physical routine every day, I never harbored any doubt that this was the best physical shape I had ever been in either before or since that time.
Doubtless, the most gratifying consequence of my assignment to this unit was meeting Bill Claggett. Bill had been in the service three or four months longer than I, had been earlier discovered by Sgt. DeLaskey and worked for him as the battery clerk. Bill, from Dayton, Ohio, had two Harvard degrees in city planning and was later to have a great career as a government advisor, professor, and consultant. Bill and I grew close as brothers and became lifelong friends.
Our airborne training proceeded apace. We practiced Parachute Landing Falls—PLFs as we called them—jumping hundreds of times from four foot platforms, learning how to distribute our weight as we hit the ground. Then they had a contraption about three stories high, sort of like a fire tower, where you strapped yourself into a parachute harness with lines attached to a cable above, waited for a jump command, and then threw yourself out of the door trying to keep a tight body position as you were sharply caught by the cable above and your legs fought the restraining harness that wanted to wrench them outward, all the while being zip-wired down to an end-point about fifty yards off.
The idea was to teach us, upon exiting an airplane, to maintain a tight body position—head down, arms clutching your reserve chute below your chest with your right palm over the D-ring, and legs bent slightly but absolutely together—no matter what air pressures were attempting to drive your members apart. If you couldn’t keep your legs together when jumping the tower—and it hurt to do so—then you had to do the tower way more than you wanted to.
After weeks of PT and jump school practice, we finally reached show time—an actual jump. I kept a Jump Log for all sixteen jumps that I made in the service, which identified the date, the drop zone, my stick position, the type of jump, and remarks about any unique features of the jump. All troopers have jump stories, and I would be no different.
March 7, 1955 arrived to mark the first of five qualifying jumps which is the number required to earn your airborne wings. (And I have mine to this day.) All of our jumps were to be from a C-119 aircraft, which looks like a bee and, aerodynamically, is not supposed to be able to fly—a body that looks too big for its wings to carry. But it flew. As battery clerk, Claggett was in charge of preparing the flight manifests—and he did me the dubious favor of placing me in the number one position in four of the five qualifying jumps (number two for the fifth).
That meant I was to be the first one to exit the aircraft from the port side. I was scared dizzy when we took off and, despite the earlier and easy bravado, said to myself, “Just what in the hell am I doing here?” Sitting next to the open port door, I could see the countryside below grow smaller as we climbed to our jump altitude of 1200 feet that day. The jump location was scheduled for the Yamoto Drop Zone (the DZs were named after combat jump locations during World War II).
We flew for about ten uneasy minutes before the jumpmaster began shouting the preparatory jump commands into the intercom: “Stand up and hook up!” was the first. We were lined up in two sticks facing the port and starboard doors. You could hear the clicks of all the static lines hooking onto the eye-level cables that ran the length of the plane for each stick. “Check your equipment!” was the next. We made sure that the static line of the trooper directly in front of us was free and clear of any obstruction and then lamely looked up and down our own harnesses to make sure we were all snapped in. Then the jumpmaster called off the landmarks below: “Highway 41 comin’ up!” A heart-pounding moment later, it was, “Stand in the door!” and I automatically pivoted into the open door, hands slapped against the outside of the plane, the icy air running across my knuckles, my legs bent slightly and then involuntarily giving way to the fear that gripped me, my head staring straight ahead, my last thought being, “I can’t believe I’m doing this!” as my mind then went absolutely blank and switched to auto pilot.
Then the last terrifying command came, as I felt the jumpmaster’s hand whack my rump, “Go!” he shouted, and I went, hurtling down as if in a howling hurricane, the prop wash pitching me into its wake nearly upside down, completely disoriented but trying to keep my body all buttoned up, the roar of the motors much louder on the outside! We were trained to begin a fourcount immediately, and I did: “Hup thousand! Two Thousand! Three Thousand! Four Thousand!” And all of a sudden, it was ghostly quiet! No wind, no motors, no point of reference on a first jump. I didn’t know what to expect. We were instructed to check the parachute canopy after the four-count, so I looked up: it was fully deployed, and I whispered, “Thank you, God!” I was able then to take stock. I felt all alone, pinned to the sky, and euphoric. The 50-60 second ride down was gentle and, without a doubt, the best part of the experience. There was no wind on the DZ and it was an easy landing. Breathing hard from the excitement, I was ecstatic—as were we all!
As we folded up our chutes and headed to the assembly point, the guys exchanged comments on the wonder of it all, but not one admitted—during those moments of self-congratulation and, dare I say, swagger—that he had been scared shitless! Notwithstanding, it was in moments like those that pride gushed in who we were and what we might accomplish together. It was especially felt on our daily runs, during the cadence call, with a collective roar: Air-BORNE! We were brothers. It felt good. It was a standard of togetherness that I never—well, rarely—saw replicated later in society but wished often that we could bottle it—the loyalty, the mutual regard regardless of background, the camaraderie, the brotherhood.
One down. We waited three weeks for the next jumps, and they just did them all at once: two on March 28th and the final two the next day, on March 29th. We would never have them spaced so closely together afterward. But we were official. Shortly thereafter we proudly accepted our airborne wings. The next 11 jumps in my brief airborne career were very exciting—how could they not be? In mass jumps, collisions could occur: one trooper had to spread eagle to keep from flying into my lines; another (involuntarily) landed on top of my chute, as I yelled up to him, “Not a good idea, buddy!” and he clambered off so his chute could re-deploy; and I had a near collision myself but was able to pull hard on my lines to slip by another trooper’s chute. Prop blasts spun me upside down several times. My air was stolen once by a guy who came in under me fairly close to landing, causing my chute to collapse and me to fall the last 25–30 feet, jarring the hell out of me, but nothing was broken thanks to that physical training our commanders insisted on.
Once, on a night jump, we literally could not see anything, and the opening shock produced a riser burn on my face; but the hard part was trying to gauge where the ground was for a landing; I went into my PLF at least five times before actually hitting the ground. And several times on landing, the wind was way up and just re-inflated our chutes and dragged us some 50-75 yards before we could right ourselves. I could hear hilarious laughter and cursing all around me, one friend later saying, “They needed a traffic cop out there to direct us!” Every paratrooper has stories with variations on these themes.
But my seventh jump, on May 16, 1955, was the jump to end all jumps—and it nearly did. One of the most memorable events of my life. I was number four on the starboard stick. Claggett reserved the number one spot for himself, which was okay with me! Believe it or not, as I was picking up my pre-packed chute (paratroopers had long since stopped packing their own; a special unit did that), I had a twinge that almost said, no, not that one. But I recovered quickly and chalked it up to pre-jump jitters. I should have listened. We were to jump from 1000 feet that day. Again, the C-119 was our aircraft. The jumpmaster barked the usual commands as we approached the Los Baños (Philippines) Drop Zone. We stood, hooked up, checked equipment and shuffled forward, almost touching one another, waiting for the red light next to the open door to turn green, which was the pilot’s signal to the jumpmaster that we had arrived at the DZ.
I could see the green light flash and heard the jumpmaster’s “Go!” as the pandemonium began; the rush to the door was filled with yelling and cussing (as I had found out later when I was back in the ranks and not the first one out); everyone was eager to get out the door (for some inexplicable reason!), and I just followed along, minus the screaming. At the number four position, it was only a matter of a few seconds before my turn came. I had learned, in those terrible moments, to shut down all thinking and just charge out the door, literally throwing caution to the winds. I tumbled in the gale but kept a tight body position as I began my count—hup-thousand on down to four thousand! I looked up to check my canopy, and found to my shocking surprise that the lines were furled up, kind of like a squid, with a bit of a puff at the very top of the canopy. I was hurtling down and was in a straight up-and-down position. I looked down and saw the ground just whooshing up at me, and decided not to do that again.
I was operating on pure adrenalin, my training kicked-in to automatic, I grasped the D-Ring on my reserve chute strapped on my front, and, instinctively knowing that this was not a time to think things over, pulled hard. I had never had occasion to resort to my reserve chute before, but we were told to feed it out to the wind, and I started to do that. Parachutes can steal air from each other, and, even though the main wasn’t deployed, it was preventing my reserve’s ability to deploy. So I decided instantaneously to maximize the chances of the main to deploy over the reserve chute, and began to haul in the reserve chute. I had done everything that I knew to do and was on the verge of losing hope when, all of a sudden, the main chute popped and I was on the ground hard within another second or two in a clump of trees, off the DZ.
Someone came running up to me and breathlessly asked, “Do you know where your chute opened?” You can’t gauge heights when you’re falling, so, full of optimism over my gift of life, I guessed, saying, “I don’t know—maybe 300 feet up?” And he said, “See the top of that tree? That’s where your chute opened!” The tree was maybe 60 to 75 feet tall. I could hardly believe it! They used to tell us that if you threw a sack of potatoes the weight of an average man out of an airplane 1,000 feet up it would land in about eight seconds. Everything I’ve described happened in rapid succession, and I estimate that the time it took me to reach the ground from the moment I exited the aircraft was no more than 10 to 12 seconds.
I began a conversation with God as I walked back to the assembly point. We got to know each other a lot better from then on. I saw Bill and he said he saw someone whistling by him on the way down, assuming the worst, not knowing it was me. The commanding officer seemed to be more concerned about the reasons for the malfunctioning parachute than about my wellbeing, but finally came over and asked if I was okay. Whenever a “bad” jump happens, they try to get you back up as soon as possible to ward off the evil spirits, so the CO said something to that effect to one of the ranking noncoms in our unit to ensure that I would have another jump soon. We usually jumped every month or so, sometimes two. I was up the following week, and that one went smoothly, as these things go. I said nothing to my family about all of this until after I was discharged from the service.
As it happened, May 16 was Bill’s birthday, so we began celebrating that date as the birthday for both of us. Years later I used to observe two birthdays during the course of a year, but Dorian insisted that I had to choose just one. So I chose my re-birth of May 16. Besides, it made me 23 years younger than my original birthday, and that’s the one we observe to this day.
That parachute jump had a profound effect on my life, and on my view of life as a precious estate. It also marked the beginning of a spiritual journey for me that has deepened and enriched my life beyond measure. I could have exited my life at that time. But it was given back to me. I like to think that there was a reason, and, because of it, that maybe I should hold myself to a high standard—not a high-er standard. I believe we all should hold ourselves to a high standard, but everyone is in charge of his or her own commitment and journey to reach that higher plane.
I have chosen to take my journey quite seriously, and to use this gift of life, as my lights might allow, in service to others. The injunction to “repair the world” took on a whole new dimension for me, and I saw it not only as a fundamental Judaic teaching, but as a universal teaching that is equally reflected in all the great religions of the world. We don’t have to fight with one another over whose religion says it best. I believe we are all endowed with a spark of the Divine and that our true selves will live on beyond this “mortal coil.” But we each have a responsibility to make this life a good one for everyone, and we can do that by first recognizing that we are all part of one human family—with Divine roots.
How could this not influence my political view of the world? Interestingly, in recent years when I have tried to teach democracy to Muslims in the Middle East, I always sought to invoke the teachings of Muhammad who—wisely—enjoins his followers to respect the worth of the other person. It follows, I maintain, that such mutual respect is the beginning of problem-solving without resort to violence, and, as the circle of this practice widens, a more peaceful world is thereby given a chance to unfold. This mutual respect is often expressed as love, or kindness, or good will. They all work. And while progress has been made, I needn’t list the proofs that we still have a long way to go. For all we know, perhaps the history of this planet—whether as a place of good will or a destroyed wasteland—will be measured by the success, or lack thereof, of our aggregated individual journeys to make it a better place. As I see it, each of us thus bears some responsibility for our shared destiny, and—though it’s not for me to say—perhaps some accountability, too.
Meanwhile, as we settled back to earth, the friendship between Bill Claggett and me deepened. In August, 1955, we were transferred en masse to the storied 82nd Airborne Division at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina, where we continued our airborne training on the Drop Zones of Normandy, Salerno, and Holland. I was assigned to the Headquarters Detachment of division headquarters, instead of a line unit, where I assume the personnel folks thought my college education could be most effectively used. And there I remained until my tour ended a year later.
Claggett was assigned to another unit, but we maintained our close friendship and saw one another frequently. We mused about the prospect of international travel together after our service tours were over. We became serious about it, and began speculating about where we might go. I took it upon myself to begin writing embassies to find out about visa requirements. That brought me into contact, unbeknownst to me at the time, with the Counter-Intelligence Corps.
We were in the midst of the Cold War with the Soviet Union at the time, and there was great uncertainty about the future. Senator Joseph McCarthy began stirring up the people with incendiary accusations, without proof, about Communist affiliations. I sat in on one of McCarthy’s hearing during my Colgate semester in Washington, and he was indeed a bully. While McCarthy was condemned by the Senate on December 2, 1954, for “conduct that tended to bring the Senate into dishonor and disrepute,” the social context in the country was nevertheless one of great anxiety.
Into that milieu, I blithely and naively sent a letter to the Soviet Embassy in Washington—along with a dozen or two similar letters to other embassies—seeking information on travel to and within the Soviet Union and what visa requirements a traveler might be expected to meet. I saved everything—copies and responses—neatly clipped in a file that I kept in the bottom drawer of my desk in my office. Well, that letter of inquiry to the Soviet Embassy precipitated a wide-ranging espionage investigation into me. I didn’t find out about it until just before my discharge, when my good friend and barracks bunk neighbor, Johnny Byrd, said to me, “Jack, I think I can tell you now that your case has been closed.”
Jack Schramm
Passionate Purpose: A Global Goverance Journey
21 ratings","Passionate Purpose: A Global Governance Journey written by Jack J. Schramm. This is a memoir of Jack's global governance journey. He started his memoir way back to his birth, to his grandparents's lives outside of Kiev (known as Ukraine today), and their families undocumented immigration settlements in America. He included a snippet of his younger days down to his college life. There are several things to ponder on his younger days, like leading a group of people who want to voice out their concerns through Jack's leadership. What I loved the most in Jack's memoir was his motorcycle adventure with Cliff Johnson. Readers will notice how Jack and Cliff were treated in the Islamic country. Furthermore, his sudden marriage in Morocco was quite stunning, as was his political journey. Honestly, I like the way Jack highlighted his political career. Readers will realize that sometimes you lose for a greater purpose. Through Jack's excellence in judicial experience, his life became more fruitful as he expanded his leadership internationally, particularly dealing with a healthy environment. The least thing that I liked was the length of the book; however, the last part of his memoir makes the reader long for more from Jack's excellency in leadership. I am happy to rate this book 5 out of 5 stars because the book is perfectly written. It flows smoothly with interesting topics about his family, politics, leadership, and friendships. I admired a lot from Jack's leadership, especially during his global work. Through his memoir, I learned that my country has the wrong political US adaptation when implementing the law. I recommend this book to a person who loves reading memoirs, especially about the judicial system, politics, or law. Those people who are involved in political leadership or practicing law will definitely acquire new ideas from Jack's memoir."

DAVID TORE AT the tangle of sheets, entrapping his arms and legs like an overzealous wrestler pinning his opponenttothemat,untilhewasfree.Salttearsweldedhiseyesshut.Theyburnedasherubbedattheirencrustedcorners.Thereitwasagain.Thething.
He flung the sweat-soaked pillows to the floor and scrabbled against the headboard until there was no more roomtomove.
He couldn’t swallow; a thickness constricting his breathing, like a cork stopper. He grasped at his left templeattemptingtocalmthediscordantthrumminginhishead.
He tried to call out but couldn’t speak. He was at the mercy of the thing, mesmerized by the dark eyes that hauntedhimeverynight.
He cleared his throat and with more bravery than he had, he cried out, “What do you want?”
Nothing.
“What unholy thing are you?”
Still no answer.
From an early age he had experienced these night terrors. His mother would murmur to him, “It was just a baddream,honey.Gobacktosleep.”Andsecureinhismother’scomfortingarms,hewould.
As the nightmares intensified his worried parents sought help for him; the endless stream of doctors, psychiatristsandspecialistsreassuringhimandhisparentshewouldoutgrowthis,andforalongtimethedreamsdidstop.
Now approaching thirty years of age, the debilitating dreams had returned. More intense than ever. Since Decemberoflastyear,hewasoncemoreoppressedbythenightlyapparition,itsblackbottomlesseyesdrawinghimintoitscircleofevil.
As swiftly as the vision had come, it was gone. He wiped the beads of perspiration from his forehead and switchedonthelightonthebedstand,openedthetopdrawerandpulledouthisjournal.Tokeephisrighthandfromshaking,hegraspedhiswristwithhislefthandandbegantowrite.

Embarrassed, he scratched the last line out; his psychiatrist would never approve of him writing such a thing.Especiallywhenhehadconvincedthedoctorthathenowbelievedtheeyestobeafigmentofhisimagination,aremnantfromhischildhood,bestattributedtothedreamworld.

When the alarm rang at seven-thirty, he was surprised. I must have had some sleep. He stretched his long, muscularlegsandgotoutofthebed.Withoneenormouslunge,hereachedthespaciousbathroom.
The bathroom’s light turned on automatically as he entered. The sink, a transparent bowl flecked with gold,atoptheblackmarblecounter,shimmeredunderthefluorescentlight.
David grimaced at his reflection in the mirror.

He padded back to his bedroom and pulled on an old shirt and sweatpants before he headed to his personal gym.
The gym was laid out efficiently, with economic use of space. Against one wall was a Bowflex Home Gym weightmachine,ontheoppositewallstoodaConcept2RowErgrowingmachineandaNautilus
Elliptical Trainer. A yoga mat lay at the center of the polished wood floor. A fifty inch large screen television occupiedthefarwall.

After the exercise, meditation, and a long hot shower, David had regained his equilibrium. Over a quick breakfastoftoastandfriedeggs(notthehealthiestchoice,heknew,buthis‘goto’comfortfood)hecheckedthenewsfeedsonBloombergandtheCanadianBroadcastCorporation.
Then he answered a few emails before checking his agenda on his iPad. This morning, he was scheduled to spendafewhoursatthelawfirmheranwithhisuncle,andthenmeetanewclientforlunchatoneo’clock.

After his vigorous workout, he decided not to walk down the fourteen flights of stairs of his condo, but insteadtooktheelevator.Thedoorsslidopen,andheenteredthespaciouslobby.
“Morning,” he said, nodding to the desk clerk.
“Morning, Mr. Harris. It’s a fine summer day,” said the clerk. “Have a good one.”
“You, too.”
David blinked at the bright, sun-filled street and descended the steps to the sidewalk below. He was struck againbyhowpreposteroushis
experience from the night before had been.
Did other people see strange things like he did? Surely not everyone imagined apparitions. There must be sometruthtostoriesandsightingsreportedoverthecenturies.Phantomshipsseenbyhundredsofpeopleatatime.Ghostswalkingaboutwiththeghastlyevidenceoftheirdeaths;some
of those sightings must be real.

A worried voice asked, “Are you all right?”

“You cumbersome? Or a fool? Hardly,” she laughed. David flushed as he saw her gaze linger on his chest and arms.
“I’m Emma Jackson,” she said, stretching out her hand.
He shook her hand. “Nice to meet you, Emma. My name’s David Harris.”
“Come on, let’s go get that coffee,” she said, smiling. “I think we could both use one.”

Café Mokka
THE CAFÉ MOKKA was almost empty of patrons. The morning rush was over; frenetic commuters needingtheircaffeinefixforthedayhadpickeduptheirordersandwerenowatwork.
The twenty something barista’s nametag displayed Megan, they/them in bold gold letters. Their right eyebrowraisedslightlyastheylookedattheattractivemanstandingbyEmma’sside.“HiEm,you’reinlaterthanusual.WhatcanIgetforyouandyourfriend?”
“Hi Megan. I’ll have a green tea.” Emma turned toward him and said, “And what about you, David?”
He was inwardly delighted by the soft, intimate way she’d called him by his first name. “An espresso, please.”
David opened his wallet to pay, but Emma had already swiped her phone over the terminal. She placed her handonhis,andsaid,“Yourturnnexttime.”
A warm rush of pleasure pulsed through him at the thought there would be a next time and knew at that verymomenthecouldeasilystartfallingforher.
“Go have a seat, I’ll bring your orders to you,” said Megan.
David and Emma sat at a little table covered with a blue and white checkered tablecloth with matching seat covers,andbeforelongtheyfellintoeasyconversation.They’dbothforgottentheterribleincidentthatcouldhaveoccurredhadEmmanotsteppedonthebrakeswhenshedid.Itwasrefreshingtochatwithsomeonewhosharedmanyofthesameinterests,suchasenvironmentalissues,yoga,physicalfitness,andglobalevents.

Emma couldn’t remember when she last had such a great time talking with someone.

The more they spoke, the more curious she became. She was certain there was a heavy burden of sorrow in hislifewhichhekepthidden,buthecarriedhimselfwithcourage.
Emma’s thoughts were interrupted when David asked, “And what do you think of the present stand the provincialgovernmentistakingwithBill23?”
She gasped, realizing she had lost at least half of the conversation leading up to the question. “I’m sorry,” she stammered.“Iwasdaydreaming.”
To her surprise, genuine amusement sparkled in his eyes. “Don’t worry, who wants to discuss the present politicalsituationinOntarioanyway?”
She returned his generous smile with one of her own. “Sure, you’re right, however, the loss of wildlife habitatandourgreenbeltisofgraveconcerntome,asitshouldbetousall.Weneedtobettermanageourgreenspacesandbuildingmega-highwaysandsprawlingsuburbsoverouragriculturallandsisunacceptableandnotasolutionforthehousingshortage.”
“It is a serious problem,” David agreed. He looked at his wristwatch. “I should get going. I’m meeting a new clientatoneandI’vegottocompletesomeworkbeforehand.”
Disappointed to part company, Emma stood to shake his hand. “It was great meeting you.”
“I’d really like to see you again.” He kept her hand in his. “I hope you feel the same.”
Her face grew warm.
“Sure, I’d like that.”
“Great. How about this Friday?”
Trying not to sound too eager, she said, “Friday evening would be just fine.” Before she could curb her enthusiasm,sheblurtedout,“Where?”
“How about some place nice?”
“Sure, what do you have in mind?”
“Amelia’s. Let’s say eight.”
“Sounds great. I’ll be there.” Emma hesitated. “Do you know if they have vegetarian options on the menu?”
“Not sure.” David picked up his phone, pressed on the home button, and said, “Siri, menu options for Amelia’sFineDining.”Hescrolleddownwithhisrightthumb.“TripAdvisorsaysAmelia’shasgreatvegetarianandveganoptions.”
“That’s perfect.”
“I see you have an iPhone too. I’ll airdrop my details to you in case we need to contact each other.”
Seconds later, Emma’s phone chirped. “Got it. See you Friday.”

The Client
FOR THE FIRST time in ages, David had forgotten his troubles and enjoyed spending time with a genuine andlovelyperson.
His steps were light as he climbed the gray worn steps to the building where the law office was situated, his thoughtspreoccupiedwiththebeautifulEmma.Hewasgratefulforthebizarreturnofeventsthathadledtomeetingherandwashappyshehadagreedtoseehimagain.
Stepping off the elevator at the fourth floor, he opened the door to the offices he shared with Liam Foster, hismother’sbrother.
“Morning, Uncle Liam.”
He peeked at the bespeckled man seated at his desk. His suit jacket was hanging off the back of the chair and hisshirtsleeveswererolleduptotheelbows.Atsixty-two,hiswhitehairwasthinningatthetop,buthehadtheenergyanddriveofamanyearsyounger.Pilesoffolderswerespreadoverthelargewoodendesk.
“Good morning, David. Unusual for you to be running late.”
“Almost got hit by a car.”
Liam slid his wire rimmed reading glasses to the edge of his nose and surveyed his nephew with alarm, thenrelaxedwhenhenoticedhewasgrinning.“Whathappened?”
“I met a girl,” said David.
“So, you were talking figuratively,” Liam said.
“No, I really did almost get hit by a car.” David gave a sheepish smile. “Driven by a gorgeous girl.”
“Hmph. I see.” Although it didn’t sound like he saw at all.
“She was sorry about this whole thing, so she invited me for coffee at the Café Mokka.”
“Nice girl, then.”
“Very nice girl.”
“Are you going to see her again?”
“Yeah, this Friday,” David was unable to suppress his excitement.
“About time you met someone special,” Liam smiled.
David whistled under his breath as he entered his private office, hung his coat up in the closet behind his deskandgottowork.

The most fascinating part of the man, however, was his huge and hooded eyes. David was both magnetized andrepelledbythem.Thiswassomeonenottodisappoint.Togoagainstthewishesofthisformidablepersoncouldbecatastrophic.
Shaking off his misgivings, David extended his hand and said, “How do you do, Mr. Bianchi. I trust that you arekeepingwell.”
“Oh, infinitely well,” smiled the man through thin lips, though the eyes seemed dead and betrayed no emotion atall.“YoucancallmeEnrico.”
“And please call me David.” He paused. “You mentioned over the phone that you would like to meet over lunch.Didyouhaveaplaceinmind?”
The older man shook his head, and said, “It doesn’t really matter. I trust your choice of restaurant.”
This flattery did not go unnoticed by David. “Very well, may I suggest Manicotti’s across the street? The walkisshort,andtheirItalianfoodisexcellent.”
“Let’s be on our way then,” said Enrico.

Over lunch, Enrico observed the articulate and self-assured young lawyer.

The server refilled Enrico’s wine glass then turned to David, who placed his hand over the glass.
“No, grazie.” He was unaccustomed to drinking during the day and knew the one glass was sufficient.
The server nodded and said, “Perhaps you would prefer a sparkling water?”
“A Pellegrino if you have it.”
“Yes, of course.”
After the hour-long delicious meal was finally consumed, the men sipped their espressos. Enrico gave a contentedburp,whichDavidtookasasignaltobegin.
“So, how can I help you?” he asked.
“My company is developing an affordable residence for seniors.” Enrico took a sip of the rich Italian caffé ristrettobeforehecontinued.“Weneedanindependentlawyertoreviewthecontractswithpotentialinvestors,sotheyunderstandwhattheyarecommittingtobeforetheysignup.”
“I’ll need to review all the documentation before I agree to take on this project.”

He stood, reached in his pocket for his wallet and withdrew a thick wad of cash. Peeling off a couple hundred-dollarbills,hethrewthemonthetableandleftwithoutanotherword.

David sat opposite his psychiatrist, Dr. Weiss, expressing his frustrations. “I’m not sure this treatment is working.”
“It’s important to give psychotherapy time,” the doctor said. “Please be patient.”
“I’m tired of all this talk. Looking for reasons behind the dreams. I had a happy childhood.”
“And yet you display clear signs of trauma. This indicates an event of great significance and through the dreamsyoursubconsciousistryingtogetyoutoworkitout.”
“Maybe.” David frowned. “I’m not convinced.”
Dr. Weiss looked at his watch, “Time is up for this session. Would you like to schedule one for next week, sametime?”
“Let me think about it.”
Dr. Weiss stood up and shook David’s hand. “Call my receptionist when you’re ready to see me again.”
“I’m not sure I’ll be back.”
“I don’t recommend stopping the psychotherapy sessions abruptly,” said the doctor, concerned. “May I ask why?”
“The sessions are not helping me. I need solutions.” David sighed with frustration. “Not more talk.”
“You need to give this time.”
“Nah, I’m done.”
“If you change your mind, my door is always open.”
“Thanks.”
After each visit, his sense of helplessness increased. The doctor had told him to be patient, that his recurringdreamwouldnotlastforever.That’sright,hethoughttohimself,maybewhenIdie.Orperhapsthenit’lllastforeternity.Whoknows?

Maybe it is time to move out, Emma thought, as she tamed her long, curly auburn hair into a chignon.
Although her mom said they should consider themselves roomies, it was still hard not to think of Laura Jacksonasanyoneexcepthermom.AfterEmma’sfather’ssuddendeath,sheandhermotherhadbecomeveryprotectiveofoneanother.

“Mom, are you in there?” she asked.

“Mrs. Linden asked me to design a new gown for her upcoming fundraising gala, but as usual, she’s left it a littlelate.Shedidn’tevencomeinforherfirstfittingtillthismorning.”
Amanda Linden was chair of the organization called Protecting Nature and Keeping it Green.
“The gala is just one week away,” she added.

“A tight deadline, but not impossible to meet,” said Emma.
“True, but it will mean working late nights, and that’s a strain on my eyes,” said her mom, sighing with frustration.
“Well, I hope you are charging her a premium.”
“No, just my standard fee. Mrs. Linden’s one of my best clients and my best advocate.” Her mom smiled and said,“Youlookpretty.Goingout?”
“Yeah, meeting some friends downtown.” Emma’s phone chirped. “Mom, my Uber is here. Gotta go. I’m late.Loveyou.”

Emma was surprised when the Uber driver got out, walked to her side of the car and opened the door for her.
“Thanks so much,” she said.
“No problem,” said the driver. “Just use the app if you need a ride home.”
Emma raced up the steps of the establishment, a bit breathless both from the exertion and excitement of seeing Davidagain.Notpayingattention,shetrippedandfellforwardonthetopstep,herrighthandandwristtakingthebruntofthefall.Shegotup,wigglingherfingersandrotatingherwristtoreassureherselfnomajordamagehadbeendone,excepttoherpride.
Feeling unraveled, she asked the maître d’, “Could you direct me to the restroom, please?”
“Sure; are you okay?”
Emma nodded, “My pride’s a bit hurt, but I’m fine. Just need to straighten up.”
“It’s down the hall to the right.”
Emma reached the doors to the restroom, and threw herself in, nearly knocking over a matronly lady. She recognizedherasoneofherschoolteachersfromhighschool,Mrs.Hunter.
“Oh my, I am so sorry,” said Emma.
“Emma? Emma Jackson from my tenth-grade math class?” asked her former teacher. “I see you are as gracefulasever.”Herwordsdrippedwithsarcasm.

“Hello how can I help you? My name is Karl,” he said, his tone filled with admiration.
“Hi Karl. I’m here to meet David Harris,” she said. Her voice now calm, lovely and musical.
“I’m sorry, Mr. Harris has not arrived yet, but I do see he made a reservation for two at eight this evening.”
Emma glanced at her Movado wristwatch and saw it was just a few minutes after eight.
“You can sit in the lounge area while you wait,” Karl offered.
A brush of wind gusted by as the front door opened and closed and she heard a baritone say, “That won’t be necessary.Karl,couldyoutakeustoourtable?”
“Certainly, Mr. Harris. Please follow me.”
David leaned close to her, and lightly kissed her cheek. He whispered, “You look lovely.” He offered her his armandsaid,“Shallwe?”
Emma hoped David hadn’t noticed the heat that flared in her cheeks the moment their arms had touched.

For Amy and Jeremy





My sincere thanks go to those of you in the administrative trenches: Amy and Nicole at Brigade Southern for making it happen; Joanne, for your unflinching support; Cheryl, Dale, Barbara D., Karen, and Patricia for your critical input…
…as well as trail angels Jeremy, Joanne (again), Terri, Joe, Barb C., Barbara M., Robin and the Phi Lambda Phi Sorority House, Sha and the Toronto Afghans, Gay-LeClerc, Dot, Sherdil, Scott, Trista, Kay, Chuck, Molly, Nick C., John V. and Jerry S.
Last but not least, Patti R. for giving me my first real diary with that first page waiting to be filled.
Preface
“A merry Christmas is having someone to hold the ribbon on the package with their finger while you tie the bow.”
I made this diary entry one Christmas Eve, probably over a glass of wine or two. I was recently separated from my wife and kids, two months into a new job working in an institution for emotionally disturbed youth, broke, and wallowing in self-pity. But, lamenting over that missing extra finger, presumably attached to a human hand, which might be attached to a body and a mind possibly capable of intimacy, is not the tone you’ll find in the ensuing diaries.
Confused or unclear rather than pitiful would be a better descriptor of my immersion in life, at least that part of it depicted in these pages. Although I’ve been at sea for years, for some unknown reason I’ve had the clarity – or was it the need – to document many of my forays on paper. Some of these escapades – whether I won or fell flat on my face, I planned and initiated. Others, I simply woke up one day and found myself in the game, or on the bench. For strength or moral support, writing in a diary was a substitute for that finger holding the ribbon.
In life I find myself responding to the simplest events – a comment by a supermarket cashier or the discovery of a box of books discarded at the curb. Maybe this is because I can’t grasp the bigger things in life, or maybe it’s the realness of the little things that makes them seem big to me.
In contrast to writing about unplanned and seemingly insignificant events is the journal I kept of my 565-mile, 24-day trek on foot around Lake Ontario. That, of course, was planned. Then there’s the journal I didn’t even realize I was amassing back in boot camp when I was jotting notes – my only option for reacting to how utterly awful boot camp was. I definitely couldn’t complain to the Company Commander.  (Excerpts from that particular adventure are in my book Learning to Walk.). These written documentations might be called diaries. Or perhaps I was keeping records, to be referenced at some later point in life. Reading first-hand accounts is often better than trying to remember or tell someone else what happened. An attorney I once heard speak in a workshop about divorce litigation suggested his clients should document in real time abusive or otherwise inappropriate behavior on the part of their soon to be ex.
For example, present-tense/real-time documentation, or journaling, can pack more punch in a courtroom than recalling what happened in past tense.
Weak: Plaintiff adlibbing her recollection – “Your Honor, he came home drunk all the time. It was hard on the family.”
Stronger: Plaintiff, reading from her diary – “March 23rd: It’s 8:00 p.m. A school night. He can’t get his key in the front door. I don’t know whether to let him in or run out the back door. I can’t run; the girls are upstairs getting ready for bed.”
I believe present-tense, real-time documentation can be as engaging in a personal diary, with no intention of going before a judge. Or, maybe my journaling was taking notes for that ultimate presentation of myself, the one we’re all destined to face in front of that famous bearded judge.
St. Peter (speaking to me): “Dude, sorry, but, well, you’ve come to the wrong door.”
Weak Me: “But, but…!”
Stronger Me: “No, wait a minute!” (I whip out Volume II, Section B of my diary) “Look what you dealt me here – what, sixteen different jobs? You couldn’t park me in one comfy spot? And again here – Section D – both my cars repo’d? And how about this one…”
St. Peter clears his throat and looks down at the floor (or clouds, I guess) for an answer…
Me: “Am I right or am I right?!”
Further, writing in the present and telling it the way it’s actually happening makes it real, and to me there is more power in that realness than there is in the more fictional or fantastical things that you wanted to happen or should have been said.
In 2021, during the COVID-related chaos that restricted socialization, I came across some of my old journals. They’d been off my radar for some time, hiding in liquor store boxes over the course of several moves and several years. One of the journals I found and have excerpted herein is one I kept in my mid-thirties while working in the aforementioned institution for emotionally disturbed youth.
I described the residents in my trust, some of the unfortunate circumstances that led to their placement, their often-inappropriate behavior, and our (staff) response to that behavior, along with the daily, often disruptive events of the unit. (When writing I used their real names – today, illegal – so I could keep things straight. Transposing to this book I’ve used code names to protect privacy). Initially, I wrote only on the right-hand pages because I didn’t want to smear the ink on the opposite page with my hand when I went back to add afterthoughts. One evening, though, without plan, I turned the journal around – upside down, and began writing, starting at the back of the book, now describing the people – the staff I worked with, again on the right-hand pages. I’d discovered by this time that besides we – the staff – having the keys to the meds and the food pantry, and the kids not having the keys, the difference between the challenged kids and some of the staff, myself included, was a really gray area.
The section of this book called Going the Distance could be its own book. It is a dozen excerpts from the many pages in which I documented my sixteen years of driving back-and-forth on weekends, parenting my daughter and son – a total of 150,000 miles – six times around the world. Beginning from pre-school to finishing college; graduating from disposable diapers to heavy metal. This adventure occurred in part during the time I worked with the institutionalized kids and the two stories or diaries are juxtaposed herein.
Another journal I picked up during COVID was from my Lake Ontario walk-around. I readied for this monster trek for two years, walking off 50 pounds just in the preparation process. I set out on a rainy July day and walked from dawn ‘til dusk for 24 days, doing my business where the dogs and squirrels do theirs. I slept under the stars – in campgrounds, churchyards, cemeteries, and in cheap motels. In Toronto I stayed with Afghanistan refugees; back in the U.S. I was taken in for a night by a single woman; in Oswego I was given macaroni and cheese and a night’s shelter as the guest of four sisters in a Greek sorority house.
I considered whether to include, here, my journal, Rekindling Scorched Earth, where I retraced, on foot, the 18th century trail of the military expedition carried out against the Iroquois Indians of New York as part of the American Revolutionary War. On the one hand, it’s based on articles I wrote for three different newspapers rather than being a personal diary, per se.
I was writing about an historical event; however, much of the color of the story comes from actual journals kept by some of the soldiers involved in that 1779 campaign, so I’ve included it – in effect, my diary about the soldiers’ diaries.
To lighten things up I’ve included excerpts from my day-to-day diary. No mental institution; no long walk; no treatise on divorce. Just inconsequential observations and responses to the simple events of daily life.
Definitely not the least of these journals is the last one in the book, The Longest Day, which is excerpted from the journal I kept on my 25-day, 625-mile Lake Erie walk-around. That “day” was the living nitty gritty of pushing oneself almost too far. It was an up-close brush with hypothermia and a mental ass-kicking when I lived it. Looking back, it was a psychological milestone, a day when snafus ruled but thankfully the strength of humanity, personal endurance and perseverance, along with the intervention of a couple trail angels, came together to win over the force of Mother Nature and my own naiveté – a functional handicap I carry and brandish like a capital “N” stamped on my forehead. Sometimes even when I’m not walking or pushing myself.









God bless the simple man.
- Johnny Van Zant, American singer
I am a simple man and I want simple answers.
- Howard Aiken, inventor of the first computer
I’m just a simple man standing alone with my old brushes, asking God for inspiration.
                                                      - Peter Paul Rubens, Artist




Apology
As you’ll see, one of the character traits of a simple man is that he takes himself too seriously.
Rich Gardner, 2nd from right, 1956









PART I: CROSSING BORDERS
KEEP MOVING
Walking eastward along the north shore of Lake Ontario, I’ve put Toronto one hundred miles and four days behind me. I’m in the rural Canadian countryside, in the Township of Wellington. As I make my way along the shoulder of the narrow lakefront road I see a man up ahead, cutting his lawn on a riding mower, look up from his work at hand and spot me. He breaks from his back-and-forth pattern and makes a diagonal swath across his yard – bisecting all those neatly mowed parallel lines, directly toward me. He pulls onto the shoulder just ahead of me and shuts off his machine so it falls silent as we come abreast.
“I passed you earlier this morning walking, way back,” he says, climbing off the mower and nodding in the direction from which I’ve come. “You must be going a long way.”
“I’m walking around the lake,” I say.
He lights a cigarette, takes a drag, stares at me, and asks, “What lake?”
“Lake Ontario,” I say, nodding toward the body of water that stretches from where we are standing in his yard to all points on the horizon.
He takes another drag on his cigarette, a long one, exhaling slowly. With his free hand he busies himself closing the little book of matches and returning them to his shirt pocket, glancing away from me, as he seems no longer comfortable looking me in the eye.
Sensing I’m not going to back down from my lake walking claim and admit I’m either homeless or ran out of gas, he says, “Well, it’s a good day for it.”
He’s looking at his mower; he’s sorry he got off it, he’s sorry he made those diagonal wheel marks across the neatly spaced rows. He wants to be back on his mower with the engine running and me gone. I can simply wish my doubter a good day, continue on my way, and avoid further questioning of the legitimacy of my claim.
But, here’s a man who’s stepped out of his normal routine to ask me what I’m doing; he deserves an answer; one he can believe. Or, is it I, who’s stepped out my routine, who needs validation?
I reiterate, “I’m walking around the lake,” again nodding at the water, “It’s about five hundred and fifty miles. I started in Rochester, New York on the fourth. I came around the west end of the lake and hit Toronto on the tenth day…”
My smoking waterfront landowner is still not looking at me, but at the ground. Aha, it just occurred to me, I have an ace in my sleeve that I haven’t pulled.
“I was on TV – Cable 6, the six o’clock news – in Toronto, on the fourteenth…”
His head snaps to attention and his expression changes almost in cartoon-like affectation. “Oh!” he exclaims, with raised Elmer Fudd eyebrows.
If it weren’t for TV, an arch-symbol of the daily routine I’m trying to escape by being out here on foot, he might never have believed me. As it now is, though, the fact I’ve made the lake suddenly doable and am truly walking around it seems to fall on him like more information than he wants in his private world of household chores.
As I turn away and continue walking, I’m just out of sight of the complacent, unimaginative man when I realize I was not that much unlike him in the not-too-distant past.
On the morning of July 4, 1997, I set out to walk around Great Lake Ontario, a body of water whose surface area of 7,300 square miles renders it thirty times the size of the Dead Sea. The preceding vignette constitutes perhaps five minutes of the twenty-four days I spent hoofing it around the lake’s circumference.
Backing up
In the mid-1990s, I was going through a divorce, an event I initiated. I’ll skip the “he said – she said.” We were simply incompatible; we couldn’t get along. This issue continued even after I’d moved out. The divorce, like the marriage, wasn’t taking the path I’d hoped. We both worked and earned about the same. There were no custody issues; they were her kids and college age. This was her and my second marriage. There was no infidelity issue. This seemed a textbook case for a 50-50 handshake agreement; no speedbumps.
Early on it appeared to be just that; however, the attorney my wife hired (who, I learned, was reputed to have thrown her own ex-husband through an aluminum storm door) subscribed to a different playbook. What I had once envisioned as simply signing my name to legal papers and collecting my share of the modest equity in our house turned into a conflict with seemingly no treaty on the horizon. Time dragged on. What might have taken a couple months took almost two years. And the distribution of assets? Suffice it to say, whatever my wife paid that husband-hurler, she got her money’s worth, which left me unable to settle some financial matters for which I was, by agreement, responsible.
During this delightful episode of my life, I’d begun retreating to a nearby beach for a walk along the shore of Great Lake Ontario – Durand Beach. I’d drive there at dawn, before work, trying to reclaim myself. More accurately, trying to figure out exactly who, at fifty, “myself” was.
I was living alone now after living in a house with three other dynamic people – my wife and her two sons, and was financially strained due to legal expenses, including having to buy a car. I was also still making payments to my first wife for money she’d fronted for some of the college expenses of our own two kids. My situation begged the questions: Where am I? Where have I been? Where am I going? I already had one ex-wife. When the new ink dried, I’d have two. I had a divorce attorney who was too laidback, and an IRS case manager who wasn’t. Standing on the beach, mornings, I felt if I looked too closely out over Ontario’s waters, I’d see on the horizon, along with a distant oil tanker, a handmade raft from my childhood constructed of inner tubes and plywood, carrying the office cubicle from my present, touting a sign in its doorway threatening the imminent arrival of my own “Best-if-used-by…” date. And this craft was heading straight for me.
I walked from one end of the beach to the other, about a mile each way. The distance invigorated me without tiring me out. At that hour it was deserted but for a lone jogger or person walking their dog. The soft but firm sand pushing against the soles of my feet as I walked confirmed for me I was indeed supposed to be here. The mystical aroma of an ever-changing Great Lakes stew wafted in the air, the mammoth sun slowly rose from the horizon and the gulls screamed overhead. These stimuli sparked reflection, which led to realizations. Some mornings I couldn’t stop the stream.
I regularly found myself carving crude thumbnail Aha! notes into my Styrofoam coffee cup or calling in more detailed epiphanies to the voicemail on my office landline.
I explored myself – my feelings, my personhood, my place on earth – the world as I knew it; a world presently confined to my job. While bills might pile up and team members defect to the opposition, I was safe in that cubicle. I wrote resumes for clients so they could further immerse themselves, advance themselves, in their own cubicles. White-knuckled people jammed their fingers into my desktop, explaining why they were good but needed to be, or at least appear to be even better. Their jobs, like mine, having kidnapped their souls and – with promotions and raises, prevented them escaping their own cubicles. Mornings on the beach I began to see I didn’t just service my clients, I was my clients.
Physically, I’d been in this Professional Resume Writing cubicle for ten years. Metaphorically, I’d been in a cubicle called My Life for a half-century. I felt the need to step out of both. Completely out. I wanted to immerse myself in something, an original conceptual experience that was new and different. Even just dig a really, really big hole (which I did; I’ll get to that). And, unlike my life up to this point, I wanted it to be something I planned, performed, controlled, and was victorious in carrying out or, if I failed, understand why and take ownership of that failure. I would still have to react to problems that might present themselves, but at least I’d understand the circumstances that brought me there. Stepping out of my rut wouldn’t necessarily be tossing fate to the wind. Ironically, I was already doing just that in my so-called regimented daily life.
As an adult I no longer had parents or teachers to push me to take this new action, whatever it might be. Self-employed, I didn’t have superiors to motivate me with possible rewards. I had to take the initiative.
One morning on the beach, after weeks of walking the shoreline and marveling at all the previously mentioned external stimuli and parts of my own still-elusive identity, I experienced a game-changing psycho-intellectual event. I realized this lake was more than a physical body of water larger than some of the so-called seas in Eastern Europe and Asia; it was a metaphor for my life. Here it was, so big and right under my nose, and had been my entire life (I grew up here), yet, like my life, I’d never paid much attention to it. I knew it not.
I couldn’t turn the clock back to when I was a child and first saw Ontario and beheld it with curiosity and mild wonderment. No, but I decided that morning I would walk around the lake. By paying total attention to this body of water previously ignored on my part, like my own life, I could at least make the present stand still, figuratively, for the time it might take me to compass the lake. I could disassemble my daily cerebral routine. Paying attention to the lake in this new way I might learn to do the same with myself. If I learned the lake I might get closer to learning myself.
I would engage in only the essentials of daily living. I would reduce daily life to its simplest form. If it proved to be tough, I would embrace and fight the toughness on my own terms.
I would totally jam this literal and metaphorical lake, uncluttered by peripheral phenomena. Jam it in my face, from sunup to sundown. Almost forcing down my own throat something that had been right in my face nearly my entire life but which I’d never really tasted. This would not be trekking the Appalachian Trail or climbing Mount Everest. This was actually the point; nothing exotic or far away. Not even a recognized undertaking, but as up close and down to earth as walking around my own personal backyard whose footprint happened to be seven thousand square miles.
Circling the lake on foot would be something I could control; a task I could design, plan, and execute with no outside input or interference – positive or negative; not a soft couch luring me in front of a television, or an unhappy wife driving me out.
I’d know what I was doing, how I was doing it, and why. I’d be plunged into the physicality of it. I could feel and listen to the here-and-now of it with each step.
Nowhere could I find evidence of anyone else having done this – walked around this lake. There would, therefore, be no barometer against which to judge my performance. I would create The Template for Walking around Great Lake Ontario.
I would walk it in one fell swoop. On Day One I’d leave from my front door, that staid white portal, and not stop for 360 degrees – except to eat and sleep – until I returned to that entryway with its familiar brass doorknob and my address – 137, emblazoned on it. I would see just how much I could get out of myself. I would prove myself to myself. Maybe that was a conciliatory way of saying, “To see how much I could punish myself for not paying attention to anything for fifty-two years.”
I prepared religiously. I was self-employed. I didn’t get paid vacations. I needed to save money – for expenses on the road and for the three or four weeks away from work without income. In addition to my morning strolls at the beach, I walked regularly and more vigorously at the Cobb’s Hill Reservoir to get into shape. By the time I set out, at age fifty-two, I was almost as physically fit as I’d been in my twenties. Over the course of three years – from the last day of Living with Laura, to Ontario Trek Departure Day, I dropped from about 215 to 165 pounds, although shedding three bowling balls worth of weight from my 5-foot 9½-inch frame was an unplanned and purely incidental byproduct of this undertaking.
I believed that for me the best way to tackle 565 miles on foot was full steam ahead. Marathon mentality. Do the miles; the stepping, not the resting. As you will see, most days I was something like a cross between Santa Claus running late on Christmas Eve, and Lewis & Clarke paddling upstream. I was married to this walk. It would be no honeymoon; rather an extremely demanding partnership of desiring and accomplishing.
My compassing of Lake Ontario occurred just prior to cell phones being capable of taking pictures. I carried a high-end German-Japanese hybrid camera called None. I decided to carry no camera, initially, because of a weight issue. However, once on the road I soon realized that to walk from dawn to dusk, under an unforgiving sun, carrying a thirty-pound pack and nursing knees and ankles threatening mutiny – then to stop and take a picture of something – anything would have been to trivialize why I was there in the first place. It would be to ignore the fact my hands were often trembling from fatigue or too sweaty to take pictures. I didn’t realize until after the trek that meeting new people and getting to know them was part of what I was trying to get away from. That was all I did, every day: answered the phone, explained my resume writing service, scheduled appointments, interviewed clients, and processed and formatted their information. I was overloaded with other people and their stories. Had I brought a camera, there likely would not have been photos of me shaking hands with the Afghan refugees who put me up in Toronto, or a photo of me posing with the Phi Lambda Phi sisters who took me in for a night at SUNY Oswego.
To do so would have done an injustice to the one thousand other moments, real and internal, that got me to Toronto and to the sorority house but are not discernable in a two-dimensional photograph. And I was so focused on my physical and mental journey I didn’t bond enough with most people along the way wherein a photo of me posing with them would have more significance than the individual steps it took me to get there.

Turning the Pages
As you will see, I walked through farmland, orchards, suburbs, cities (including Toronto) a family picnic, a trailer park, and a college town. I meandered unhampered along isolated cottage lanes and elbowed my way through bustling urban waterfronts.
I attacked this trek as I would a marathon. I set out to walk, not talk. Or take photos. Or meet people, although I did meet some interesting folks along the way. I wanted to see what I could get out of myself, physically and mentally. I walked from dawn ‘til dusk. With breaks for meals and brief mid-afternoon hideouts from the sun. On a good day I could average three miles-an-hour. This is carrying a loaded backpack, under an ever-present sun (except for the two times that it briefly rained). My stride is 31 inches, which works out to just over two thousand steps per mile. In eight real hours of walking I laid down fifty thousand steps, covering about twenty-four miles each day.
That was the physical trek.
In addition to the many new-to-me geographic points of interest I passed through in the State of New York and the Province of Ontario, I encountered previously uncharted interior places.
You could say I woke up every morning to a new city, a city located in the afore-mentioned six inches of gray matter. Maybe my hotel room didn’t have floor-to-ceiling windows with breathtaking views of skyscrapers and a harbor beyond. Maybe I didn’t even have a hotel room. Maybe I woke to the cold and clammy roof of my tent – soaked with water vapor from my breath, smushed against my face. But it was a new day. And I’d gotten the previous day behind me, and the one before that, like I promised myself I would.
Most of the interior places I encountered were direct responses to physical events. Like an injured ankle on Day Four – a perfect reason to abandon the trek; a near assault on the Toronto waterfront on Day Ten.
Many days the exterior event was “no event,” meaning just grinding out the miles, from Day One, for five-hundred-sixty-five miles, all the way back to the starting line on Day Twenty-Four, while pretending my blisters weren’t infected and my toenails weren’t falling off.
As important as what I was doing – the trek – was what I was not doing: for the first time in nearly ten years, I was not sitting in a cubicle for five, sometimes six days a week and processing information – mostly other people’s.
On foot, my mind wandered freely. Some days I was the Reflecting King. I might replay conversations I had or create dialogues I should have had; a song I liked or one I hated. I composed emails I should write. I turned back those times I should not have hit “send.” I outlined letters to editors – local in tone as well as speeches to the world on topics of utmost importance, to me, anyway. I framed and re-framed what I really should have said in response to her that day three years ago in the driveway.
I pushed myself for twenty-four days, averaging what turned out to be twenty-four miles a day, in the July heat, dodging a sea of cars (I once thought Canada was all woods) whose windshields blinded me from one direction like the sun it reflected coming from the other direction. This all took a significant physical toll, requiring a focused and committed mental state, while other times it delivered up a spiritual peacefulness. However it might go, at the end of each day, my disparate parties did not divorce, but shook hands and were able to sleep together in harmony.
Mornings, neither an alarm clock nor starting gun was necessary. I generally woke before dawn to my own personal “WALK/DON’T WALK” sign and “WALK” was flashing. “Morning” became a verb.
There were few days I didn’t experience some degree of confusion or self-doubt. Can I continue? Should I? Why again am I doing this? Imagine the thoughts you might be having halfway through your first marathon Why should I keep going? No one in the world cares except me. But self-doubt collided constantly with, and was ultimately overruled by my need, nay, fixation to keep moving forward. “Me” is why I’m doing this.
There were five distinct times – three in Canada and two in New York, where a member of the fairer sex wanted to engage herself – in one capacity or another, in what I was doing.
I declined. And it was doubly painful. Both the moment I effused my “Thanks, but no thanks,” and then the lingering thoughts I had to carry with me about what could have been. But like photographs, I was not out here to capture or interact with other forms of art.
At the end of each day, hand-scrawled entries in my own handwriting miraculously appeared on the pages of my journal. These were in pencil; a ballpoint pen could not have survived the heat from the sun and the ink could not have cut through my sweat on the pages. I sharpened my pencil by scraping it against brick or concrete walls, bridge abutments or highway drainage culverts; yeah, I sat on the ground more than a couple times. In the beginning of my trek, I carefully thumb nailed my days and thoughts. My capacity for journaling, however, slowly deteriorated by the day. The evening entries, in Canadian and US-sharpened Number 2 lead became shorter and more fragmented. By Day Twenty-something, what might represent the last miles if one were actually running a twenty-six-mile marathon were disjointed and incomplete sentences.
When I found my old diaries, those notes, however crudely scrawled, pulled me back magically to the day-to-day of that trek on foot. My recall was vivid enough to enable me to expand on the notes – fill in the blanks, the invisible steps that seemed to be still waiting for me to take. And so, with the aid of a keyboard and a comfortable chair, I’ve herein transcribed my impromptu insights into complete sentences and paragraphs.             
I hope you’ll enjoy my voyage on foot in the comfort of your own chair.
CUTTING THE CORD
July 4, 1997
It’s Friday, the Fourth of July – Independence Day. A date commemorating the formal declaration of a group of people whose intent was to pursue freedom from colonial rule and form a nation that would be called the United States of America. A war would ensue, the group would eventually win independence, and as a result, today, most Americans are free to do as they choose. The choice I’ve made for this Fourth is to commence my walk around Lake Ontario; this to be Day One of the trek. I’ve spent much time planning and preparing for it, almost obsessively.
Last night before going to bed I ran through my check list. I have coverage at work. A writer friend, Chuck, is going to take care of my resume-writing business for me while I’m gone. I have my budget figured out. I’ve mapped the route in my truck – most of it, anyway. I’m in total shape. Gear packed? Check! Cash? Check! Phone? Charger? Check! List of phone numbers? Check! Check list? Check! At bedtime everything was going great, as planned. I had my ducks in a row. That was last night.
Now it’s morning and I’m awake two hours before departure time. As I stand in the bathroom, my face just inches from the wall – doing what most fifty-something men do when they first rise – I become cognizant of the fact that although my stars may be lined up and my logistics settled, something is amiss.
Now it’s less than an hour to launch time, and I’m feeling hesitant about stepping, literally, out of my comfort zone. My usual morning bagel and coffee followed by a walk at the beach or the reservoir and my day at the office – the complacent routine to be escaped by embarking on this trek – is suddenly starting to take on Main Purpose in Life proportions, to be clutched to my breast.
Am I really going to walk away from this? After my excitement over conceiving this trek and immersing myself in my own little world of planning and preparation, I now must leave that very world of tasks, lists, diet management, mapping, and checking off each accomplishment, and go out there into an unknown world in order to give purpose to it all.
Instead of taking comfort in having slowly and steadily worked up to this moment for over two years, I now feel that to walk out the door, however appropriately shod, could be as traumatic as walking on hot coals in my bare feet.
I consider alternative activities I might be involved in this weekend – what I’ve done on past July Fourths – picnics with family and friends, fireworks, too many hotdogs. How did “Setting out alone on a 565-mile walk” make it onto my Fourth of July single-item Bucket List?
A light rain is falling; the temperature is 55 degrees. July, in Rochester, is normally 80-something and sunny. I’m standing at my living room window looking across Culver Road at the muddy, deserted softball diamond at Cobb's Hill Park. The little space around each base, where the most foot traffic in a game typically occurs, is flooded. Ironically home plate and first base seem the worst.
I take the gear back out of my backpack – all of it, one item at a time, lay it on the floor and re-check it again. It’s all there. Now, with just minutes to go, I don’t re-pack it. I count my cash again and lay it on the table. I double-check my emergency phone numbers and set the sheet of paper back down on the table instead of re-folding it. I get my checkbook and again make sure I’ve paid my gas and electric bill. I review my six-page typed list of 350 Safe Havens and general landmarks I mapped out in my truck, in late May. Some are significant: county lines; the Niagara River. Some are only idle entries to give me the feeling of achieving milestones: “tilted mobile home,” “broken statue,” “picturesque cove w/ moored sailboats,” “rickety wooden bridge over RR tracks.”
Years ago, when my children were little they lived with their mom in Springwater – forty miles from me, here, in Rochester and I used to pick them up on Fridays for the weekend. I created a document to help them pass the time during the ride back so they could see we were making progress.
It was a map with the halfway and the one-quarter ways marked off along with familiar landmarks sketched in – the sand quarry my three-year-old son liked to play in, the dark gray house that never had any lights on and my eight-year-old daughter was certain was haunted, the hotel bar with the old neon sign with missing paint that read, “TAR ROOM” not “TAP ROOM.” Right now, I’m feeling like a child getting ready for a long trip and I don’t have my daddy to make it happen.
I won’t realize until I’m out on the road that this list of Safe Havens will become my pacifier. More than something I constantly pull out to confirm where I am. As tattered as it will become, it will be tangible proof in my hands that I still have the living room and computer back home wherein and on which I created this document, leisurely, over the course of a few evenings. With wine and cheese, the late sun coming in the window and music on the stereo. And not a clue about what the walk will actually hand me. Right now, in my living room the Safe Havens are still just words – names of places and things. Once the deep-pile carpeting is out from under my feet and I’m doing my business where the birds and animals do theirs, this six-page document will become my thumb-sucking blanky, my connection back to the security of my carpeted living womb. But, then, this is all the more reason I should be out there walking.
As I peruse my list, I recall seeing and recording many of the entries but begin to feel unease when I come to one of which I have no recollection. Perhaps it’s not there at all. Perhaps Canada and the entire northern coast of the lake are not really there, which would give me reason to stay put, here in my living room.
Because I planned all this alone, I’ve no one off of whom to bounce affirmations. There is no clear context. Next to getting married, which I had reservations about – both times – this is the biggest thing I’ve ever planned and undertaken by choice. In marriage, I had encouragement from my partners in crime. This time I’m on my own. About to tie the knots on my walking shoes, I’m realizing now, that in preparing for this trek, I got lost in the details and overlooked the big picture.
My send-off party is surely waiting for me to call them. They aren’t typical – wife, kids, or a group from the office. I work alone. I have no wife.
Children in their late teens and early twenties have little interest in what their parents are doing unless it somehow significantly impacts what they, themselves, are doing. My daughter and son are very likely sleeping in; she, just down the street in the house she shares with three other young women; he – also with roommates, in an apartment just across the street from the SUNY College campus in Brockport. The uniqueness of my send-off party is on par with the task at hand. They are Scotty, who’s an old girlfriend from high school, her Afghan husband, Seed, and Scotty’s octogenarian mother, Dot.
10:00 a.m.
Starting out means taking the first step, which means getting to the shore of Ontario. I make the call, more because they are expecting it, less because I’m confident I can do what I’ve been proclaiming for two years I would do. Fifteen minutes later, when Scotty and crew pull up in front of my house I see four heads – not three, in the car. Turns out they’ve brought another Afghan, Seed’s cousin, Muhd.
I know this seven-mile stretch of expressway from my house to my starting point intimately, having driven it easily two hundred mornings over the past two years on my way to walk the Lake Ontario beach and experience the sunrise. On those days, I tremored with anticipation as I approached the lake. Today, uncertainty. I feel as if one end of a very long rubber band is attached to me, the other to the front doorknob of my house.
Everyone in the car but me is talking: What is that, Farsi? Urdu? Pashto? Okay, back to English. Scotty headed a relief organization in Pakistan, just over the border from Afghanistan, which is where she met Seed who, back then was fighting the Russian invaders in Afghanistan. They lived there for ten years before being driven out by a new enemy, the Taliban. The true common bond these people have is not transporting me to my walk, but their shared history in that politically, economically, and socially fraught country. Yet another of Seed’s cousins, Shamahmood, in Toronto, is going to put me up for a night – if I make it that far.
Not many Fourth of July's ago, I was barely aware of the existence of Afghanistan. I recall another personal adventure, a famous one, commenced on yet another Fourth of July. It did not, however, cover great geographical distances.
Henry David Thoreau, one of the adventurers whose writings helped me persevere in my preparation for my trek, commenced his Walden hermitage on July 4, 1845. Afghanistan did not then exist as a recognized country.
Halfway to the starting point Scotty discovers the cell phone they’re lending me doesn’t work. Does this mean no trek? In less time than it takes to drive the remaining four miles, she gets AT&T Customer Service on her other phone, Yes, on Saturday the Fourth of July, and the technical issue is resolved by the time we arrive at our destination.
We reach the parking lot where the Irondequoit Bay Outlet flows into Lake Ontario. I wonder what Seed thinks of my venture: me, an aging westerner having to contrive a reason to walk a long distance. He spent eight years of his life, from age thirteen to twenty-one, as a Freedom Fighter – one of the Mujahideen – walking through the wilderness of Afghanistan, under the Pro-Western, anti-Taliban guerilla leader Massoud, the so-called Lion of the Panjshir. Armed with AK-47s, in snow, wind, rain, and sun, they strove to drive out the Russians. The Mujahideen carried everything they owned on their backs, including the knowledge they might not have a home, or even a country to come back to. Seed’s cousin, Muhd, the guy sitting next to me in the back seat, was a pre-Taliban vice president of Afghanistan (Wow, I’m traveling in high circles!) and, prior, Afghan ambassador to Japan. His former power core, Afghanistan, has over time completely deteriorated with its largest export now being refugees. Here he is this morning, halfway around the world from that core, that country, with no apparent game plan, sitting next to a man – me – who has to go out of his way to find something representing an upheaval in his own life.
Colin Fletcher’s The Man Who Walked through Time, is a definitive backpacking book of the 1960s. Fletcher describes preparing to embark on his trek through the Grand Canyon, an extreme geographical zig-zag and psychological meander that would take him two months to cover forty-three miles as the crow flies. He also found himself floundering on departure day. His, too, was a journey for which he’d prepared in the most detailed, almost anal fashion. He talks about the emptiness of zero hour:
“It is…this emptiness, at the threshold of a journey that will start something.”
I, too, am feeling this. I felt it another time, long ago, on a wedding day. This phenomenon, Fletcher continues:
“…seems to encircle you with a huge, transparent, plastic balloon (that) cuts off the reality of the outside world. It obliterates your ambitions, cancels the very reason for your journey. You know that before long you will once more feel and understand and hope. But at the time there is only the emptiness.”
Then, referring to the man who dropped him off at his starting point, Fletcher says:
“…although I was listening to Lorenzo, his words were mere words. For Lorenzo… existed only thinly, in that emptiness.”
This morning Muhd, former Afghan VP, is my Lorenzo. He stands next to me, now in the parking lot, both of us in a unifying light rain, but he’s outside my “balloon.” Since fleeing Afghanistan as a political refugee, he has lived in at least two other “-istan” countries and in France. He speaks Farsi, Japanese, French, and flawless English, but I speak slowly to him and use arm gestures as I ostensibly explain to him how I’m going to walk around the lake, when I’m actually trying to explain it to myself.
Fishermen are parked in a row, side-by-side in their pickup trucks, facing us, their boat trailers stretched out behind them, their engines idling and windshield wipers swishing intermittently, waiting for the rain to stop. The closest truck looks to be a father and young son. They watch us. I’m wearing my backpack, pointing to the horizon and drawing a picture with my arm of walking around the lake, ""…about one hundred miles west from here along the southern shore...then across the Niagara River into Canada...then around the west end of the lake, and back east along the northern shore to Toronto..."" The onlookers must know what I’m depicting. I’m making a public promise I’m not sure I can keep.
Muhd will shortly depart here to find his place in the international world. I’ll be leaving here to follow the shoreline of Lake Ontario, exploring my place in the inner world of Me. Those fishermen watching us seem already comfortably anchored and content with themselves in their particular place in the world.
Anyone can stand anywhere and say they’re going to do something. Someone – I, must now do it. I take four or five steps down the sloping bank strewn with basketball-size boulders and stick my toe in the water of the outlet channel to christen my shoe and signify my official start. Eighty-three-year-old Dot captures this on camera.
There’s now nothing left for me to do but take the first westward step.
DAY 1: STARTING GUN!
11:00 a.m.
I climb back up the bank from the water’s edge of the Irondequoit Bay Outlet, say goodbye to my send-off party, and start walking west. It’s not exactly like the start of a marathon, or even a 10K race, the latter of which I’ve run several. No race official raises a .22 starter pistol and fires it, while another trips the timing device. No crowd is cheering and no fellow contenders are trying to elbow their way ahead of me. In fact, I remind myself, this isn’t even a recognized sport. I cross one parking space, then four more steps, another space…
I’m barely a hundred steps out of the parking lot, on Culver Road, when I come abreast of Seabreeze Amusement Park. I experience a funny pang. This has been “The” amusement park in Rochester for generations. I've been here many times in my life: as an antsy child with my parents, wanting to ride the merry-go-round; as a teenager with the top down, radio blasting and the smell of cotton candy wafting in the air; then in a sedan with excited little kids in the back seat; again, with no kids; now alone, on foot. The park is not yet open for the day. The formidable Jack Rabbit roller coaster towers above the neighborhood rooftops, silent in the light morning rain.
I pick my way along the rough shoulder of the road, veering in to avoid oncoming traffic. Indeed, these first steps do not feel at all like charging away from the starting line, chest out. Walking away from the present, almost immediately confronting a chunk of my past, I feel like I’m not even going forward, but backward. To further drive home this sensation, Scotty and her Afghan-American troupe, who’ve chosen to return home via my route, versus the expressway, suddenly come from behind, cruising past me at 35 miles-per-hour, honking and waving. Figuring I’m making about three-miles-per-hour, weighed against their forward momentum, I’m not only traveling backward in time, but at that moment losing 32 miles-per-hour as well.
I reach for my water bottle to give myself a toast of encouragement. It’s not here; I left it home, on the kitchen counter. My stoned wheat thins, too, even after all that ridiculous re-checking of my gear. I stop at a convenience store and buy saltine crackers and a bottle of water.
The road cuts temporarily away from the lake and through Durand-Eastman Park. On a park bench I pack the crackers and water. Graffiti is scrawled on the bench, the freshest and most legible being, ""The South shall rise again, damb it!"" This lightens my spirits, knowing there’s at least one other human in his own little world who is trying to get all his ducks libed up.
Back on the lakefront road, I come abreast of Durand Beach, my old friend – my reflective beach walking haven-turned-psychological launching pad for this trek. I scan the shoreline to see if there’s anyone walking alone, pensive, perhaps trying to find him or herself. I don’t see anyone. I’m momentarily tempted to walk the beach, which parallels the road for a mile. Then I realize, during those mornings at the beach I envisioned this walk, this very action of passing the beach on foot. I cannot walk on the beach right now. I’m in my own future. I remain on the road.
2:00 p.m.
Traffic is heavy: cars, vans, SUVs, and motorcycles. There seem to be four dimensions holding the world together, the three spatial dimensions and, the fourth – the sound and feel of traffic. Constant humming of tires on pavement and the almost invasive “swish” of vehicles as they pass me. When there’s no traffic for a few moments, I feel like I’ve lost a reference point and might tip over in the unbalance of the calm.
A couple cars honk and the people wave, but I don’t know them. Maybe they’re honking because it’s the Fourth of July and I look like I’m celebrating America. 
I’ve walked through the waterfront settlement of Charlotte. The rain has stopped. I take a break, sitting on some rocks where Slater Creek empties into the lake. Here it is, summertime, and I have my windbreaker on and hood up. I’m sitting next to 7,500 square miles of water, drinking bottled water for which I paid $1.50.
I have two pairs of wet socks draped over rocks to dry out. I washed them earlier in the morning but, with only two years of foresight, didn't allow enough time to dry them. This brings to mind my clothes dryer and washer, which brings to mind my laundry room and my apartment. I look at my watch; it’s 2:05 p.m. I do some calculating. Even though I was transported  about eight miles straight north from my house in a car and have now walked several miles straight west, I can scrub this whole mission and, by walking the hypotenuse of these two perpendicular lines, be back home before dark. 
I recall a parallel situation of another adventurer whose tale I read: Captain Joshua Slocum, the first person to sail solo around the world (1895 to 1898). Slocum prepared painstakingly for his intended global circumnavigation. Over thirteen months he re-built an old sailboat, announced his voyage to the 19th century media, and got his affairs in order with his wife and children. On his day of departure, he sailed out of the harbor in Gloucester, Massachusetts, toward the Atlantic Ocean. Along the shore locals waved to him with their handkerchiefs. Weather conditions were ideal as he headed out to sea. In order to reach the open ocean, he had to pass two points, Cashes Ledge and the Amen Rocks.
Here, on his way to what would be making world history, Captain Slocum writes in his journal:
“I…considered the matter all over again, and asked myself once more whether it       were best to sail beyond the ledge and rocks at all.”            
We continue, the Captain and I.
The road detours due to impassable bays and backwaters and becomes Lowden Point Road. I’m now walking directly away from the lake. This didn’t matter when I was mapping the route in my pickup at 40 miles-per-hour. Now it feels a bit incongruous. I follow the road up and over the Lake Ontario State Parkway. I duck into an apple orchard and sit, invisible among the low-hanging tree branches, eating the lunch I packed. I don’t know if I’m legal or illegal in here; fulfilling a dream or trespassing. Through openings in the leaves I watch cars fly past on the parkway. I wonder if I should be hiding from them. Part of me feels like jumping up and down and waving. Normally, eating lunch when I’m working, waitresses in two different diners know I take my coffee black. Here, I myself am not sure how I fit and I have no coffee.
As I continue walking farther south along Lowden Point Road, I see a couple in their yard; he’s washing the car, she’s trimming shrubs by their front door. I pass another house with another domesticating couple. I’m only a few hours into honing my new ambulating self yet I feel, with my backpack rather than a lawn to mow or car to wash, very apart from these normal people. Improperly “dressed.” Here on Lowden Point Road my odd solo walk is juxtaposed against this normal duo stuff that I am now realizing I perhaps value more than I’ve realized. Not only don’t I have a partner, I don’t even have a place to live right now. No “den.” I am crossing out the “den” on Lowden Point Road on my list of Safe Havens, so it is now simply Low Point Road.
6:00 p.m.
As I’m walking west on Route 261, or Frisbee Hill Road, the exterior aluminum frame of my backpack comes apart but I’m able to fix it with my multi-tool. According to my pedometer, I’ve walked sixteen-and-a-half miles. I don't want to overdo it, especially on the first day, yet there’s nothing to do but walk. The rain has resumed, this time with a bit of wind. Having walked off much of my body fat over the past two years I no longer have a lot of natural insulation. I can take cover under trees, stand still, and quickly find myself shivering with cold, or I can walk, get a little wet, but make progress and generate body heat. I walk.
The rain has stopped again by the time I reach the main intersection in the village of Hilton. At a gas station old coffee smoldering on a hotplate gives new meaning to, “I’ll take it black.” I buy a cup and sit on a bench in front of the Town Library. I check my list of Safe Havens. Two potential campsites are coming up: a cemetery in four miles and, in six, I’ve noted a “Cluster of trees with no ‘Posted’ signs.” I want to make it to one of these before dark, so I’m back on my feet as I take the last swirl of coffee from my cup.
7:30 p.m.
In four miles the cemetery comes into view. It looks inviting. Perhaps I should stop and make camp. But it’s not really close enough to nightfall yet. The decision is made for me: a deputy sheriff’s car approaches from behind me and slows. I imagine he’s studying me, trying to figure out just how many more miles I'll walk before I try to camp illegally on someone's private property. I try to effuse innocence as I continue past the cemetery.
According to my list, a convenience store is supposed to be coming up. The city and the suburbs are behind me, now. This is a wooded, more rural area, not the kind of place one would expect to find a store. Maybe I made a mistake when I mapped this out. If there is a store, it should have appeared by now. Just as I’m beginning to seriously question the accuracy of my six pages of checkpoints, I see the edge of a sign protruding from the trees ahead. Slowly, leaf by leaf, the sign – then the store – comes into view. I wonder if I'll be able to talk them into selling me just a single beer. Maybe they’ll be busy and won’t worry about breaking up a six-pack. But, as more leaves peel away, I see they’re not busy. There’s just one car in the parking lot, that of the deputy sheriff. I don't want to go in there and call attention to myself, but I've been imagining a cold beer for miles and, having depleted my water, I’m thirsty. I remove my backpack at the front door, draw in a breath of courage, and walk in. 
My stage entrance goes almost unnoticed. Behind the counter, are a teenage boy and girl cashiers. Over in a far corner, my most feared audience, the deputy and what appears to be the store manager, are having a heated exchange. The deputy is threatening to arrest him. The deputy apparently has spoken to him previously about what sounds like an issue involving an order of protection. He’s giving him a last warning. This confrontation takes me out of the spotlight and, I can see, embarrasses the two teens. They avoid eye contact with me. When I break open a six-pack in the cooler and approach the cash register, they quickly ring up the one beer rather than interrupt the deputy and ask the manager if it’s okay to sell a single beer taken from a six-pack, or how much to charge for it. Smiling with victory, I stick the ice-cold can in my backpack and continue west. The officer of the law, whom I earlier perceived as threatening, has unknowingly aided and abetted me.
Safe Haven
I look through the dusk in both directions to make sure no cars are coming then duck into that cluster of trees without any posted signs, alongside a farm lane just inside the Hamlin town line. Once in my tent, I unroll my sleeping bag, which Scotty lent me, and I discover two bed sheets inside. I fold them into a pillow and in so doing realize they are made of quality material and weigh probably a pound.
Considering I take about two thousand steps per mile, and the trip will top five hundred miles – equal to easily one million steps – this extra weight extrapolates to one million step-pounds, a weight-distance metric I just concocted. I decide I’ll leave the sheets behind in the morning and come back next month in my truck to pick them up.
I open the beer and, in what little light remains, pull out my list of names and phone numbers. Shamahmood is the Afghan man who’ll put me up for a night if, I mean when, I get to Toronto. I practice saying his name so I can fire it off naturally when we meet. His multi-syllabic name is a mouthful for me. I’ve got his first name, down pat. The spelling and rhythm are similar to Sha-Na-Na. I really need to work on that surname, though, which is composed of letters as unpronounceable to me as if they were drawn randomly from a jar. 
Sipping a cold beer and having walked significantly farther than I anticipated, I’m feeling as smug as maybe Thoreau felt when he spent his first night in his newly constructed cabin on Walden Pond.
Ah, but what the hell is this?! A tractor starts up. It’s very close by. I listen, shaking slightly from exhaustion and now, apprehension, trying to figure out if it’s moving toward me in my hideout. I don't dare poke my head out of the tent. Instinctively I lie lower, as if – inside my tent – ducking down will make me any less visible. I start composing excuses for why I’m camped here, in this farmer's woods. “I’m sorry, I didn’t think of it as trespassing.” Or maybe I’ll offer to pay him or her to let me stay here. The tractor continues running, doing I-don’t-know-what, since night has fallen. I repeat Shamahmood's name over-and-over like a prayer that I won’t be discovered. The tractor clunks into gear and starts moving, not closer to me, it turns out, but in another direction. My prayer is answered but, in the darkness, I knock over my still half-full beer on my sleeping bag and tent floor. Not only do I have to sleep in my own sweat, but now sticky beer as well.
Day’s expenses: $3.85 for crackers and bottled water, $1.13 for beer. Make that half-a-beer.
Distance covered this first day on the road: twenty-two miles, in spite of my not starting until late morning. I originally estimated I’d cover eighteen miles in a full day!
DAY 2: SHADOWS AND BODIES
July 5, 1997 – 7:00 a.m.
I wake to a clear, rural morning. I’m fired up about having covered twenty-two miles yesterday in only about eight hours. I break camp and, still standing in the clump of trees, listen for cars. Hearing none, I walk quickly through the uncut and dewy shin-deep clover and timothy grass, back out to the two-lane country road, Route 18, and head west. 
Shortly after, I come to a cluster of buildings at a flashing four-way stoplight, spot the Hamlin Family Diner, and walk in. Senior men wearing shirts and caps bearing logos for tractors and chainsaws smoke cigarettes and talk aloud, between tables. The sole waitress, a smiling and outgoing middle-aged woman, visits each table, even sits down and smokes for a moment with the men. They call her Shadow, an unlikely name for such a bright persona. When she brings my food, I ask if this is really her name. She laughs and says it’s a mispronunciation, by the Greek cook, of her real name, Sheryl. His heavy accent turns her “r” into a “d” every time he calls out that her order is ready. While she may be a shadow, I seem completely invisible to these locals who are all about farming, logging, and prompt coffee refills.
9:15 a.m.
Back on the road, with food for thought, I write in my journal:
Shadow: A cheerful waitress, the perfect person to be the first I encounter in my day. I can see why the men might dine there even if they charged for refills.
Shadow: Meteorologically, my shadow is exactly as long as I am tall. Geographically, I’m walking into Orleans County. Psychologically, a mile is becoming a mere page in a book whose cover I was initially skeptical about, but in which I'm slowly becoming immersed.

I spot a round silver object on the road with a red maple leaf on it like the one on the Canadian flag. In spite of the weight of my backpack and the potential strain on my knees, I slowly crouch to pick it up, thinking it’s a cameo or pin, only to discover it’s just a beer cap, and a crushed one at that. In spite of the joke this piece of highway litter has played on me, I don’t want to throw it away, it’s part of “success in progress.” In my pocket, it’s now my official good luck piece for this trek. 
10:00 a.m.
I stop at the Kendall Cemetery and spread out my gear to dry out a bit from yesterday’s rain and last night’s beer. When I anticipated covering only eighteen miles a day, I marked this cemetery as a place where I might sleep tonight, at the end of my second day; however, I’ve already made it here by late morning. I double check my pedometer measurements against the distance increments on my list of Safe Havens. I’m accurate to within a tenth-of-a-mile in error over twenty-two miles.
Wildlife: lots of wildlife. Goldfinches, chirping sparrows and an indigo bunting flashing iridescent blue in the sunlight.
Wild Life: my backpack smells like beer.
Dead Life: a lot of it flattened along the road. This is a low, wet area and the road is littered with road kill – mostly dead frogs, along with an occasional turtle or snake. The flattened frogs, with their exaggerated fingers and wide frowning mouths, have the most humanistic last-moment-of-life-before-I-got-run-over-by-a-car expressions; many different personifications of “Oh shit!”
Good Life: I buy coffee at a farm market run by an initially aloof woman who’s about my age. It’s just the two of us in a quiet and rather confined space. At first she seems anxious for me to finish my coffee and take leave. After I explain my trip and show her my list of Safe Havens she probably sees me as an overgrown Boy Scout. She gives me a free refill, sits down at the picnic table, and shares a cup with me.
I write postcards to my kids and to Annette, a waitress at the Charbroil Family Restaurant across the street from my resume office, where I regularly eat lunch. I sketch cartoons of flattened frogs’ facial expressions as supporting graphics.
People’s curiosity seems piqued when they drive past me and see I’m on foot. Hmmm, backpack… However, when I actually walk into someone’s space, like their farm market or their store, where they’re not safe behind the wheel of a car and they look up and see me, they seem a bit leery because of that very backpack. I can actually see their shoulders slope back downward when I pull out my clear Ziploc freezer bag with map, postage stamps, pen, and neatly folded cash. My little stash provides context. Their trepidation seems to de-escalate: This guy’s too anal to pose a threat. And he won’t panhandle me because he has folding money and I’m guessing all those bills are lined up facing the same way. Could be. To me, the Ziploc is my virtual glove compartment, my office, and in some cases my ambassador.
Back along the lake, now, I’m approaching the village of Lakeside, but – what’s this? – the road is closed. At some point since I came through here and mapped this route just a few weeks ago, a highway barrier has been erected across the entrance to my road. It bears a sign: “Bridge Closed – Local Traffic Only.” I can see the bridge a few hundred yards down the road, barricaded with a pile of orange sandbags. I can take another road, slightly longer in distance but, I reason, because I’m on foot I can cross a bridge that’s closed to cars, of which there are none in sight, and this is a holiday weekend so there surely won’t be any workers around. As I approach the bridge I now see just before it, tucked behind a hillock and down by the water – so it’s out of sight from the “bridge closed” sign, a motel. I buy a coke from the machine outside the office. A woman comes out and I ask her when they closed the bridge.
“They just closed it three days ago’” she says. “They’re going to repair it. It’s supposed to take two months.”
Even though it’s only mid-afternoon I’ve made a good distance already. An idea strikes me: they are probably desperate for business because no cars will be coming down this road.
“Would you let me have a room for forty dollars?”
“The rooms are fifty-eight dollars,” she says.
I already saw the price posted in the window. She apparently doesn’t get it yet; she’s going to have no business. The parking lot is empty of cars. There’s a sign at the entrance to the road that says, “Local Traffic Only.”
No one will be driving down this road and happen upon this motel – probably for the duration of the summer, unless they already know it’s here. I don’t want to be pushy, so I drop the subject and head off. I walk around the sandbags and right down the exact middle of the bridge over the Oak Orchard River.
6:00 p.m.
Safe Haven
I’ve reached Lakeside State Park, a public campground right on the lake. I rent what turns out to be the last available campsite. The campground is huge and I have to walk almost a mile back east, in the direction from which I’ve just come, to claim my campsite. It’s a non-descript treeless site with an odd, crooked tree stump the size of a baseball bat projecting from the ground. A slight feeling of Deja vu comes over me but I’m distracted from this puzzlement by the fact there’s no picnic table. A table is part of the campsite package. Now I see the next-door campers have two tables but they aren't around. The normalcy factor in having a solid seat to sit on and a table on which to lay out my map to plot tomorrow's distance is one of the reasons I paid for a campsite instead of camping freelance. I put up my tent and go to the bathhouse to take a shower. When I return, parts of me still dripping wet (I didn’t pack a towel for weight consideration), my neighbors are back. I ask them if that’s my table and their two teenage sons bring it over with apologies. I find humor in the fact that this massive log table is bigger than my tiny pup tent, my home on the road, sitting next to it.
I write in my journal:
I never thought automobile traffic would comprise such a significant element of this outing. The traffic tears by all day long, non-stop. The land is flat here, along the south shore of the lake. For example, today I spotted a white barn far up ahead of me. I paced the distance and found it to be one-and-one-half miles. As I gradually learn the sound an approaching car makes at a distance, I can hear them coming from further and further away. Having never walked down a road this long and flat I did not know what pitch to listen for. At first, I didn’t hear an approaching car until it was half-a-dozen telephone poles away; then a couple football fields.
Finally I can pick up the hum of knobby tires on a four-wheel-drive pickup a half-mile away if the breeze is right. Almost every car is speeding, even pickup trucks loaded down or pulling a trailer.
With each successive one there seems in my mind to be less reason for it. This non-stop speeding traffic seems a personification of the stress and tension in our society (or my own stress, since I, myself, drive fast). Where are we all going? Wherever it is, we'll have to turn around and come back. And probably do the same thing again tomorrow, and the next day. What does it all add up to? Why even go at all? Why not just stay put? If we’re in such a hurry to get “there,” the future, does this mean we aren’t happy “here,” in the present?
I can see the people who took my picnic table have a cooler full of beer. I offer them cash for two beers. They give me the beers and refuse my money. Now, lying in my tent in the silent evening, I focus on my quiet, darkening private world. My legs are stiff and my blistered feet are starting to look like photographs I’ve seen of people in Third World clinics. I feel nauseous from too much sun. Switching mental gears, I listen to not one, but two different men in nearby campsites, apparently drunk, yelling at their women and kids in slurred voices and hostile tones.
As the evening darkens further something suddenly dawns on me: I’ve been here before; to this very campsite. I was with my second wife, now ex-wife. It was probably five years ago. I remember seeing that same crooked tree stump and wondering why they didn’t cut it flush to the ground. Instead, it stuck and still sticks two feet out of the ground at an angle, waiting for someone to fall on it and seriously injure themselves. We, too, arrived here late in the evening and it was then, as now, the last available, least-preferred site. We’d brought wine, though, and with each glass the campsite improved until, in the dark of night and under the cover of our tent, it became the most preferred campsite in the park.
My ten years with her bears examining. But it’s not yet safely far enough away in my rearview mirror for that. I feel like it’s all still a “Just Divorced” sign dangling from my rear bumper. I absolutely have to send her a postcard. I go back out to the picnic table and write her a short note, in almost total darkness. I have to be careful to say nothing that will anger her which, for me, will be harder than walking around a Great Lake. She isn’t speaking to me; hates me, I’m sure. I damned near hate the fact that she’s the only living person who knows of this place or will care (possibly) that I walked for two days to get here. But, in writing to her, I’m almost making her speak to me, or at least read me. Ha!
Dear Laura: I’m walking around Lake Ontario. Left Roch. two days ago. Am camped at Lakeside State Park. The exact same campsite you and I camped at with that weird dead tree stump sticking out of the ground. 500 miles to go. P.S. My extensive wardrobe for this international expedition includes that “New Yor Bass Fishing” T-shirt you gave me. RSG.
Distance: Covered 23.75 miles today, including the #!*@! mile I had to walk to this campsite from the park entrance (this is a BIG park!). That's 45.75 total miles in two days.
DAY 3: INTERRUPTION
July 6, 1997 – 6:45 a.m.
One of those drunken men from last night, directly across the park road from my tent, apparently passed out. He’s sleeping by himself this morning on a chaise lounge outside in the open air, on his back, his mouth open, snoring a drunken snore. The cover of darkness is gone. Day is breaking; the man lies in the middle of the circle, where people are now passing to get to the bathrooms and showers. He’ll have a nice sore throat when he wakes up, I’m sure, after sleeping outside all night in the cool lake air.
7:30 a.m. (Precisely!)
I depart my humble campsite which consists of one tree stump, one re-commandeered picnic table, and one pleasant five-year-old memory. One more notch in the rifle stock of this trek.
I walk 7.7 miles (including a mile just to get back out of the park) to the Family Spot. I can see through the window it’s crowded so I leave my gear out front. Today is Sunday and this tiny diner is filled with people who are dressed like they’re on their way to or coming from church. A table for two remains. I take a seat. We’re all being waited on by one cheerful teenage girl who doesn’t miss a beat. I have a dish of fruit, dry rye toast and black coffee.
10:00 a.m.
I mail my postcards at a busy, family-run gas station/convenience store. The owners – a husband, wife, and their two teenage daughters – are making deli sandwiches and ringing up gas and grocery sales like it’s the last shopping day before Christmas. I buy a bottle of juice and hand my postcards to the sixteen-ish girl at the register who seems delighted with the oddity of my asking her to mail them for me in tomorrow’s mail (and she hasn't even seen my sketches of flattened frogs). Back outside on the front steps, I can see a sign just to the west, close enough to read from where I’m standing, “Entering Niagara County.” Another milestone.
My mother taught my brother and me to walk. Oh, I don’t mean our first steps. I mean walking – or hiking – as recreation. We were middle-class, but we tithed. My mother was a Fundamentalist Christian (a problem for my brother and I growing up, one I won’t delve into here). My parents gave one-tenth of their modest income to the Church, my father would say. My mother would say, “To the Lord.” And they themselves, having both grown up lower than middle-class, income-wise were conservative with what little money we had. So, we didn’t have a big recreation budget. We didn’t even have a black and white television until years after all the other kids in the neighborhood were on their second, bigger color TV. My mother taught us gardening and walking. My brother and I helped maintain a backyard garden big enough to yield fresh vegetables either for salads or to cook for dinner almost every summer afternoon. And we went on walks, or rather, our mother took us on walks. We began nearby, just beyond our backyard where the trolley tracks ran in the old Erie Canal bed. The trolley didn’t operate on Sundays, so one Lord’s Day of Rest my mother coaxed us to walk the tracks. Walking rail tracks requires attention to every step. We paced ourselves, trying to hit every other rail tie. We walked from our suburban neighborhood where the birds chirped and the bunnies hopped, to the outskirts of the city, where steps to the trolley came down from overhead streets to the benches at the trolley stops where bums had left broken liquor bottles. They liked rum. And there was that unmistakable aroma of what you might smell in a bathroom; both “numbers.”
Summers at my grandmother’s cottage on the east side of Keuka Lake we walked up ravines cut into the hills by creeks that fed into the lake. When my grandmother sold that cottage we found another lake, Hatch Lake, near Morrisville, New York. There we rented a cottage for two weeks for several summers. Ours was part of a group of cottages. Many of the other renters were folks like us who had kids but had spent their recreation budget renting their respective cottages. Those folks, mostly the moms, were often open to walking. Many of the dads worked during the week, drove back to the city Monday mornings, and returned Friday evenings. We walked with the moms in the woods, along dirt roads and through abandoned pastures. 
The most memorable foray was walking all the way around Hatch Lake itself. It was only two or three miles. A physically active adult might have jogged around it without fanfare. But to children – our troupe that day ranged from age six to me, the oldest, at eleven – it was a trek, an unprecedented undertaking. To plan it and pack lunches, then walk it – passing all the individual cottages that up to then had seemed so far away across the water as to be unreachable, was seeing an abstract concept become a reality. With tired legs as proof.
4:00 p.m.
Okay, back to the fifty-two-year-old me. Somerset Cemetery: My mind is still ahead of my body; I want to go, go, go! As a result, my feet are already shot. My shins hurt, a pain that seems to reach higher each day; it’s now up to my knees. I’ve overexposed myself to the sun. My face feels burned. Here in the cemetery, on a comfortable spot in the grass I take off my Nikes and examine my bare feet where the only onlookers are headstones. My feet are chafed and blistered. Two of the blisters look infected; they are red, warm and itchy. I imagine a nice smooth bed where I could slide my feet in against soft cotton sheets and a real mattress.
Safe Haven
I’ve made it to Olcott, again, outdoing my daily distance projection. In fact now, distance-wise, at the end of Day Three, I’m one entire day ahead of my original plan.
After passing several possible campsites and not finding any to my liking, I’ve pitched my tent in a rather unlikely spot, on a sloped hillside overlooking Keg Creek, thirty feet below, and just across the road from the bright blue and aromatic waters of the lake. 
This makes me think of Keuka Lake, where I spent my childhood summers at my grandmother’s cottage, which brings to mind my brother. He was my 24-7 childhood comrade/rival in that tiny abode. For the last thirty years, he’s been a heavy equipment operator in a sand and gravel quarry. Unlike equipment operators in construction, who move from project-to-project, sometimes with lapses in work, he works six days a week, year-round.
He operates bulldozers and pay loaders in good weather, repairs and rebuilds equipment in bad weather (performing an oil-change on his one loader is a day-long process involving 350 quarts of oil and the replacement of as many as seven oil filters. One item on my bucket list, besides visiting the places in Southern France where Van Gogh painted cornfields and cedars, is to help my brother perform one of those oil changes. On the one hand I can hardly believe it really involves all that work. On the other, my brother is a man of so few words that the oil change may actually be even more complicated, he having neglected to mention a few additional steps in the process.
At sixteen, my brother worked afternoons and weekends for a man who owned commercial property, including Bull’s Head Shopping Plaza at Genesee and West Main Streets in Rochester. In tenth grade he plowed snow there with a front-loading tractor. When his fellow students were carrying books home from school, my brother was off to his after-school work carrying crescent wrenches so large some had their own separate carrying cases similar in size and shape to a banjo or guitar case. Our next-door neighbor, a retired electrician, saw my brother’s mechanical aptitude blossoming and gave him his welder. They set up a welding space in our garage and the neighbor even ran 220-volt electric service from his house to our garage because we had only 110-volt. Today, my brother can operate pretty much anything, from an arc welder to a bulldozer, as well as take almost anything apart and put it back together. With all the stuff he has going on now – kids, grandkids, working overtime, and rehabbing an old farmhouse in Honeoye, he might not even know I’m walking around Lake Ontario. He’s so busy these days there’s never a best time to call him. So, I do.
His son, Rich, my namesake, answers, and I’m not surprised to hear in the background the rhythmic sound of a hammer striking a nail. I am surprised when, here at my end, a car pulls up just below me next to the creek. By the time my brother comes to the phone I just have a chance to say, ""Hey, I'm camped on a hillside in Niagara County, overlooking Lake Ontario and I walked seventy miles to get here."" Young men have debarked from the car and as private and peaceful as this spot was moments ago, I’m witnessing what I perceive to be a mini-mob of “locals,” bored and looking for something to do.
Through my mosquito netting I can see them drinking beer. They snip cigarette butts into the weeds and throw empty bottles into the trees right near me. So far they haven’t looked up and spotted me. They look territorial, like dogs checking out the perimeters of their property. And here I’ve figuratively pissed against a fire hydrant on their turf. These folks remind me of myself and my friends when we were that age and of some of the things we might have done and, well, we weren’t Boy Scouts.
I tell my brother, ""I've got people here, I've gotta go for now,"" and disconnect. Miraculously the young men don't notice my Day-Glo orange tent sitting among trees within a softball pitch of their car. They drive off spinning their tires, throwing roadside gravel that bounces off tree trunks close to my tent.
I still have the phone in my hand. But, I realize, I have a greater need to remain immersed in what I’m doing right now, walking around the lake, than trying to catch up with my brother and explain why I’m out here walking around Lake Ontario. I’ll call him back another day.
I now ascertain I’m camped directly between where they young men were parked and the huge orange setting sun, which is probably why they don’t look up here and see me.
Today’s distance: twenty-four miles. Total distance covered in three days: 69.75 miles. I bought a six-pack of bagels earlier. I’ve eaten five. Positioned here by the creek, I should be about two-and-a-half miles from the next convenience store. Hopefully I’ll have coffee to go with this last bagel. A bagel and coffee…mmm, it’s going to be so good!
I write in my journal:
If there’s a copywriter somewhere who coined the term, ‘Posted,’ and if he or she is collecting royalties for every ‘Posted’ sign, she/he's got to be richer than Bill Gates, just from the number of square white signs papering the trees and fence posts of Upstate New York. Personalized bug deflector, seen on a 4X4 pick-up doing at least 75 mph: ""SHIT-N-GIT."" Judging from how fast he was ‘gittin,’ he must have been coming from some serious ‘shittin.’
DAY 4: GOING TO THE DOGS
July 7, 1997 – 9:00 a.m.
The Fourth of July Weekend is over. The highway noise – Upstate New Yorkers speeding to their holiday destinations – has subsided noticeably. Cars coming toward me so fast I can hear their engines whining before I can even denote their colors are now fewer and farther between. With that steady stream of noise gone, I realize how it was wearing at me. 
Gone, too, are the fireworks, from town events or families simply blowing them off in their yards. It’s Monday as I enter the Town of Wilson along the southern shore of Ontario. Celebratory explosions are replaced by the sounds of rural weekday commerce: a sheet of plywood vibrating as a power saw slices through it; an aluminum ladder clunking against the side of a house; the swinging tailgate of a dump truck slamming two or three times after dumping its load.
11:30 a.m.
I stop for lunch in what looks to be an old waterfront hotel and take a table on the deck. The sun is not too high in the sky yet and there’s a soft breeze coming in off the lake. A perfect formula for late morning lakeside dining. But the waitress won’t speak to me. I must remind her of someone she strongly dislikes. Maybe she, too, has an ex. It seems to me a lot of waitresses have exes. Or maybe I, with my backpack, remind her of something she can’t have – a day off. She brings my food, not with a “Here,” but effusing body language that says, “I have no choice but to bring this to you.” She never returns, never asks if I want a coffee refill or dessert, never brings me a check. I never get the chance to ask her what’s going on. She’s nowhere to be found. Finally, with no check, I walk from the deck into the main dining room of the hotel, and out the front door without paying. I’ve never done this before. I actually want someone to come running after me and say, “Hey, what the hell?” And I, in a gentlemanly fashion, hand the person cash and say, “Keep the change,” and suggest, “You might want to add to your menu ‘Waitress with attitude du jour.’”
Funny, both the waitress and the woman two days earlier didn’t like the looks of me. The woman two days ago finally warmed up.
Both of them seem to have attributed more negative energy to me than I supposed I could ever possess. Well, okay, maybe if I were having a bad day…but, I’m just a guy trying to get through his day – temporarily with a backpack, not a laptop.  Daring to venture outside his cubicle.
I’m enjoying long stretches of waterfront road. The sun is bright now and the lake, although vast and deep, is as smooth as a farm pond on a still day. Out of nowhere a group of office buildings appears to be sitting in the lake, several miles out. I check my map. The opposite side of the lake appears to be thirty-five miles away, seemingly too far to be as visible as what I just witnessed. Moments later there’s no trace of the buildings. A mirage?
Back to the real, tangible earth: I can no longer simply come to a stop in the normal fashion, but need to ""think"" stopping in gradual steps. If I just stop dead, I’m afraid I'll fall over forward, my knees being too weak to stop the forward momentum of my upper body, especially carrying thirty pounds high on my back. Walking takes more than the hundreds of bones, joints, muscles, tendons and ligaments of the toes, feet and ankles; it takes the whole body. I recall once I met a man in his eighties who for exercise rowed daily in a one-man scull on the Erie Canal. I could see the muscle tone from that arm-and-abdomen exercise all the way up to his cheeks, his temples and forehead.
Right now, I can't even turn my head to look over my shoulder. Looking behind me requires moving more than just my head, rather a slight twist of my entire body all the way down to my ankles. My knees can no longer take that twist. When I approach a side road and want to make certain no car is going to come from behind and turn into my path when I cross it, I need to cut forty-five degrees to my right for a step or two, so that looking back is now just looking to the side, to see if anything is coming. It takes a conscious effort to simply step three or four inches from the gravel shoulder up onto the paved road. In fact, I stepped/slipped off the pavement edge this morning, only my fourth day, and sharply twisted my left ankle. It feels like I snapped something inside. It happened so quickly and innocently, but so unmistakably, and now it hurts with every step.
This is extremely upsetting. With all the preparation I bring to this walk, something that occurred in a fraction of a second may now force me to change my plans dramatically; may cause me to have to quit.  I forge on into the evening; time to start looking for a campsite. I come upon the Willow Campsites.
“We don't take campers, only seasonal renters,” says the woman who, seeing I’m on foot, doesn't even come down to talk to me; she just yells to me from the second-floor balcony of her chalet-style A-frame office. I feel she’s discriminating against me because she doesn’t want my crummy little tent in with the big motor homes. I’m upset. I’ve been imagining a cool shower so vividly I can feel the droplets pricking my back and hear the water spattering on the shower floor. But as I walk back to the road, kicking the biggest pebbles in the driveway I dare kick without hurting my toes, I notice the place is filled with RVs and trailers and there is, indeed, a sign that reads, ""Rentals by the season.""
7:00 p.m.
In another half-mile I come to Ray's Tavern. I’m delighted over the prospects of some bar food, but I experience a slight sense of apprehension. What if the hostile waitress back at the restaurant where I walked out without paying called Ray’s and warned them to watch out for the guy with the backpack? This is, after all, a rural area, the kind where I assume people know each other for miles, especially if they’re in the same business. And as far as I know I’m the only one out here today with a backpack. The bartender at Ray’s, however, welcomes me and the patrons are too caught up watching baseball on a large TV screen to pay any mind to an absconder. Two hours, a small pizza, and several glasses of beer later, I leave Ray's with a seriously improved outlook on life, albeit now in the dark.
While I did pig out this evening, I’ve discovered – now on Day Four, I’m not necessarily that hungry after walking for days on end. I expected I’d crave food. I’ve since read that walking or running, while increasing blood flow to the muscles, also slows down digestion and suppresses the hormone ghrelin, which is responsible for hunger. Exercise also increases production of the hunger-suppressing hormone peptide YY, which can further reduce appetite.

9:00 p.m.
Safe Haven
I come to Four-Mile Creek State Park. At the park entrance, the registrar is a kid who can't be more than nineteen.
""Where do you want to be?"" he asks, eager to please.
I try not to exhale on him. ""As close to right here as possible; I'm walking."" 
So, I am now camped in an area reserved for campers with dogs, maybe thirty steps from the nineteen-year-old registrar, just across the driveway in the park office.
I pull out my diary. It’s something an ex-girlfriend gave me. The front cover shows sheep in a field. But the sheep are not grazing. Instead, all the white sheep are working at their computer stations. There’s one black sheep and he’s also sitting at his computer station, watching – on his screen – the white sheep working. The name given this illustration is, “Incognito.” Pretty much how I feel right now – out of my normal place and routine.
When I put the nub of my pencil against this paper this evening it does not move across the page with the same confidence as when I write in my daily walking journal back home, or with the same sense of urgency that I once scratched short-hand epiphanies on my Styrofoam coffee cups on the beach at dawn. I’ve left routine and security behind. When I now put pencil to paper it’s beginning to be more like tapping a microphone and saying, rather, asking, “Testing? Testing?”
Where I could once deliver entire concepts in thirty seconds on the side of a Styrofoam cup, it’s now different. It goes something like this: “The…day…is…” (Cross off.) “I…feel…like…” (Cross off). I finally manage to write “Fortunately there are no campers with dogs.” I stop, stare at the page, then close the diary.
Distance: Did twenty-two miles for the day in spite of twisting my ankle this morning. That’s 91.75 miles in four days. I don’t know what tomorrow will bring with this ankle.
A REALLY BIG HOLE
Back when I was still in college, my first wife and I (before we had kids) went to Florida one winter break to visit her father. We were driving in the Fort Lauderdale-Delray Beach area and passed a nice oceanfront home with a circular driveway. The driveway wasn’t paved with asphalt as is generally the case in New York. Rather, its surface was pea-sized gravel. In the driveway, on their hands and knees, were two men scooping up and sifting the small stones through a screen mounted on a wooden frame. Sifting out debris, my father-in-law said, like cigarette butts and leaves. He added that the Latino immigrants there in Florida would work cheap. So, you could hire them to do stuff like that. I thought to myself I’d like to be in that position someday. Not in the position of having an oceanfront home with cheap labor, rather to be the one doing the labor, sifting debris from a pea gravel driveway, by hand, one square foot at a time. I like processes.
For me, taking on large projects one-step-at-a-time hasn’t been restricted to just walking long distances. I like getting my hands and mind in it as well as my feet. If there’s a project to be done, I prefer to do it by hand when possible. In fact, I often find myself as focused on the process as the completion. For example, clearing a pool table. You don’t lift up one end of the table so all the balls roll into the holes at the other end, you clear the table one ball-at-a-time. There’s beauty in the process.
Talking with my brother on the phone twenty-four hours and twenty-two miles ago, as brief as that conversation was, caused me to recall such a project: that “sort of big hole” I mentioned earlier. College summers I worked for a large landscaping company. One year we had our biggest contract ever, landscaping a huge new shopping mall. This entailed planting hundreds of trees in front of stores, on parking lot islands, and along the outer perimeters of the seventy-some acre tract (Think fifty football fields). The use of a backhoe was forbidden in certain areas. Its weight might crush the underground sprinkler system, which had inadvertently been installed ahead of schedule. Those tree holes had to be dug by hand, with shovels or, as the older union workers called them, “Italian banjos.”
This was a blistering, sweaty, back-testing process that was artfully avoided by those same oldsters and so fell by default to the summer help. We worked in pairs. It took half-an-hour in the summer heat to pickaxe and shovel our way through the rocky earth and create a hole the size of a dorm room mini-refrigerator, big enough to bury the roots of trees wrapped in giant burlap balls. Over the course of a summer, a handful of us did this for perhaps a hundred trees, as well as for certain other smaller trees.
By September, I’d become a digging fool. I'd visited physical and spiritual places with my shovel many people born since the advent of the Industrial Revolution don’t know exist. I learned I could, if I simply ignored the time factor, accomplish – one shovelful at a time – just about any landscaping feat a machine could do. I also discovered I could harness Power Daydreaming and Fantasy Problem Resolution – remove lousy professors from my academic schedule or eliminate failed Middle Eastern states from the face of the earth, all while tackling buried boulders that grew steadily bigger before my very eyes as I tried to dig around them. I emerged from many a carefully dug hole feeling like a better person than when I’d initially cracked the earth. Plus, I got paid for it. There were many days that, for me, digging was a win-win activity.
That same summer my brother and his wife bought their first house, a hundred-year-old fixer-upper in East Bloomfield, six miles down the road from my and my wife’s apartment in West Bloomfield. Their house was in need of major renovation. The foundation was hand-piled fieldstone and the basement had a dirt floor; no one taller than an eight-year-old could stand upright in it.
My brother, three years my junior, is a hard worker. If there’s a way to utilize equipment instead of sweat, he’ll find it. He is not a laborer. If he can’t complete a project with equipment, he might not do it at all. If it absolutely must be done, he’ll hire someone else to do it. In this case, me.
I agreed to dig out the dirt basement so it could be useable space with a concrete floor. We worked out a price – a deal for him, because it was cheap, and a deal for me because it was under-the-table money and I was a college student with a wife and a 10-month-old daughter.
During that fall semester, I showed up at his house to dig on days I had no afternoon classes. If my wife was working, I had my daughter, Amy, with me.
My brother’s wife, Cyndi, would let us in. I'd go through the kitchen to the dining room, and open the closet door, the floor of which my brother had cut away just for this project. At this point in time this was the only entry to the basement. I'd lower myself into the basement, sinking a couple inches into the mud floor. Cindy would close the closet door behind me – rather above me, now, so her son, fifteen-month-old Jonathan and my twelve-month old Amy wouldn’t suddenly wind up in the basement with me.
Crouched over in the basement, I’d dig shovelfuls comprised of dirt, broken bottles, animal bones, and rat shit, and sling them through an opening in the wall, where my brother had removed an old basement window, out into the side yard. 
Digging was not made any easier by the fact that the dirt (I use that term loosely) was wet, heavy, and just as inclined to stick to the shovel as slide off when I tried to sling it out the window. On good days the shovelfuls smelled like long-neglected backed-up plumbing; on bad days, not as good. Because of the low ceiling I was forced to crouch over almost into a kneeling position while digging. I would become so focused on the digging I would forget myself and absent-mindedly attempt to stand up straight, banging my head on the ceiling. My first day in the basement, I banged my head three times in succession and Cyndi, upstairs, thought I was signaling her by knocking on the floor and opened the closet door to see what I wanted. 
When the pile of muck outside the window grew to a size blocking further slinging, I squeezed the shovel out through the window, went back to the closet, reached up, and knocked on the door. Cyndi opened it. Immediately behind her were wide-eyed Jonathan and Amy peering down at me in the hole, unable to understand why they were being left out of this really cool digging project. I'd pull myself up, sit on the doorsill of the closet, my butt in the dining room, my feet dangling into the basement, take off my boots and shake the black muck from them. Swinging around to stand in the dining room, I'd walk carefully through to the kitchen, tiptoeing, so hopefully no mud would drop off my pant cuffs onto the floor, and out the kitchen door. Outside, I’d sit on the stoop, put my boots back on, walk around to the other side of the house to the pile of reformatted basement floor, grab the shovel protruding from the window, and move the pile off to the side, again, one shovelful-at-a-time.
Then, I'd stick the shovel back in the window, go back to the stoop, take off my muddy boots, open the door and go back to the closet, where I'd sit on the edge of the closet floor and put my boots back on, lower myself back into the basement, and start shoveling again.
I had to dig out the entire basement to a depth almost two feet deeper than it was. As I worked my way farther from the window, I could no longer sling dirt through the opening. I was able to squeeze a wheelbarrow, or Mexican diesel, as those older union workers called them, through the closet door and into the basement by first removing the tire. Tire back on, I filled it up, wheeled it over to the window, and unloaded it, one shovelful-at-a-time. Then it was back up through the closet (there was now a ladder made of two-by-fours), off with the boots, back through the dining room and kitchen again to move the dirt pile that had grown outside the window, one shovelful-at-a-time. Back in the basement the digging actually became easier as I was gradually able to stand up straighter.
In an interview I once saw on TV, folk singer John Prine talked about being a mail carrier in his younger years. He described the job as pretty mindless. Once he learned the route and where the mean dogs were, the day passed; his mind became “…an empty library he could fill with books,” or song ideas. Having mastered the rhythm of digging out my brother’s basement, I was able to elevate myself, mentally, into my own empty note pad where I could outline college term papers, and speculative freelance newspaper and magazine articles. I spent the equivalent of about ten days in the basement, spread out over maybe three weeks. During all this time my brother was working from dawn-to-dusk at the gravel quarry, then, at night, converting the old pantry off the kitchen to a laundry room and bathroom.
My brother worked – and still does – alone, in the cab of whatever equipment he’s operating, and he likes it that way. He’s a man of very few words. One evening he came home from work and I was still shoveling in the basement. He lowered himself through the closet floor and looked around. I stood up straight and, I myself, beheld the basement floor as I imagined he might be seeing it. The many shovel blade marks in the damp earth were in surprisingly orderly rows, and the floor appeared amazingly level.
""It’s good enough,"" my brother said. These were and still are the only words he ever spoke in reference to what I’d done. Our years of shared experience as siblings rendered more words unnecessary.
But, secluded in the basement, daily, I’d begun to think of it as my own. If not my basement, at least my project. Much like, perhaps, a stay-at-home spouse thinks of the kitchen, where they bring culinary ideas from concept to fruition, as their space. When my brother’s feet disappeared up through the closet door that evening, I resumed shoveling for a while longer, getting in the last word. I’d know when the soup was done.
Shortly thereafter my brother and I salvaged four steel rails from an old, abandoned railroad bed, brought them back to his house, and laid them across sawhorses in his back yard. My brother welded them together, end-to-end, to make two separate twenty-foot long steel support joists, each comprised of two rails.
We slid those two heavy steel joists into the basement through the little window. We hoisted one end up onto the top of one basement wall, and the other end on top of the opposite wall. They spanned the width of the basement perfectly. We dug footer-holes in my dirt floor, poured concrete footings and installed adjustable upright steel posts from the floor footings to the railroad rails, reinforcing the basement ceiling beams, which, of course, supported the main floor of the house.
With these added reinforcements in, my brother re-opened an old doorway in the basement fieldstone wall, with old stone steps going up to the side yard. He then built a wooden form around the perimeter of the basement, for what would be the “floating” concrete floor. He then brought home a truckload of crushed stone and dumped it in the side yard at the top of the steps. I hand-shoveled it in through the door and he graded it across the floor.
My brother brought in bags of concrete mix and a motorized cement mixer. By the time we got around to pouring the concrete floor it was a bitter cold December day. I mixed the concrete at the top of the stone stairs and poured it into wheelbarrows and old five-gallon drywall paste pails, while my brother and two of his wife’s brothers wheeled and carried it down the stone stairs, dumped it, spread it, and leveled it off. We mixed automotive antifreeze with the concrete to keep it workable and allow it to set properly – not just simply freeze.
Over the next weeks my brother ran electricity down to the basement. He installed a hot water heater, fluorescent lighting, and a food freezer.
When my wife, daughter, and I went there for Christmas, the basement project was completed. I coaxed my wife down to the basement, along with my brother via the refurbished outside stairs, to show her what we'd done. Standing there in the basement, on the clean, smooth concrete floor, with shiny new white electrical conduit running along the ceiling, the freezer humming and warm glow of the soft overhead lighting, it was almost impossible to paint a picture for my wife of how this had all been a musty, stinking, dark crawl space, dug out by hand, with the floor poured in the numbing cold. It was a completely different place than what I’d opened the closet door to see on that first day of digging.
As we stood there in the perfect basement, the destination, as it were, I think I was the only one who truly comprehended the steps taken, the distance traveled, to finally arrive there
DAY 5: O’ CANADA!
July 8, 1997 – 6:30 a.m.
I wake without a dog in the designated dog owners camping area directly across from the park office in Four-Mile Creek State Park. I have to check my diary to see if this is the fourth or fifth day. Losing track of the days is an unanticipated, but strangely pleasing milestone, like crossing an international boundary of the mind, where another language is spoken and I’m starting to learn to speak it. I also hope to literally cross an international boundary on foot today.
And speaking of “foot,” I now have to work out a way in which to place my left foot on the ground, the one with the bad ankle. I set it down as flat as possible, rather than on my heel, then rotate to the ball of my foot. This requires being conscious of every step. Having to think about each step is not going to get me around this lake so I try to focus on not focusing. Sometime – mid-morning or thereabouts – I reach a place where I don’t have to place it quite so flatly, because it has become numb from the pain, and therefore there are brief stretches when I actually forget about it. Emphasis on brief.
9:00 a.m.
In eight-and-a-half miles, or about two-and-a-half hours, I come upon a breakfast opportunity in Lewiston, still in New York. It’s an old Fotomat drive-up, a little kiosk about half the size of a New York State Thruway toll booth set in the middle of a shopping plaza parking lot. In my case, it’s walk-up. It’s owned and operated by a pleasant and attractive woman named Gay. There are no other customers at the moment and Gay and I are chatting through the drive-up window, about her business and my walk.
We are getting along pretty good when suddenly out of nowhere a grumpy-sounding voice says, “She’s married.”
Turns out there’s an outspoken, ornery – actually, slightly humorous retired guy with a beard who’s her handyman, down on his hands and knees inside the kiosk, out of sight just under the wide take-out windowsill; he’s wiring something and listening to us. She smiles at me apologetically. I keep talking.
Grumpy persists, “You should probably be heading out if you’re going to make it to Canada.”
He’s right.
Closer to Canada, now, specifically to the Lewiston-Queenston Bridge that crosses into Canada, the traffic is building. If you're a walker or runner, you may understand how one who’s on foot can often feel inferior to those traveling in cars; a second-class citizen propelling one’s lowly primate self along the stretches of earth designed to serve the right of passage for the sacred motorized and four-wheeled members of our society. The American caste system.
The last miles before the bridge to Canada drive home this feeling of being steerage class. I walk under the relentless early afternoon sun, along shoulders of expressways, stepping over potentially lethal broken bottles, corpses of exhaust systems, and splintered tractor-trailer tires as big as human bodies. Cars fly past. I’m beginning to understand how someone who is wheelchair-bound might feel trying to navigate him or herself through day-after-day of the world of we entitled ambulatory humans.
I watch the horizon for troopers. There’s nothing I can do if one appears, but it helps take my mind off the sun and the heat. I walk facing traffic, the opposite of when I drove this route to map it so that with a plethora of merging lanes and entrance and exit ramps, it’s difficult to figure out which piece of pavement to be on in order to be walking in the right direction. When I drove it I took exit ramps. Now, facing traffic, I don’t have access to those ramps; I have to find the respective entrance ramps, which might be a quarter-mile or even a half-mile away from their respective exit ramps. So, my mileage markers denoted to the tenth-of-a-mile in my Safe Havens list are of little use right now.
Standing on an overpass, I look twenty feet down to the road below, where I need to be. Getting there on foot, carrying thirty pounds, and following the half-mile-long cloverleaf entrance ramp looping down and around – a thirty-second maneuver by car – takes ten minutes on a sore ankle and blistered feet.
I feel as vulnerable as a Native American with a bow and arrow walking into a volley of steel-bullet cars on a battlefield highway. If I turn around and look at signs, they tell me where traffic is headed, not where it’s coming from – which may or may not be where I want to go.
Ta-da! I apparently have made no wrong turns as I finally have the bridge to Canada in my sights.
What an awesome feeling! As I near the bridge, now on a residential street, I study the houses along this last stretch. They do not look special, as in “Almost Canada” or “Borderline” houses, but quite normal. I wonder what it’s like to live here.
“Where do you live?”
“Almost-Canada. If I walk out my front door and turn left, I’m in a province; turn right, and I’m in a state! Left, the British Empire; right, the Empire State. Being this close I must pledge allegiance to both countries!”
As I approach the bridge, it begins to sink in how far I’ve walked. I can hardly believe I've made it here on foot. I want to tell someone but there is the small detail of there being no one to tell. 
12:30 p.m.
I can’t help smiling as I step out of Lewiston, New York, and onto the international bridge that will take me to Queenston, Ontario. I am and will be for the next few hundred steps a man without a country. When I stop for a moment and lean over the railing to view the Niagara River nearly four hundred feet below, I feel the surgical scar from that year-old hernia operation tickle my lower abdomen.
Canada, here I come!
The bridge is a good quarter-mile long. Coming toward me from the Canadian side is someone else on foot. As we draw closer I see it’s a woman. As we near the middle of the bridge where the US and Canadian flags are rippling side-by-side in the wind, I see she’s about my age and carrying flowers and we’re going to meet almost in the exact middle. Is she bringing me a bouquet? Has someone set this up? I mentally review an inventory of friends who might do this. The list of people who even know I’m here is short; this must be a coincidence. I compose a clever line for when we reach each other: “Hey, what a great place to meet people! By the way I just walked from Rochester, New York to get here!”
We’re quite close, almost at the middle of the bridge – time to stop to see if she stops, or if I need to cut to the side on the narrow sidewalk and let her pass. She stops abruptly at the exact middle of the bridge at the flags. She turns, leans on the railing and looks down at the water below. I can identify with her slight backlash as she discovers the vertical drop.
Here, I discover the world at this moment does not revolve around me and the 200,000 footsteps in my wake. She turns to me, shaking her head silently, seriously, as in, “I don’t want to talk.” This changes the mood from high above the water, in the wind and sun, to a virtual candlelit evening church service where each member of the congregation arrives quietly and prays a moment before taking their seat. I sense she may have lost a loved one to the river.
I continue past her with a nod and now notice two men are watching her. They’re maybe a hundred feet away, on the bridge median, between the east and westbound lanes, sitting in a golf cart. One looks to be some sort of Canadian law enforcement officer and the other is an older man, who, judging from the concerned look on his face might be the woman’s father.
I continue along the bridge, stopping a couple times, ostensibly to look over the railing but really to look back at her. She holds the bouquet out over the water for a long minute, as if saying a prayer. She finally lets go of the bunch of flowers; they don’t separate from each other and waft to their destination in a breeze; they’re instantly sucked down and out of sight like they never existed. When I reach Canadian Customs, I look back and she’s following me, a couple hundred steps back. The two men in the golf cart are also returning, riding along slowly opposite her on the median.
This leg of my trek, from my starting point in Rochester to Canada, represents not just geographic distance, but a psychological hurdle – crossing the border. I’ve had anxieties about coming all this way and not being allowed into Canada, being turned back for whatever reason: looking like a hobo, or someone with criminal intent, or for being tired and sweaty, or perhaps just for being odd – trying to walk all the way around this lake. My walk across the bridge, however, hasn’t been the drum roll of apprehension or anticipation; I’ve been distracted by that woman.
The border crossing guy in charge of foot traffic appears to be a college student working for the summer. He eyes me curiously. In addition to being unshaven, I appear, I’m sure, to be exhausted. Thinking he might not believe I’m walking all the way around the lake, I tell him I’m walking to Toronto, which is actually true – I have to walk through Toronto in order to get around the lake.
I sense he doesn’t quite buy this. He asks me if I’ve ever been on the Bruce Trail. I tell him I never heard of it. This is clearly a disappointment to him. After all, I’m an international hiker, why would I not have heard of what I will later learn is the most well-known hiking trail in Canada? He finally waves me through without asking for identification (this is pre 9-11) or proof of financial sustainability. I get the feeling he may think I am indeed indigent, doesn't want to ask me if I have money, then be in the position of having to turn me back if I don’t.
I cross the multiple lanes of traffic to use the Canadian Customs bathroom. I’m shocked when I look in the mirror. No wonder the border control kid looked at me strangely. The part of my forehead above my nose – between my eyes – is so swollen from overexposure to the sun that it looks like my forehead is pumped up with air. I look like an alien from Star Trek. I’m not just from another country, I’m from another planet!
I didn’t map the portion of my trek between here – entering Canada and Toronto. I’d assumed once I crossed the border all roads would lead to Toronto; staying on the right track would be easy. But now, on foot, all I see are signs pointing to Niagara-on-the-Lake. I had to come fourteen miles inland from Lake Ontario to cross the Niagara River, so I’m not able to simply follow the shoreline of the lake as I’ve pretty much been doing for the last four days. Across the street from Customs is a circular village green. Underscoring my confusion, roads seem to shoot out from it in all directions like spokes on a covered wagon wheel. I don’t know which way to go. A sudden downpour helps me decide. I run for the cover of a “You Are Here” tourist map with a little roof over it.
Two young women join me under my roof. I Am Here; They Are Here; We Are Here. “They” are dressed as if right off the cover of Cosmopolitan. I can smell their perfume even in the rain. They’re not Cosmo aloof or coy, however, but friendly and unguarded, as if we’re friends and planned to meet here. They point me to what they call the service road, or secondary road to the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW), which they believe it follows for much of the way to Toronto and is open to pedestrians.
The young women run off. I wait until they’re out of sight before I pull out a green plastic trash bag, cover my backpack with it, and start out following the service road. The now-light rain is actually a refreshing relief from the scorching sun. There is almost no traffic on the service road. Alongside me, one hundred feet to my left, on raised ground, is the concrete wall of the QEW. I can hear the rumble of the traffic and see the smokestacks of semis protruding above the wall. The area slowly becomes suburban, then almost rural, and then the service road ends abruptly at a muddy T-intersection with a road that passes under the QEW.
6:30 p.m.
At the intersection a teenager stands leaning against his car, its hood up, in the rain. His name is Dan. He tells me where the service road starts up again. His directions are vague, describing a two or three-mile trek along back roads, with several turns and nebulous landmarks; “a sort of farm market” and “a big house.""
As I walk away from Dan and his car in the rain on that muddy road, he yells after me, ""Hey! You can cut through the orchard at the farm market and get there that way. If anyone says anything, tell 'em Dan said it's okay.'""
I walk a few more steps and then he says – louder, now, because I’m farther away, ""I used to work there.""
Another pause and, still louder, ""They probably hate me anyway!""
As a teenager, standing in the rain with a broken-down car, unable to go anywhere, Dan probably feels like that second-class citizen I described who’s walking when everyone else is driving. Or worse, because he wasn’t planning on walking.
Fortunately, Dan mentioned I’d find a Husky Truck Stop where the service road resumes, because I’ve forgotten the directions he gave me. I ask a woman in a sort-of farm market, in the village of Orchard Glen, how to get back to the service road and she doesn't know. Then I mention Husky, and right away she knows how to direct me. Still in pursuit of Husky’s and the service road, I come to a mansion with a small parking area.
It appears to be almost brand new. A sign says “Winery.” It doesn’t appear open though; there are no cars parked in front. Nevertheless, I walk up the driveway alongside the newly seeded lawn and in the front door. Inside, the place is as meticulously appointed, as if staged for an Architectural Digest photo shoot. Bottles of wine are displayed individually like religious icons in tiny apses on the wall of the elegant main room. This is definitely not a discount liquor store however I do find a Chablis that, with the thirty-four percent exchange advantage, is south of fifteen dollars. The problem is there’s no one here to pay. I wander into another room with the bottle of wine, down a hall to an open office door where a woman in a business suit sits up with a start. She doesn’t seem to know what to make of me even when I hold up cash and ask to buy the bottle of wine. We do, however, complete the transaction.
Finally, walking west along York Road, I see the Husky Truck Stop up ahead in the rain and, just beyond it, the orange running lights atop semis on the QEW flying toward Toronto in the falling darkness.
8:00 p.m.
Safe Haven
I get a room at Husky and soak my feet in the bathtub. The bed – my first real one in five days, feels so good simply sitting on the edge of it I can barely make myself stand back up and go eat.
In the restaurant I buy a local map and study it over meatloaf and mashed potatoes with gravy. I still can't figure out the route to Toronto. This area is so densely populated that the roads all blend together, even in the enlarged insets. Out on the road, still, the signs are all for Niagara-on-the-Lake, not Toronto. Niagara-on-the-Lake seems to be east, west, north, and south. I’m surprised I don’t see a Niagara-on-the-Lake sign pointing up to the sky.
As I lie in bed, falling asleep, I focus on Canada. I’ve made it to Canada!
Distance covered: twenty miles today; 111.75 miles total in five days.
DAY 6: WRONG TURNS
July 9, 1997 – 6:45 a.m.
I wake at the Husky Truck Stop to a cold rain. Dampness permeates the room. My socks I hung up to dry are still wet. I pull the curtains back and look at the dark, unfriendly sky. The hostile morning outside is duplicated by the Chablis hangover in my head. I am torn between the need for a spiritual pat on the back due to the utter gloominess of the day and the desire to celebrate my victory in reaching Canada.
I pick up my cell phone and call a friend. He’s not there. I call another, and another. So many people don’t answer that I work my way down my list of phone numbers to people I never thought I'd actually call. When, finally, Lou answers I start whining about how far I’ve walked and the pain in my legs and the overcast morning. There is no response on his end. I realize we haven’t talked in over a year. He was friends with my ex and I’m cognizant for the first time, at this exact moment, he’s been avoiding me since the split. In fact, a little birdie told me he was kind of sweet on her and she rebuffed his “friendship.” It also occurs to me I compiled this list of phone numbers more than a year ago, when I was in a more naïve frame of mind. I am quietly embarrassed. To top it off, these are some of the first complete sentences I’ve constructed in almost a week and I sound to myself like someone with no life, not a man with a purpose – walking through two countries – that’s two, God dammit, count ‘em! Somehow, Lou and I are able to escape each other this morning with at least some dignity.
Strangely, my ankle wasn’t bothering me at the end of the day yesterday. I was beginning to think I was winning a psychological if not physical game with my ankle: “Stop hurting because we’re moving forward, regardless.” Or maybe pain is just imaginary, like the office buildings I thought I saw sitting in the middle of Lake Ontario two days ago. But, back out on the road now, my ankle’s hurting again. As the morning progresses, my ankle gradually becomes numb and the pain subsides, at least somewhat. Is my ankle winning a head game with me or is it the other way around?
Back on the service road running alongside the QEW, I find it’s gradually becoming almost as heavily traveled as the QEW itself, albeit at much slower speeds. This local traffic seems comprised for the most part of trucks making deliveries to local businesses. The drone of truck tires, the invasive, almost violent gust of wind they cause when they go past, and the constant trembling of the ground from their stiff suspension and bouncing heavy weight, wears away at me.
This is Canada? I remember when this was all just a blank map colored green – as in “wilderness,” or so I thought. I wondered if I’d encounter bears here, maybe even wolverines. Would I be safe camping out in my tent? This was in the days before you could pull up maps on your cell phone. I was working off a paper map of New York State. I didn’t realize when you buy a map of New York that even though it shows those parts of Canada near the shore of Lake Ontario it doesn’t give you the details. The map makers want you to buy a map of that region. Now enlightened, I don’t think the bears or wolverines themselves would be safe here. And there’s no “green” to camp in. It’s a checkerboard of horizontal asphalt, vertical brick and glass. And the checkers themselves are on steroids; some have four wheels, some six, some eighteen. I’ve never been so cognizant of how much stuff gets carried by trucks. Names on the side of many connote automotive: Volvo, Cole, NAPA (as in National Auto Parts Assoc., not Napa wine country). Yesterday at the border trucks were lined up in double rows that stretched around curves and out of sight waiting to cross the border into Canada and, likewise, waiting to get into the U.S. There are so many of them they seem to have no identity, yet in each cab certainly sits a very real individual person.
Fragments of a telephone conversation between a trucker and his woman overheard this morning at breakfast in the diner at Husky: “Big tie-up at the border at Sarnia...G-8 inspection ...held up an extra forty-five minutes...”
1:30 p.m.
Now, in St. Catharine’s, I walk two miles along a river looking for a bridge across it, until I finally come to where I can see the river emptying into the lake, and there’s no bridge in sight. I can’t believe there isn’t a secondary road with a bridge somewhere that will get me across. The only bridge is the QEW with no pedestrian access. I have to go all the way back to the QEW and farther inland to find a secondary road with a bridge.
You might wonder: How hard can it be to follow the shoreline of a lake? Some days it can be impossible. Most lakefront property is municipal or privately owned and fenced, posted, or otherwise inaccessible. I have to follow the lakefront road as the cars do. Regularly, the road veers away from the lake to circumvent a natural or man-made obstacle – a river, a home, a power plant, a pier. I follow the road and hope that, once out of sight of the lake, I'll know which fork in the road will take me back to the waterfront and not simply to a dead-end or another impassable obstacle.
The gloomy morning is turning into a bad day for this once much-touted Gardner Campaign. The troops are discouraged. The leaders don't seem to know where they’re going; they didn't map this portion ahead of time and as a result we’ve gone on two dead-end jaunts of two miles each, then back again. That’s a total of eight miles out of the way. Aye, it’s that overly confident and underinformed American who’s at the helm of the U.S.S. Lost. There are murmurs of a possible mutiny.
Thoreau is best known for going back to nature and living in his cabin on Walden Pond, but he also had at least one other idiosyncrasy in his portfolio of noteworthy feats: he walked almost everywhere he went. He walked the two miles back-and-forth from Walden Pond to Concord on a regular basis and he explored the rural countryside near his pond on foot. He also walked the entire perimeter of Cape Cod, in those days still mostly doable on the beach. He spoke, in Cape Cod, of confronting uncharted bays and unfordable streams along the shoreline, forcing him to backtrack. Trying to get around a modern day lake is not much different.
And Thoreau had foresight when, in 1854, he wrote, in Walden:
At present...the best part of the land is not private property; the landscape is not owned, and the walker enjoys comparative freedom. But possibly the day will come when it will be partitioned off…when fences shall be multiplied… to confine men to the public road and walking over the surface of God’s earth shall be construed to mean trespassing on some gentleman’s grounds.
Verse 5, from Woody Guthrie’s song, This Land is Your Land, recorded in 1944, a hundred years after Walden, also addressed trespassing:
As I was walking I saw a sign there,
And on the sign it read “No Trespassing.”
But on the other side it didn’t say nothing.
That side was made for you and me.
I like Woody Guthrie’s take. I don’t need “No Trespassing” signs. I feel like I’ve already stayed put and not trespassed outside my safe routine for too long.
I trace my way back inland, passing many “gentlemen’s grounds,” trying to find a bridge over what appears to be a river. I discover it is actually a long, skinny pond called Fifteen Mile Pond. I see a Drug Shoppers in a strip plaza and go inside to look for medication for my swollen forehead. It’s so crowded I have to sidle my way along aisles which is difficult wearing my backpack with its exterior aluminum frame.

To my thirteen grandchildren and beyond—my thirteen reasons for writing Builder of All Things. You are the legacy I’m building, the inspiration behind every word, and the motivation to create something that lasts. I’ve known the weight of hard work, the grind of making ends meet, and the highs and lows of building something from nothing. But if there’s one thing I can pass down to you—not wealth, not status, not even all the lessons I’ve learned—it’s Jesus. Nickel and dime have I none, but Jesus is the only treasure worth leaving behind. He is the foundation that never cracks, the truth that never fades, and the legacy that will outlive us all. Hold on to Him, walk in His ways, and you’ll never be lost—no matter what life throws at you.
With all my love, Papa.
PREFACE
The world can be tough, and I think every business owner, at some point, needs a little encouragement to keep going. The marketplace is more than just a place to work; it’s also where we build, grow, and support the lives we’re creating. It shapes our culture and affects so much of who we are.
I’m at a place in my career now where people—other business owners, especially those in my market—are pulling me aside or reaching out with a simple question: how did you guys do it? They want to know how we became so successful so quickly. They ask, “With everything happening in the world and in our specific market, how did you survive it? How did you grow from a small, grassroots kitchen and bath company to one of the largest residential construction companies on the island? How did you go from doing basic projects to building the most prestigious homes in Hawai’i?”
At first, I would respond with a little laugh, followed by an answer rooted in honesty: hard work, integrity, and God as my source—but I could tell they didn’t really grasp the depth of what I meant. How could they? For most, it’s not just words; it’s the entire story, the unseen parts, the trials, and the faith it takes to walk through them.
Now, after twelve years—a span that feels symbolic, like twelve months in a year, the number of completion—I feel like I’ve lived a full cycle of running and operating a business. I’ve seen enough, fought through enough, and learned enough in this mission field to finally connect the dots for people—to go beyond the surface, answer, and show them the real source behind it all. This first book is my way of doing that. It’s my introduction, my way of pulling back the curtain and sharing the truths that have been the foundation of everything we’ve built. This isn’t just a story about success—it’s a story about purpose, faith, and walking the path God laid before us.
I feel it’s important to be open about my faith and who I am right from the start. For me, bringing my faith into this space feels natural and necessary. I want to be here to plant seeds of hope, purpose, and positive change in any way I can. This is what truly inspires me and makes this journey so meaningful.
This book is for all business owners and leaders, and I truly believe that, even if faith is new to you, there’s something here that can bring insight and inspiration. My hope is that you’ll find something meaningful to add to your journey. I know it might be easy to categorize me as “just another Christian” or think of this as a book strictly for Christians as you begin to turn the pages. But I also understand how that label can mean so many things to different people. With all the beliefs out there, it can be difficult to know what someone actually stands for. So, I like to describe my faith in a way that feels close to my heart: I’m a Jesus-centered believer.
For me, everything focuses on Jesus. I see Him as the core of my life. I believe He is the one who brings true connection and purpose. The Bible, in my view, is like a long, beautiful story with true historical accounts that highlight Jesus and reveal who He is from beginning to end. I believe He, in His role as the Son of God who came to earth and bridged the gap between us and God, offered us a way to experience deeper love, hope, and peace through a relationship with Him.
So, for me, Jesus isn’t just a figure in a book; He’s the true source of meaning and purpose in my life.
For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him. He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.
—Colossians 1:16-17
You’ll notice a lot of Bible references in this book, and it’s important for me to share these, as they’re the foundation of how I see things. For me, the Bible is one of the greatest tools we have, right alongside my own personal connection with God. Its stories and teachings have proven to be reliable and relevant over time. So, as I share what I’ve learned, I’ll be pulling from the Bible often; it’s how I reference the truths that have been revealed to me along the way.
I’m not here to establish one doctrine over another. It’s just important for me to be real with you in this book about myself and the perspective God has given me. I will speak straightforwardly about Jesus without any sugarcoating or agenda.
Let me ask you something. Wouldn’t you rather I just be straight with you right from the start? They call it “B.L.U.F,” bottom line up front. I want you to know exactly where I stand, where I put my faith, and where my journey has led me, rather than wrapping it all in some strategic agenda that hides the truth until the end.
I just want to be real with you, the same realness and truth I was searching for on my own journey.
This is simply my story, my experiences. Nothing hidden, nothing dressed up. I’ve tasted this life, and I can tell you that once I experienced Jesus, He is good. He is so good. And that’s coming from someone who’s tried so many different things in life, looking for what was real.
Over the past twelve years, I’ve grown in how I share Jesus’s message. It’s been a journey, especially in a world where faith can sometimes be misunderstood. When I first grasped what Jesus did for us, I was so excited to share this new hope with everyone. But I soon realized that, for many people, Christianity had sometimes been misused, leaving wounds. I learned how important it is to approach these conversations with sensitivity and empathy, knowing that not everyone fully understands who He is yet.
I had to learn to share Jesus’s message with the service of love, patience in life, walking joy, and real integrity. This growth took time. Twelve years ago, I was known as an evangelist, excitedly shouting what He did for us. But everything changed when my wife Tiffany and I left Hawai’i for a two-week mission trip to the Philippines. Walking through the streets of Manila, seeing poverty up close, I realized that our service of love and help, while well-intentioned, wouldn’t change the deeper need that remained long after we left. It struck me that while food was an act of love, people yearn for something lasting, something real. That experience changed me. I realized that true impact comes from either dedicating a lifetime to serving or sharing something that lasts. Something like the “living bread” Jesus offers. Imagine a hunger deep inside that no food can satisfy, a feeling like something is missing. I believe Jesus is the answer to that emptiness. He offers life, purpose, and meaning in a way that nothing else can.
These years in the business world have felt like a different kind of mission journey. I’m thankful for this season of growth, during which I’ve been able to learn, adapt, and meet people where they are with empathy—now understanding the true needs of those I serve.
So, as you step into this book, my hope is that you’ll find something here that resonates, whether it’s a bit of encouragement, a fresh perspective, or a reminder that you’re not alone on this path. I’m not here to preach or impose but to share the truth that has shaped my life and work. I believe we all have a purpose and that, deep down, we’re all looking for something real and lasting. For me, that “something” has been Jesus.
If you’re open to it, let’s take this journey together. I’ll be honest about the lessons I’ve learned, the mistakes I’ve made, and the experiences that have changed me. Thank you for joining me. I’m grateful to share this space with you.

First and foremost, I give all glory to God and His son Jesus—my source of strength, grace, and wisdom. Without His presence guiding me through every season, this book wouldn’t exist. He has been my foundation, my sustainer, and the architect of every opportunity, challenge, and breakthrough along the way.
To my greatest gift from God—my wife, Tiffany. You have been my rock, my iron, my unwavering partner through every high and every low. You’ve stood true, so true, in the system, sharpening me and positioning me to be the man, leader, and business owner God called me to be. This journey wouldn’t be what it is without you walking it with me.
This book is dedicated to my legacy—starting with my four children: Takiko, Tiyarah, Jordan and Anuhea. My prayer is that you take these lessons, these principles, and multiply them. Carry them forward, refine them, and continue to build something even greater.

SONG PAIRING
For this intro and through every chapter, I’ve carefully chosen a Lecrae song to pair with the words on the pages. Life has a way of giving us a soundtrack, a song that perfectly captures each season we go through. I figured, why not bring that into your reading experience? Let these songs elevate the journey, offering a deeper connection as you read. And who better than Lecrae, whose music has echoed the highs and lows of my own walk, resonating with both the struggles and the victories?

INTRODUCTION
ALL ABOARD
The Invitation to Join the Journey
“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.”
—Matthew 11:28
Have you ever felt like you’re carrying the weight of every decision, every risk, every sleepless night? Like the endless demands of running a business are just too much to handle alone? Do you sometimes wonder if anyone truly understands the pressure you face? The relentless balancing act of keeping clients happy, managing finances, and leading a team that depends on you. Do you question whether there is a greater purpose behind your endless grind—perhaps some reason that extends beyond chasing profits and performance?
What if you’re not just overworked but carrying burdens that were never meant to be yours alone? As entrepreneurs, business owners, and leaders, we often take on more than others realize. It’s like everyone around us is lifting a manageable weight while we’re left struggling to bear something far heavier. It feels like being in a gym where everyone else is lifting one hundred pounds while we’re struggling with 450. The responsibilities of clients, employees, products, finances, and health just keep piling on until the burden feels impossible to carry any longer.
Have you asked yourself, even in those moments when you hit your goals, whether the success you’re working so hard for will really bring fulfillment? We’re constantly chasing after success, but the challenges of keeping the doors open never let up. What if, instead of running harder, there was someone who could walk this journey with us, offering a source of strength, guidance, and purpose far beyond what we can find on our own?
The challenges are constant, and sometimes, they keep us up at night, leaving us unable to sleep because no matter where we go, we carry it all with us. We’re driven by this hunger for success, chasing it relentlessly. But along the way, we face challenge after challenge: paying taxes, managing payroll, chasing invoices, and trying to keep everything afloat. It’s overwhelming. Sometimes, we get caught in a whirlwind of survival, scrambling for resources like bank loans and investors as we max out our credit cards. All just to make it over the next hurdle. We search for the right connections, scroll through social media for inspiration, listen to speakers, follow quotes, hire business coaches—anything to feel like we’re moving in the right direction.
But what if there’s another kind of resource? A source of guidance more powerful than all the coaches, consultants, and motivational quotes combined? Something you could tap into, not just to realign your path, but to walk it with confidence, even through the darkest moments? Imagine a journey where every step you take is guided by an unseen hand, a partner who knows the paths you’ve missed, the challenges you face, and the dreams you hold deep within.
We’ve all had those sleepless nights, lying awake, staring at the ceiling, wondering if we’re making the right decision, unsure which road to take. But what if there was a way to know for sure? What if there was a source of light to illuminate the path designed specifically for you, one that not only shows you the way but also fills you with confidence and clarity about where you’re going and why?
After years of navigating the demands of building a business, juggling endless responsibilities, and facing moments that left us questioning everything, my wife Tiffany and I realized that there was more to this journey than simply pushing forward. We found ourselves reaching for something greater. A source of understanding our purpose that changed the trajectory of not only our business but also our lives.
I can’t tell you how deeply grateful I am to open up this part of my life and share our story with those who may be feeling the same weight. I know what it’s like to chase your passions relentlessly, pouring everything you have into your business, only to feel burnt out and exhausted, wondering if it’s worth it. I’ve been there, feeling like it’s all on me, shouldering a burden that only seemed to grow heavier. But one day, everything changed.
As I share my personal experiences, I strongly feel that Tiffany and I are collaborating on this. This book stems from our shared experiences in building our business. When Tiffany and I launched our first business, I personally had no clue what I was doing or getting into. It took a lot of studying and going through the process to adapt and grow.
OUR BACKGROUND
After enduring overwhelming hardships, like two devastating house fires in my childhood and Tiffany’s family struggling with homelessness during her high school years, we began our life together from a place of no financial support. The idea of starting a business felt like an impossible dream, weighed down by our lack of resources. Yet, we pushed forward, leaning on nothing but faith, refusing to give up even when everything seemed stacked against us. We started from scratch together and persevered.
We have faced many ups and downs, drawing strength from our previous life experiences. Even in our toughest moments, we found that these experiences brought us closer to each other. Over twelve years of running the business, we have built and now steward an award-winning, nationally recognized, eight-figure business.
Like many of you reading this book, I faced my fair share of challenges growing up. But looking back, I can see how my purpose unfolded. My family did not have a lot of money and lacked the means to help me financially beyond high school.
My parents sat me down and, with heavy hearts, told me that they were still struggling to recover from the devastation of our most recent house fire. As difficult as it was to hear, they reminded me of my gift as an athlete and how I could use that gift to earn scholarships and fund my education.
Their words filled me with determination and a sense of purpose, inspiring the hustle within me. From my young perspective, sports scholarships felt like my only lifeline to a college education. It was the only path I could see then, the one glimmer of hope in a future that otherwise felt uncertain and out of reach.
The dream came true when I was recruited to Lake Forest College to play football, with everything paid for. But after just one semester, that dream slipped through my fingers. I lost it all because of a low GPA, overwhelmed by the load of being a full-time football player while juggling six demanding classes during my freshman fall semester. Without the guidance I desperately needed, I couldn’t keep up. Losing that opportunity left me facing impossible tuition fees and feeling lost and vulnerable.
I was then recruited into the Navy with what I felt was the last option I had to make a difference in my life. Talk about a difficult pill to swallow at nineteen years old. After I completed boot camp, my first duty station was Pearl Harbor, where I immediately met Tiffany. I felt like I went from rock bottom to hitting the jackpot in the year 2000 with the opportunity to move from my little city of Peoria, Illinois, to Hawai’i.
Now, after twenty-four years with Tiffany, shaped by a deep love and guided by something bigger than ourselves, we’re finally bringing this book to life. We’re excited to share our story, the journey of building a business, and the impact that the special guidance of our faith has had every step along the way.
WHAT TO EXPECT IN THIS BOOK
The main takeaway I hope you find in this book is the power of a fresh perspective to ignite and navigate your unique calling. I believe each of us has something important to steward, whether it’s a business, a family, a vision, or a community. Stewardship isn’t just about managing and caring for what we have; it’s also about leading with purpose, using our resources wisely, and creating something that serves others and lasts.
Whatever you’re working on—whether you’re building a business, nurturing your own home, or leading a team—it’s more than just the success of fulfilling a vision. It’s also about building something meaningful. In this book, I also hope to spark a deeper calling in you, encouraging you to view your journey through a lens of purpose and significance. This perspective is what brings a lasting impact that goes beyond financial gain or outward success, anchoring you in something that leaves a legacy.
Many of us step into entrepreneurship driven by a desire for financial freedom. But it’s your perspective that shapes the real rewards of the journey as you decide whether what you build will stand the test of time and serve people. If you picked up this book hoping for a quick roadmap to more profit or a fast track to financial success, let me be real with you. This might lose your interest pretty quickly. But I’m asking, no—I’m pleading with you—to stick with it anyway. I do believe that what you’ll gain here is worth far more than a balance sheet can show.
Looking back, I can see how my path was meant for entrepreneurship, and the lessons I’ve learned are universal. Whether you’re launching a new business, running a nonprofit, or already in the thick of things, maintaining the right perspective is what keeps you grounded, giving you endurance, purpose, and even peace when challenges come.
Maybe you’re starting a business to follow a passion, create generational wealth, or make a lasting impact. Whatever your reasons, the insights in this book are here to help you see it through.
One of my top five favorite movies of all time is The Family Man, starring Nicholas Cage as Jack. If you haven’t seen it, it’s about this guy named Jack whose fast-paced luxury lifestyle changes on a Christmas night when he stumbles into a grocery store holdup and makes a deal with the gunman. Like a modern retelling of A Christmas Carol,2 the next morning, Jack wakes up in bed next to his college love on Christmas morning, whom he left years ago to pursue his successful career. He’s shocked to discover his former life no longer exists and finds himself living through this alternate universe and perspective, where he must choose between rebuilding his prior successful lifestyle or sticking with what he believes is the toned-down version with the woman he once loved and two kids.
Jack’s sudden shift in reality enables him to dig deep and see what truly matters to him. He sees his life from a new perspective, appreciating the importance of family over material success.3 The contrast between his two lives emphasizes the impact of perspective.
As author John Martin describes in his book Choose Your Perspective, perspective is the way you see life, and perception is understanding what you see.4 My goal in this book is to go even further and help you develop a vision that brings purpose and power to your life.
If we understand the power of renewing our perspective in our everyday lives, we can potentially change how we perceive our circumstances. Being open to new ways of seeing things can lead to a shift in our perception and develop a new way of believing what we see. Being more aware of our path and willing to see things in a positive light can alter our viewpoints, potentially leading to personal growth and even healing. This can help clear the fog from our lens, so we can see our purpose in life with clarity, positioning us to reclaim our belief, stand in our truth, and walk confidently in our power.
So, what if I told you that I have a new perspective that ties everything together and a fundamental truth that can transform your life and how you perceive your calling and life forever? Are you interested?
While I’m eager to share, it does make Tiffany and me quite vulnerable. Being transparent about our business and life events exposes us to sharing deeper, real-time events that have occurred. We have many more books to come after this one that we are eager to write that focus on applications in business and leadership in the marketplace. Still, this book serves as the most important stepping stone, the foundation—its contents are crucial. It’s a must-read.
This first book is designed to lay the foundation for stepping into your calling in life. Whether you are beginning your journey in entrepreneurship, in the midst of running a business, or facing difficulties in your company, this book is for you. We’ve also experienced the overwhelming highs and lows that come with running a business. Very few like to talk about the hardships.
As business owners, we rarely get the chance to lower our guard and reveal what’s really happening behind the scenes. We constantly have to project confidence, always wearing the face that sells our products and services. Just one hint of the struggles or challenges we’re facing can feel risky. It might mean losing future opportunities that only add to our burdens when, sometimes, all we really need is just a few more clients to make things right.
Perhaps you’ve faced declining sales and skyrocketing overheads or the IRS scrutinizing your taxes. Maybe cash flow is dropping, and you’re struggling to keep up with payments. Maybe your staff are either not showing up or not working at full capacity, leading to a high turnover rate. Competitors might be luring away clients, resulting in dissatisfied customers and potential legal action. The changing market landscape could be prompting you to adapt your services or products where it feels like you’re consumed by busyness, constantly chasing after cash and unpaid invoices. Or the catch twenty-two: your family life is slowly slipping away due to your overwhelming involvement needed to keep the business afloat, but if you take a step back, even for a day, you fear the company could collapse. We have seen and experienced all these common challenges in entrepreneurship. We want to assure you that this book offers guidance to keep your business afloat even in the face of adversity.
NAVIGATING THIS BOOK
In Part 1: Building Together, we will explore how shifting your perspective to see yourself as a steward rather than an owner can unlock a source of strength and enable you to guide your business with purpose—not just for profit. At the end of chapter 1, we will do something a little different—I suggest that instead of going straight on to chapter 2, you jump ahead to the end of the book for a sneak preview of chapter 10 before circling back to chapter 2. This is crucial for understanding my perspective, and rather than spoiling the end, I believe this will enhance your journey through the book.
In Part 2: Beginning the Course, we lay the foundations for shifting your drive from ambition to calling and aligning your heart with your purpose, which will set you up to stay on course throughout the inevitable storms that occur in the life of any business.
In Part 3: Battling Adversity, we will look at the different kinds of challenges you can face, how to identify them, and the best approach to overcoming these, both practically and spiritually.
Finally, in Part 4: Birthing the Legacy, we will look at how seeing the bigger picture can enable you to lead with confidence, be more creative in problem-solving, and waste less energy on things you cannot fix. Ultimately, I hope you will realize how empowering it can be when you embrace the belief that our paths are predetermined.
Thank you again for taking the time to learn from our experiences and reflections on faith and business. In this book, we hope our shared path can provide a solid foundation for your business journey, ensuring you sail through rough seas and emerge stronger.
Welcome aboard!

CHAPTER 1
THE SKIPPER:
Builder of All Things
Stewardship vs Ownership
“For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.”
—Hebrews 3:4 (ESV)
GRAND ARTIST
I’ll do my best to bring this to life for you. As a builder, I genuinely appreciate every moment each day. During my morning drives up the H1 East highway, I usually try to ease into the day with a steaming cup of hazelnut-flavored Lion coffee while in my work truck, tiptoeing through the usual traffic. As I’m headed to one of our construction sites, these moments behind the wheel offer more than just a drive to work and some really good local coffee; they’re a chance for me to savor the island’s stunning scenery.
I’ve always loved looking up at the Hawaiian mountains as they provide a majestic backdrop against the slow traffic. In the Midwest of Peoria, Illinois, where I was born and raised, the landscape was characterized by flat lands and cornfields. In Hawai’i, on the other hand, lush green mountains cover almost every drive, regardless of which side of the island you’re on. As a construction company owner, this view has always inspired me. A big part of the appreciation I feel when I gaze at the beauty of these mountains is that man didn’t make them. The sun rises behind them, washing the sky with color and light like a picture painted by a Grand Artist.
Looking at mountains always fills me with a sense of awe. It’s so humbling. It truly minimizes all I think I have accomplished in my life. I often contemplate the luxury homes our amazing team is working on and think about how those big houses seem so tiny in comparison. I recall a specific moment involving one of our projects in prime Orange County, California. This property was positioned at the end of a cul-de-sac at the summit of the Newport coast, offering sick (amazingly good, outstanding) views. After a long, very challenging day of work on this house, I remember a specific evening driving down the mountain back to my hotel. It was a day I felt defeated, as I was in new territory outside of Hawai’i and couldn’t seem to get the traction to move things forward like I was used to. But what really challenged me was the fact that I was alone. I was away from my wife, Tiffany, and our family for a week at a time for months.
NOTHING CHANGED EXCEPT HOW I LOOKED AT IT. MY PERCEPTION WAS REDEFINED.
As I drove down and looked up at the house, still strategizing my game plan for the rest of the week, an unexpected revelation struck me. Two things became increasingly apparent. First, the grandeur of the mountain became more evident—from below, I was able to see how grand it actually was. Second, the house gradually shrank until it was only a mere speck. All the houses on the hill looked like a bag of Skittles scattered across a golf course, ultimately overshadowed by this majestic creation. This experience and moment opened my eyes to the power of perspective in how we perceive the world as individuals and how we should respectfully position ourselves. Standing at the foot of this grand mountain made me realize how small my daily problems, challenges, and struggles were in comparison to its size. The house we were remodeling had felt so significant when we were on top of the mountain, along with the pressure of the natural construction stress it brought me that day. Now, it was so small that all I could do was laugh. Nothing changed except how I looked at it. My perception was redefined.
As a business owner and builder of custom homes, I know the intricate process it takes to bring a structure to life. The scheduling, the design, the blueprints, each nail meticulously placed, every piece working together for structural strength and functionality. Everything is thoughtfully engineered to not only stand strong but also create a space where life will be lived and loved.
Now, imagine standing in front of a towering skyscraper. If I asked you whether human hands crafted it or it somehow just appeared, it would seem ridiculous to think it simply exists without a builder or design. As a builder myself, I can’t overlook the logic of creation. And when I look at our vast, perfectly balanced world, with the oceans, the seasons, the towering mountains, the sustainability of life and resources, and the Earth’s perfect placement in the universe from the sun, it’s clear to me there must be a Creator—a Master Architect, a CEO, an Owner, an ultimate Builder of All Things. To deny that would be to ignore the very essence of what I understand so deeply in my own work and business.
This perspective brought me a deep sense of peace, knowing that this Creator oversees everything. It revealed to me the profound impact that shifting my focus could have—not only on my understanding of life but on how I view my circumstances. Now, when I think of the mountains, they pull me into a place of reverence. They’re a reminder that we’re part of something far greater, a vast creation that God Himself crafted.
Every day, this perspective helps me to align my heart, reminding me who I truly serve and who the real Owner of everything is. I am not the owner; I’m simply a steward. Knowing this has freed me. It repositions my role—not as the one in control, but as someone entrusted with a purpose, serving the One who built it all.
THE SPOTTER
As I share our company stories and our humble beginnings, I’m thankful that God positioned our hearts from the very beginning to steward the vision He had of our business. By sharing this, I hope you will understand the importance of including God from the very beginning.
To be honest, we had no idea what we were getting ourselves into. Not a clue! All we knew for certain was that we had God with us. This time in our lives aligned with a season of deep faith for Tiffany and me, knowing if we did start a business, it would honor God. As the years went by, I realized that I had no guidelines for incorporating my faith and beliefs into the business, let alone starting or running one. I was just ready to climb this mountain with God.
Growing up, I was an ambitious young kid, constantly exploring the unknown. My mom used to share with me how I would always just run off and do dangerous things. One of my favorite “dangerous things” to do was to climb. It was quite common for me to climb walls that a kid my age had no business climbing, and I would do it with absolute fearlessness. My parents had a difficult time keeping up with me; I’d take off the moment I felt that first taste of freedom. I just couldn’t be held back! Here are a few memories worth sharing. I remember going with my mom to the bank when I was around four years old. While my mom was cashing a check, the bank teller directed her to turn around as I climbed the bank’s structural rock column all the way to the ceiling. I was at a point where I was stuck and needed help. My mom was just tall enough to grab me and help me down.
There was also another scary moment when I was with my dad and family while he was rock climbing a one-hundred-foot rock wall. He did this as a hobby during my childhood days. He would have gear strapped on for safety and climb regularly with his friends. Unknowingly to my dad and family, I followed him from behind with no gear. If I were to guess, I would say I was about six years old. I was following my dad’s path and had my eyes fully on him. I stayed focused on what was in front of me and kept looking up to grab the next bulging rock edges to keep my pace, and I got pretty darn far. Imagine the feeling of the rough texture of the rock beneath your fingertips and the sense of excitement as you look up.
As I climbed higher, the view around me became more breathtaking, and I slowly felt the freedom of what my dad experienced when he climbed. Eventually, I realized there was nowhere else to go; the next rock to grab was too far out of reach for a six-year-old kid, so, as you can imagine, fear kicked in. I finally looked down, began to panic, and started to cry. My perspective instantly and dramatically changed. When my dad discovered me, he immediately headed toward me and was able to climb over and, thankfully, save me.
Later in my childhood, in an alley behind my parents’ house, I climbed a tree to a very high point like a fearless expert to hide from some neighborhood kids while playing. A kid named Scott finally found me hiding up there as part of some outdoor game we had created. Out of excitement, he started to throw branches and things at me to get me to climb down, eventually causing me to fall for the first time in my climbing career. This fall was unlike any fall I had experienced. I actually felt like I was floating on the way down. I hit the ground hard enough to knock me unconscious and break my arm, putting me into a cast for months.
LIKE A MUSCLE, FAITH CAN GET STRONGER AND STRONGER, OR IT CAN POTENTIALLY GET INJURED IF WE ARE NOT IN THE PRESENCE OF A SPOTTER.
Only then did I realize the risks involved in my fearless climbing attempts. After that, I stopped climbing just for the sake of it. I allowed the injury to paralyze me for a while, fearing to climb with the same courage. It took me years to rebuild my confidence and climb again. As a builder, I need to use ladders, lifts, and climb scaffolding, all essential for constructing homes. So, I had to face my fears and overcome them.
I learned something about myself: my bold climbing escapades as a young child began with the presence of my parents. Slowly along the way, they instilled confidence in me that I would be saved even to the point of climbing halfway up a one-hundred-foot wall. This confidence became ingrained in me, leading me to attempt climbs even when my parents were not around to save me if I got into trouble and badly injured myself.
Looking back now, this reminds me of how our faith is. Like a muscle, it can get stronger and stronger, or it can potentially get injured if we are not in the presence of a spotter. In weightlifting, a spotter is someone who assists the lifter during their exercise, primarily to ensure safety. The spotter’s role is to help the lifter complete their reps, especially when they’re pushing heavy weights or nearing muscle fatigue. In terms of faith, a spotter could be a trusted spiritual guide, a community, or even God Himself. Someone or something that helps us build resilience and endurance in our faith journey, catching us if we falter and encouraging us to keep growing safely and steadily.
When God is with us, there are moments when He reaches down, takes hold of the lifting bar, and guides us with His strength. And then there are times when He lets us bear the weight on our own, yet He’s always there, right beside us, ready to catch us if we stumble. He wants us to grow in confidence—not in our own strength but in His. Just like those moments when I was climbing, it’s a powerful reminder that stepping out in faith means leaning on God, not relying on my own strength.
There’s a story in the Bible about a fisherman named Peter who was a close follower of Jesus. One night, Peter and the other disciples saw Jesus walking on water toward them during a storm. Peter was amazed and wanted to join Him, but walking on water was beyond anything he could imagine doing on his own. With Jesus encouraging him, Peter took that first step out of the boat. It was a bold act of faith that would shape him in ways he couldn’t yet see. And Peter actually walked on water, stepping forward and toward Jesus. His courage to do this didn’t come from his own strength; it came from the fact that Jesus was right there with him. That physical presence gave him the confidence to do something extraordinary.
Later, when Jesus was no longer physically with Peter, Peter didn’t lose that courage. Instead, he grew even bolder because Jesus had promised something remarkable: God’s presence would remain with him—not beside him but within him—through His Spirit. Having His Spirit within is like having a “spotter” within. Someone who provides you with confidence and courage. And it’s not limited to a specific place or moment. The Spotter is always there, empowering and reminding us of what we’re capable of when we trust and lean into that connection.
Later, this same fisherman, who had once hesitated and feared the unknown, found himself boldly standing in front of thousands, confidently sharing the message of Jesus’s resurrection. Imagine that—going from casting nets to delivering what was basically a TED Talk to a massive crowd. But here’s the thing: Peter only dared to step out onto the water in the first place because he had Jesus—his ultimate “Spotter”—right there with him, ready to catch him if he fell. That same presence is what gave him the confidence to speak with boldness later on.
It’s scary to think about the reality of climbing the one-hundred-foot wall without gear now, knowing in the real world, I could have died if I’d fallen. With God, He will not let you fall if He is present, especially if it’s the wall He is guiding or commanding you to climb.
I believe we all have stories where God has saved us or intervened to steer us away from poor decisions, particularly when we are in His presence. But what if He is calling you to climb a mountain? Imagine being called to face a moment that seems far too big, a challenge that feels like a mountain towering over you, daring you to climb it. For most of us, fear takes over, and we start to believe we’re incapable.
Take these biblical figures, for example. As an adult, Moses was a man who had distanced himself from his past in Egypt, living a quiet life as a shepherd, far from the hardships and struggles of his people. Then, one day, he felt a calling, a pull he couldn’t ignore. He was called to climb his own mountain—a call from the “Spotter” to return to the very place he had once fled. His mission was to stand before the mighty Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, and demand freedom for an entire nation. Imagine the weight of that responsibility. Moses wasn’t a powerful speaker. He actually doubted his abilities and questioned why he was chosen. Yet, despite his fears, he stepped forward like Peter, placing one foot in front of the other. Forward and toward his destiny, knowing that he wasn’t climbing this mountain alone.
Richie Breaux
Builder of All Things: A New Perspective of Purpose with the 'Business Partner' You Didn't Know You Had
4 ratings","Builder of All Things by Richie Breaux was a five-out-of-five read for ANYONE, but especially for business owners. I can not list a single thing I did not like about this book. Breaux walks the reader through various life events, both from his personal life and his business experiences, and ties these experiences to his faith as a Christ follower using scriptures from the Bible. Interestingly, he also ends each chapter with a song suggestion to match the message of the chapter. I have never read a book where an author included songs to help deepen the readers' understanding of their message. I truly appreciated and enjoyed that new approach.  The book was clearly professionally reviewed and edited. I couldn’t find a single error. This flawless approach really allowed me to focus on Breaux’s story and message without the distraction of grammatical mistakes.  Breaux’s writing seamlessly carries the reader down a stream where each chapter is like a soft bend opening up into a beautiful view. This book may be specifically marketed to entrepreneurs, but I would venture to say it can apply to any leader. This includes leaders at home, in the family, at work, or in business. I found every chapter extremely relatable as a homeschooling stay-at-home mother of three. The author's choice to use scripture to support his perspective was natural and easy to digest, understand, and apply. The writing style seemed effortless, and the flow was like the aforementioned stream as the author led the reader through different phases of life while using biblical references to tie the teachings of the Bible to modern-day life. I will definitely be using the principles, scriptures, and advice Breaux offered in this book. I have already begun recommending it to family and friends, and I will continue to do so. I will be working to use what I learned from Richie Breaux every day moving forward and I can’t wait!"

RE-JUDGMENT
I’d been afraid that the Juror and the General was too ancient to re-print at this time. But after reading it 20 times in the past year as I re-typed the original I was able to read it with Total Objectivity; It gave me the chills.
Change the names and dates and the trial would sound the same for events going on today. Lying about the number of deaths in the Covid pandemic, lying about the numbers in the presidential election, lying about the Capital riot.
I’m brought back to my old friend Jim and my college days before the Viet Nam campus protests.
I went to college in New Haven, not the Ivy League University but the State College I could afford.
What’s great about being in the same town as Yale was the free lectures and eminent speakers, packing their halls. My friend and I went to them all. We closed Michael’s Pub over pitchers of beer. Jim liked to pound the table disputing things we just heard. He hated social injustice and the bureaucracy. He was a social worker who knew both well. We had a good time in lively debate and beat subjects to death.
We both aspired to be writers.
We ended up going separate ways when I moved from New Haven.
***
Years later, I received a letter from him. Would I have time to read his new writing?
Shortly before his letter arrived, I had a life-changing accident.
Going up a hill I skidded on black ice. My car went straight into the path of a Mack Truck (the garbage truck variety).
My ankle was shattered and I was hanging around the house in a wheel chair with lots of spare time. Writing was a great way of keeping me from obsessing over the next surgery I needed to correct the unsuccessful previous ones.
They don’t tell you what condition those crash survivors are in. I myself will never again hike the Appalachian trail.
In school you are expanding your mind with years of open thinking and debate.
You graduate into a world so focused on making a living you forget who you are. Maybe I could finally write the story that I’d been wanting to for years. I couldn’t get the emotions on paper—they were still raw.
I was thrilled to have someone to try it out on.
“If you’re having a hard time writing about it, you probably shouldn’t write it,” he advised. I was trying to document the impact my father’s bipolar disorder had on me. Mental health had a stigma in the 1960s. He’d tackle me for car keys as he screamed! “You’re going to die in a crash.”
When I remember those days, a cold hand grips my heart. Someone told me bipolar was genetic. I worried that it could happen to me.
Less than a year later I found myself sitting in a jury box at the top of a huge bank of marble stairs; of a federal courthouse in New York City.
****
This story is about the perfect Juror. Optimistic, trusting, believing in our government. A teacher who spent her life learning how to teach children to live productive lives.
Within a year after the trial she left teaching and followed her own buried dreams.
After pursuing several careers in painting she began to seriously write. She worked with an editor on a book about becoming an artist. When she mentioned to him that she’d been getting inquiries about the now out of print ‘The Juror and the General’ it was her editor Richard Kelley that suggested she put aside her present project and update her book about the Westmoreland vs. CBS trial which had been billed as the trial of the century in 1984.
INTRODUCTION
Westmoreland v. CBS
The ISSUE on Trial
January 23, 1982 CBS aired a program called THE UNCOUNTED ENEMY A Vietnam Deception.
It was produced by George Crile and narrated by Mike Wallace. The documentary was based on investigations done by Sam Adams, who had been a CIA analyst, reporting a much larger enemy number in Vietnam from 1966-1968, than the military was reporting to the American people, even perhaps to the Congress or the White House.
While researching Sam Adams’s allegations, the producers of the documentary found further evidence to support his claim—that the Tet offensive (the turning point of the Vietnam War) should not have been the military surprise that it was.
The documentary finished dead last in the TV ratings that week, but it produced minor waves in certain circles, of which Westmoreland was a part. He had been Commander-in-Chief of ground forces in Vietnam at the time of the Tet offensive. On January 26, 1982, he held a news conference denying the allegations set forth in the broadcast. The issue seemed to have been put to rest.
But TV Guide carried a cover story written by Don Kowett in May 1982, which accused CBS of defaming General Westmorland with the material it had presented in the broadcast.
This reignited interest in the documentary and General Westmoreland felt he had grounds for a libel suit. He began to approach some prestigious attorneys who refused to take the case. Meanwhile, CBS began an internal investigation re-evaluating the materials it had used.
In the summer of 1982, the Capital Legal Foundation, headed by Dan Burt, approached General Westmoreland offering to handle the case at no expense to him.
CBS offered the General fifteen minutes of prime-time to air his views and refute the broadcast. Westmoreland refused the invitation and continued with the litigation.
In September 1982, General William Westmoreland filed a suit against CBS, Mike Wallace, the narrator of the broadcast, George Crile, the producer, and Sam Adams, the consultant for CBS. He initiated the litigation in South Carolina, his home state. Attorney David Boies was successful in having the trial moved to the U.S. District Court in New York City. He represented Cravath, Swaine & Moore, the law firm CBS had hired for its defense. Judge Pierre Leval presided over the case. The First Amendment was at issue.

KEY PLAYERS
Samuel Alexander Adams (June 14,1934 – October 10, 1988) Known as Sam Adams, was an analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency(CIA). He is best known for his role in discovering that during the mid- 1960s American military intelligence had underestimated the number of Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army soldiers. Although his opinion was challenged, he pushed the case for a higher troop count.
David Boies,(March 11,1941) . He attended Northwestern Law School and graduated from Yale in 1966. He was the lead attorney with Cravath, Swaine & Moore representing CBS, Adams, Crile and Wallace. Boies already had a reputation for taking risks. Other lawyers had turned down this case, thinking they’d likely lose. Boies was a gambler. His first win was to have the trial moved to NewYork City. He also had some additional ideas.
Dan M. Burt, (born 1942) His early years were challenging, working at a variety of jobs and attending several schools, he ended up with a law degree from Yale Law School in 1969.
1980-1985 Mr. Burt was president of the Capital Legal Foundation, a public policy, not for profit law firm engaged in cultural warfare. He represented General William C. Westmoreland in this law suit pro-bono.
George Crile, (March 5,1945-May 15, 2006) was a television news producer who specialized in attacking controversial subjects. His formidable topics earned him a reputation that won awards and drew stinging criticism. Much of his career was spent on 60 minutes. This trial was a notable clause in his obituary.
David M. Dorsen ( born 1935) He’s been a jurist on several high- profile cases. He was assistant chief counsel of the Senate Watergate Committee. He has taught at several law schools from Duke- to Georgetown University Law Centers. He’s an author of both fiction and non-fiction books including books on two justices Henry Friendly and Antonin Scalia. He represented General William Westmoreland in this libel suit against CBS.
Myron Leon “Mike” Wallace (May 9,1918 – April 7,2012) was an American journalist, game show host, actor and media personality. He interviewed a wide range of prominent newsmakers during his seven-decade career. He was one of the original correspondents for CBS’60 Minutes, which debuted in 1968. Wallace retired as a regular full-time correspondent in 2006, but still appeared occasionally on the series until 2008.
William Childs Westmoreland (March 26 1914 – July 18,2005) was a United States Army General, most notably commander of the United States forces during the Vietnam War from 1964 to 1968. He served as Chief of Staff of the United States Army from 1968 to 1972. He brought the libel suit against CBS, the case that is the subject of this book.

TRIAL
THE CALL FOR JURY DUTY
M. Patricia Roth is summoned for jury service on October 9, 1984, at 9:00 a.m. in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. So, says Raymond F. Burghardt, Clerk of the Court.
Autumn is the busiest time for an art teacher. I’d introduced an advertising course for the sixth graders to invent a product and make a video commercial for it. They were as excited to work on this as I was to see the results. The art budget is due. I’m working on a commission for an art gallery and the biggest sale I’ve had so far in my part-time real estate job.
It’s the worst time to be called for jury duty. It is only for two weeks so I guess I can handle it.
October 4, 1984
Spent most of the day planning meals for the next couple weeks.
The girls are coming up for the weekend. A rarity now that they’re both in college.
I made appointments to take clients to see a house in Pawling and one in Brewster.
October 7, 1984
Took the Murphy’s to see the Spencer house in Pawling. They’re thinking about it. The new clients I took to the Moran house were a waste of time. I think looking at houses is entertainment for them.
This afternoon went apple picking with Leslie and Tracy. The weather was spectacular. Nice and crisp, not a cloud in the sky. At home the girls peeled the apples, Bob sliced them and I baked two pies.
October 8, 1984
We’ve been planning the logistics of getting to court and decided to drive the 60 miles on the first day.
I got ready for bed. Bob turned on the eleven o’clock news. The announcer said jury selection would begin tomorrow for the libel trial of the century: Westmoreland vs. CBS.
Bob got excited.
“I knew it! You’re going to be on that case!”
“Who’s Westmoreland?” I asked.
“Where were you during the Vietnam War?”
I just shrugged.
“Oh God!” he groaned. “Never mind, you’ll be the perfect juror.”
My heart sank. I set the alarm for 5:15.
October 9,1984
Bob was right, the commute is horrible and it appears to be a big case. Reporters were lined up three deep along the walls of the courtroom. Potential jurors filled every seat. Forms were passed out and names called. The bailiff had a booming voice. He was bald, corpulent, serious—perfect for the part.
“If there is anyone else with a problem, raise your hand. This is your last chance to make appeals.” One woman had a sick mother at home, a nervous-looking man had his own business and a family to support. Another man couldn’t understand English. I marveled at the cross-section of people. A clerk spoke through a microphone telling us about mileage forms and toll receipts. We were ushered out to the hall and placed on elevators. Then crammed into a courtroom, seated in pews like in a church, others lined up along the walls. People sat at elevated platforms in front of a judge. Everyone around me was whispering. There’s so and so—he’s on Channel 5. There’s the guy from that cable station. That one is General Westmoreland. The guy next to me reading Variety, wearing camouflage fatigues told me he was going to get off; he works in a court upstate someplace.
The bald man from downstairs was now standing on the platform below the judge. He was spinning a drum, and calling names. Meanwhile, they had passed out questionnaires ‘Checklist for Prospective Jurors.’ Not one damn question applied to me. I’d never been in the armed forces. I didn’t read TV Guide nor follow movies or read books about Vietnam, nor did I care about it. I had always thought we were in good hands in Vietnam—both in terms of our leaders in Washington, and also in the military. But as I read down the list, I felt downright embarrassed. Bob complains that I don’t keep up with anything but art and real estate. The lights in the courtroom were glaring. I kept looking around. We were given questions for each juror.
1. Age
2. How long have you lived in this country?
3. Occupation over last five years. (Unemployed)(Retired)
4. Marital status
5. Occupation of spouse
6. Occupation of children
7. Level of education (details)
8. Residency over last five years
9. Residency between 1965-1970
People’s names were picked out of the drum like a lottery. Jurors were questioned and eliminated; new names were called. This went on all morning.
The judge was questioning the latest lottery winner and asked when her husband had been in the military. “He was in the Second World War and I’m not sure what he did.” “And your daughter’s fiancé?” “No! He’s not her fiancé anymore. But you know they were childhood sweethearts and then they got engaged, but they didn’t get along, so she dumped him.”
Laughter broke out in the courtroom.
The judge answered, “Gee, you had us in suspense there. I’m glad it all worked out!” The next woman called was affiliated with one of the law firms representing one of the parties in this lawsuit.
That got a big laugh and rejection.
Finally, lunch time.
Back in the courtroom a woman my age sat next to me. We began to chat. When I found out she worked at the New York Public Library I told her about my commission. I needed photos of the Grimm Brothers. Turns out she was in charge of the library’s photo collection. We exchanged addresses. It was a long afternoon but it gave us time to get acquainted.
Four p.m. just after a late afternoon break the bailiff reached into the drum for the umpteenth time. So far only one person has been detained to be on the jury. They had him sit in the first seat of the jury section. I began studying him. Why did the lawyers choose him?
The bailiff called another name. M. Patricia Roth! My heart jumped into my throat. I felt a dull ringing in my ears. That was me! My usual confident self - turned into rubber. I almost couldn’t stand. Somehow, I made it to the front of the courtroom and turned to see every face looking at me. I was glad I opted for one of my real estate outfits instead of my usual arty style.
Somewhere in the distance I heard my name again. I was told to answer the questions on the list we were given. Start with your age and how long you’ve lived in the U.S.
How anyone could hear me I didn’t know. It sounded like I was in an echo chamber. I didn’t want to give my age in front of all these people. I made the mistake of stealing a glance at the reporters with pencils in position. My God, everyone in the world will be able to read....
“I’m forty-two years old; born in Connecticut.” I was actually speaking!
“I’ve taught art for twenty years. I’m also a real estate agent; married.” The reporters were feverishly writing. The court recorder was clicking away. Every eye was glued on me. My throat got dry.
“And where were you between 1965 and 1970?” asked the judge.
“I had an art gallery in San Francisco.”
Mr. Burt, the lawyer for General Westmoreland, asked one additional question. “Who do you most admire in politics or government?” I simply answered. “I wish there was someone!”
I was told to take the second chair in the jury box! I sat down and my hands began to shake. I had to sit on them. Does this mean what I think it means? I was in a state of total shock.
We were dismissed at five o’clock.
THE PERFECT JUROR
October 10, 1984
We made it to midtown by nine-ten where the anxiety began. Traffic was coming from all directions. I jumped out of the car a block away, and raced to court arriving a minute late. The judge was at the sidebar with some attorneys. A deranged person had been sitting on the subway tracks at Forty-Second Street and all power was shut off. Several jurors told of waiting for a half hour on a train between stations.
The judge spent the first ten minutes impressing upon us the importance of being on time. Everyone will be inconvenienced if even just one juror is not present. Today was the only exception.
The same procedure was followed as the day before. A few more were chosen to sit on the jury. This went on until 3 p.m. when my new friend Cheryl, the librarian was called. She asked to go to the sidebar. I was not surprised her request to be excused was denied. She seemed to round out the jury. The judge announced the jury had been selected.
From this point on we the jury are not allowed to enter through the front of the courtroom or mingle with anyone having anything to do with this case. We were only to use the restrooms in the jury room. The only time we’re allowed to leave the building or make calls was at lunchtime. We were given a fifteen-minute recess, and the clerk showed us our new habitat. A long table filled the center of the room, with twenty leather chairs around it. There was a long coat rack at one end of the room and a men’s room and ladies room at the other. It was drab and depressing.
They called us back to the courtroom.
I found out yesterday that all one does in the jury box is watch people. I wore my new silk blouse, something I wouldn’t dream of doing in the art room. Maybe there’s a bright side to this stint; I can dress without the fear of spilled paint.
The judge swore us in. He read the rules and steps to expect. He stressed the magnitude of this trial. The First Amendment was being questioned.
He emphasized what an important job had been laid on our shoulders and how we had to keep a clear head, and an unbiased attitude, and not allow anyone to influence us. Stay away from all TV, radio and newspaper accounts. He went on for an hour. I was scared.
Westmoreland had been there from the beginning; examining every face in the jury box. His table was in front of the judge, with his counsel by his side. Behind Westmoreland was the defense, George Crile and Sam Adams, along with their counsel. They were being sued by Westmoreland along with CBS, and Mike Wallace who was not here today.
The judge spent a lot of time talking about a chart. He passed a copy to each of us. It became known as the X chart. It explained how we were to interpret the evidence. He also passed around legal pads. They were to stay locked in the jury room. He thought we would need them for this lengthy trial with so many witnesses.
It was unprecedented to take notes in the courtroom.
GOING ON GUTS
October 11, 1984
The council for the Plaintiff took up most of the day. He read 30 pages of notes unemotionally.
He showed us segments from the ‘Uncounted Enemy,’ telling us cuts had distorted the issues. It appeared the press was having trouble following him as well.
Mike Wallace was present today.
Four of us got to know each other as we lunched together. Back in court, we listened to Mr. Burt’s concluding statements.
Next, we heard from the defense attorney. This presentation was different. Two enormous easels were placed in front of the jury. David Boies, spoke very purposefully and reviewed each statement. He too showed segments of the broadcast and gave his point of view.
October 12, 1984
Court was called; the defense attorney continued in the same manner as the previous day. He was slow and deliberate using easels on which he illustrated the contents of various documents. He explained the meanings of some of the military acronyms. Those were so convoluted; my head was spinning.
When I got home, I scribbled off a note to my pen-pal.
Dear Jim,
I don’t know how to tell you this but they accidently gave me your jury seat on a big trial—The Westmoreland vs. CBS case in Federal Court in NYC.
I promise I will take good notes for you.
My Best,
Pat
October 15, 1984
It was cold today. The jurors arrived all complaining about the commute. We shared stories about our weekend. Finally, into the courtroom.
The same characters in the same seats. The same reminders from the judge.
The plaintiff’s attorney called his first witness, Dr. Walt Whitman Rostow, who had been National Security Chief under Lyndon Johnson.
If that title alone wasn’t enough to impress us, we were told he’d written twenty-four books.
He’d taught at Oxford, Yale, Harvard, and presently was a professor at the University of Austin.
With his help the chain of command was outlined on an easel facing the jury. Burt questioned him for over an hour. Do you recall? In your opinion? Where were you in November of 1967? There was a meeting in Saigon! Did you have figures for the number of Vietcong? Did You? Do You? Have You?
I couldn’t take notes fast enough, so I just stopped and listened. We broke for lunch. My backside was aching!
It was David Boies’s turn to question the good doctor. Boies had him repeat certain statements and re-questioned others.
All I could ascertain was that Dr. Rostow had no confirmed figures regarding the strength of the Vietcong.
I think the issue is—Why wouldn’t our military include the thousands of SD and SSD guerilla fighters that were as responsible for killing our soldiers as the North Vietnam Military forces?
The number 280,000 kept coming up! That’s how many North Vietnamese we were fighting; according to the official reporting, SD ...were Self Defense, SSD were secret self-defense.… Many were women and children; some were old men. None of them wore uniforms.
The military refused to count these numbers. They were just townspeople; however, they were armed.
Mr. Boies continued to cross examine Rostow, who refused to be pinned down.
“Were there 15,000 enemy coming down the trails each month?”
“I can’t answer that I had no way of knowing. There were conventional infiltration counts and the Johnson infiltration counts.”
David Boies jumped on this; from then on it was, “Well, according to the conventional infiltration counts, would you estimate that there were 10,000?” Still no affirmation.
The conventional counts came from the POWs and CIA counts. As Rostow admitted these were grossly inaccurate because of the time element.
Court was dismissed.
October 16, 1984
Each morning we signed a sheet by the door. The clerk read it. When everyone was present he’d lead us into the courtroom.
Walt Whitman Rostow was still on the stand. We listened to more painful testimony. He had these broad losses of memory.
He was a likable fellow, with looks that one immediately took to. It was obvious from his presence, and from his credentials he was a man of remarkable intelligence. Was his memory really failing him? My belief was that he was doing his best to avoid answering questions.
But then he would tell long elaborate stories sounding like he was trying to be helpful.
It was juror 14’s birthday. I asked the foreman if we should take up a small collection to surprise her with a birthday cake after lunch. He just shrugged but Juror 3 began passing around a note. We were back in grammar school. “It’s Norma’s birthday, donate 50 cents for a cake.”
It’s welcome comic relief. We returned from a short break to find Robert W. Komer, on the witness stand. His testimony was the exact opposite of Dr. Rostow’s. The doctor had a soft literary way about him, like a philosopher.
Komer was all business. He was the chief civilian deputy to General Westmoreland. He was in charge of CORDS in Vietnam. He was definite, no nonsense, with testimony that was factual and precise. Komer talked about himself. What Komer said, what he did, what Komer thought, what he put into action.
He was immediately aware when he got to Vietnam that there was something wrong with the numbers that the MACV had been using. He spoke of heated debates with the CIA and MACV.
Komer himself didn’t feel that the SD, SSD or the Home Guard should be included in the enemy count. It was too difficult to keep accurate count of the enemy that they were tracking now as it was! The figures they were getting from the official sources were several months off.
From what I heard him say about their problem with numbers was that they had a problem among themselves.
Was the president ever made aware of these numbers? (I didn’t find that out today.) It was obvious though that they were concerned about the press finding out.
Several documents were given to us as evidence. The attorneys love to object, hearsay and so on.
Lunch felt like it was a long time coming. We got Chinese take-out and ate in the park.
We bought Norma a birthday cake and sang Happy Birthday, as she blew out the matches that we improvised as candles.
We had more of ‘The Komer!’ for the rest of the afternoon.
We were dismissed at four thirty.
October 17, 1984
Back to my teaching job, I had to make a presentation to parents at open house last night.
I can’t believe I was able to pull it off. My mind was still at Foley Square, listening to The Komer.
And here he is again, sitting in the witness chair ten feet away from me.
I get the feeling after today’s testimony, and putting it into context with yesterdays, that if there was a cover-up or distortion of facts it was most likely on the CIA level! Did Johnson know the figures? Hmmm? I get the feeling someone higher up than Westmoreland should be on trial.
I could be wrong, I’ll probably change my mind with eighty more witnesses to be called.
One thing I’m not wrong about is this guy’s ego. He was a wonderful asset to the Vietnam entourage; just ask him. He’s a forceful convincing speaker. However, he doesn’t shut up.
Komer was in charge of CORDS! That was an acronym for CIVIL OPERATIONS AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT.
That doesn’t sound to me like he was concerned with enemy numbers!
This military jargon is getting to me. The titles of the various operations would never make the bestseller list. The acronyms are necessary; it takes too long to figure out what each of the divisions actually does.
I asked the foreman to ask the judge to have a list made up for us so we could clarify the meaning of these acronyms. He flatly refused, claiming how can he do that? There is no such list. He claimed I’m the only one that has asked.
I’m a little annoyed. My feeling is they’d be delighted to have the jury know what’s going on in the courtroom.
Today, we learned that the Pike report confirmed the uncounted enemy numbers is not new. The Pike report found them irregular. I would say the testimony of Komer is dubious. He has come up with a few humorous comments. I wish I’d been able to write quickly enough to capture them. One was—upon reviewing intelligence reports of SNIE, we realized that SNIE had a SNAG!
Who knows who SNIE is or does? Damn! We must get our hands on a list of acronyms and their meanings.
Komer also talked at length about the WIEUs, which were the Weekly Intelligence Estimate Updates. They were held every Saturday. The bigwigs from MACV reported to General Westmoreland at these meetings.
We were dismissed at three-fifty today.
October 18, 1984
The weather has been nothing short of perfect since the trial has started. Though we’re confined to the court and jury room, it makes getting to and from the courthouse rather pleasant. I can tell the way that Foley Square is set up it must be brutal during inclement weather. The wind can whip through here, I discovered on the one windy day we had.
We stayed at Bob’s father’s apartment last night. I found a good spot on the street so I decided to leave the car there. I took the subway today. Last night the doorman told us he chased away an ornery looking guy from our car. Even the doorman next door reported the guy came back and had tried to break into our car, but he called the police and they chased him around the corner.
This has made me anxious about leaving the car in the city. It’s a SAAB turbo with the reputation of having a great sound system. I’ve had it less than six months and already had two radios stolen.
I took matters into my own hands today, at the prodding of some other jurors who were also having trouble with the military jargon. I handed a note to the court clerk, who in turn handed it to the judge, who read it aloud in the court room.
YOUR HONOR,
Would you be so kind as to arrange to have a list of military acronyms made up for the jurors? Though we understand SD and SSD and MACV most of the others have us stymied.
It’s difficult to follow who is being spoken of and what their purpose is.
The entire courtroom broke out into loud laughter.
The judge directed the letter to the attorneys of both parties. It did become clearer today. Both attorneys stopped after each group of initials to explain their meaning. Even one of the main witnesses, a former major general, when asked to tell what a certain group of initials meant could not recall the entire meaning.
Komer had a bit more testimony and was dismissed after forty-five minutes. Most of his testimony concerned the counting of the SD and SSD. MACV and SNIE almost came to blows about how to count them. Komer, himself felt they were too difficult to count.
I thought to myself was it a case that they were too difficult to count so just ignore them? Or did he not believe they were a military threat?
Colonel Caton was the next to be called to the stand. He had impressive credentials, dating back to World War II. He was elderly but most likeable with a touch of a hearing problem. He had a dry, solemn direct manner. He pulled no punches and told it like it is. He often broke up the courtroom with his answers, maintaining a dry composure the whole time. The audience was laughing with him but he never cracked a smile. At one point he told the attorney to speak to him. “I can’t hear you when you turn your back.” The attorney apologized and asked, “Sir, can you hear me now?”
“Yes!”
“If you can’t hear me, just ask me to repeat it.”
“I just did!” Caton answered.
Everyone but Caton laughed. Never cracked a smile.
His job was to get the estimates of enemy strength from the field each day. He said this was no easy task for he also had to establish their validity. You can’t always rely on what a POW tells you. They’ll say what they think you want to hear. He published daily reports.
To me, the data that crossed his desk seemed more pertinent to counting enemy than what had crossed Komer’s desk. He was a regular at the WIEU meetings but placed himself in a lower command capacity.
Caton was modest about his role, he stated that those higher up looked at a broader spectrum. This Colonel was only interested in his daily estimates, in his district of concern. He described the role the SD and SSD played. Although, they did not use conventional weapons they did do a lot of damage. They made booby traps, some amounting to nails and such, attached to boards that upon being activated would do severe damage to troops. He was cross examined at length. My understanding is that Caton believed they were definitely an entity to be dealt with.
Mr. Dorsen took over for Mr. Burt today; I was looking forward to having a new, more experienced counsel. After ten minutes I realized he was boring, put it up as evidence, then read from the document along with us.
If you want to read boring stuff, read military documents. Thank God for our judge. I can’t believe how he can sit there, take notes and become so involved that at times he will bring up his own questions to clarify the situations.
“Colonel Caton, had anybody been assigned to help you to gather data?”
“Oh yes, but it didn’t help that much. I had to dismiss him!”
“Why, Sir?”
“Oh, he was incompetent. He couldn’t do the job.” He paused. “Hey, I didn’t want to give these guys a bad report. You had these guys for thirty days and had to write a review on them. I just didn’t want to do it. I’d tell him, go get a job you can do!”
“Did you get many people that couldn’t do the job sir?”
“Oh, yes, quite a few!
“How many?”
“I can’t answer that, I don’t remember. You have a bad experience and you want to put it out of your head.”
We had a moment of levity when the Court Recorder spoke up and asked the Colonel to “Speak slower and speak up, I can’t catch what you’re saying!”
“Oh! I forgot about you!”
That brought down the house.
It doesn’t take much to distract the boredom. By four o’clock I was slapping my face so I wouldn’t nod off in front of the entire court.
When Caton was asked if he had ever heard the General say “What will I tell the President?” He said, “No, he never said that. That would have been totally out of character. But I heard Wheeler say that!” He was questioned at length by the defense attorneys. “When did you hear Wheeler say this?”
Wheeler had just returned from Washington where he briefed the president on how we had crossed over the line, and the enemy numbers were declining. When he received these new numbers, he was furious. “What am I going to tell the President?”
The defense attorney has worn the same navy jacket every day. The Plaintiff’s attorney up here from Washington wears a different sea-green tone suit every day. This has been a major topic of conversation in the jury room. Today, Boies surprised us with a pinstripe suit.

The Light Beneath the Mask
""What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.""
— Ralph Waldo Emerson
At some point in life, most of us grapple with the quiet fear that we’re not truly good enough, that maybe we don’t deserve the praise or success we’ve achieved, or that others will eventually discover that we’re not as capable, knowledgeable, or confident as we appear. Even when we’ve worked hard and earned our place, a lingering sense of inadequacy can creep in, whispering that it was luck or timing rather than talent or effort that brought us here. This feeling, often known as imposter syndrome, can make even the most accomplished person question their worth, leaving them wondering if they’ve somehow fooled everyone into believing they’re more competent or put-together than they actually are. Yet the truth is, nearly everyone experiences this doubt at some point, and it’s not a reflection of our true capability but rather a sign that we care deeply about what we’re doing and want to live up to the faith others have placed in us.
How Has Imposter Syndrome Affected Your Life?
Have you ever felt like a fraud, despite your accomplishments? Like you're just waiting for someone to reveal you as an impostor? If so, you're not alone. Imposter syndrome is a pervasive struggle that affects people from all walks of life, leaving them feeling inadequate and undeserving of their successes.
As a mental health practitioner and a fellow traveler on this journey, I've witnessed firsthand the devastating impact of imposter syndrome. It's a shadow that looms over our lives, stealing our joy and limiting our potential. But what if I told you that there's a way to heal this deep-seated self-doubt? A path that invites you to see yourself through the lens of your soul, recognizing your innate worth and the deeper purpose of your experiences.
I remember the first time I truly felt like a fraud. I had just accomplished something I had worked for years to achieve. I stood there, clutching the evidence of my success (the degree, the promotion, the recognition), and all I could think was, How did I fool them into thinking I’m good enough? My heart pounded as a quiet but insistent voice whispered, You don’t really belong here. You’re not enough. And sooner or later, they’re going to figure it out.
Maybe you’ve felt that same sinking feeling, the sense that no matter how hard you try, no matter how much you achieve, it’s just a matter of time before the truth comes out. That you aren’t really qualified, that you aren’t as good as people think you are, that you’re only pretending to be capable, and one day someone is going to uncover the truth. This is the quiet agony of imposter syndrome, the belief that your success is not a reflection of your worth or ability but instead the result of luck, timing, or other people’s mistaken perception of you.
But what if I told you that this belief, this feeling of being an imposter, has nothing to do with your capabilities or your accomplishments? What if it’s not even about the roles you play or the recognition you receive? What if imposter syndrome is not about what you’ve done, but about a deeper misunderstanding of who you are?
We live in a world that defines us by what we achieve. From a young age, we are measured by our grades, our performance, our productivity, and our success. We are taught that our value comes from what we produce, how well we meet expectations, and how others perceive us. It’s no wonder that even when we succeed, we feel hollow, because we’ve tied our sense of self to things that are inherently fragile and impermanent.
But underneath all of that, the accomplishments, the failures, the praise, and the criticism, there is something unchanging. Beneath the roles you play and the masks you wear, there exists a spark of consciousness, a radiant light of being that is whole, worthy, and complete simply because it exists. You are not your achievements, your failures, or your status. You are a living soul, a divine spark of creation, and nothing you accomplish or fail to accomplish can ever change that.
Imposter syndrome arises when we forget this truth, when we lose sight of our inherent worth and confuse our identity with the shifting, temporary roles we play in the world. We mistake the mask for the self, the performance for the person. And when the performance falters, or even when it succeeds, we feel exposed and unworthy because we have forgotten that who we are is not defined by what we do.
In Eastern traditions, the concept of dharma teaches us that life is not about proving our worth but about expressing our true nature. The great spiritual teachers remind us that life is not a performance; it’s a process of unfolding, a sacred act of creation. When we align with this truth, we stop measuring ourselves by external standards and begin to trust the deeper current of life that flows through us.
The purpose of this book is not to teach you how to “overcome” imposter syndrome in the traditional sense, by achieving more or building confidence through success. Instead, it’s about guiding you back to the truth of who you are beneath the mask. It’s about recognizing that your worth is not something that can be earned or lost. It’s about learning to trust the unfolding of your life, knowing that success and failure are both part of the sacred process of becoming.
This book will invite you to step beyond the illusion of accomplishment-based worth and into the deeper reality of soul-based being. You’ll learn how the ancient spiritual principles of karma (the law of cause and effect) and dharma (your soul’s true path) can free you from the need for external validation. Through the lens of the four Purusharthas, dharma (purpose), artha (material success), kama (joy), and moksha (spiritual liberation), you’ll discover how to create a life that feels authentic, meaningful, and aligned with your true essence.
You’ll also learn how to navigate the practical side of imposter syndrome, how to quiet the inner critic, stop comparing yourself to others, and communicate with confidence and authenticity. But more than that, you’ll begin to understand that your value is not tied to any of these things. You’ll begin to feel the deep peace that comes from knowing that you are already enough, simply because you exist.
Healing from imposter syndrome is not about becoming more successful or more confident, it’s about returning to the truth of who you are. It’s about realizing that you don’t have to prove anything to anyone. You are a soul, a spark of light, a vessel for the creative energy of the universe. Success and failure are just waves on the surface of the ocean, but beneath it all, you are the stillness, the depth, the quiet power of the ocean itself.
By the end of this book, you won’t need to “convince” yourself that you are worthy, you will know it. You will have reclaimed your power, not by becoming more or doing more, but by realizing that you are already whole. And from that place of knowing, you will be able to create, contribute, and connect, not from a place of fear or striving, but from a peaceful certainty that you are enough.
In ""The Light Beneath the Mask,"" we'll explore a transformative approach to overcoming imposter syndrome by tapping into the wisdom of your soul. This isn't about quick fixes or superficial confidence-boosting techniques. It's about embarking on a journey of self-discovery, peeling back the layers of your outer mask to uncover the radiant truth within.
Throughout these pages, we'll delve into the psychological roots of imposter syndrome, examining how it manifests in our careers, relationships, and personal growth. But we'll also venture beyond the conventional understanding, exploring how the ancient teachings of yoga, meditation, and the four Purushartas can illuminate our path to healing.
You see, when we view ourselves through the eyes of our soul, we begin to recognize that our worth is not defined by our achievements or failures. We are not the roles we play or the masks we wear. Beneath it all, we are living, conscious beings, sparks of light on an evolutionary journey.
As we navigate the chapters ahead, we'll discover how embracing this soul perspective can liberate us from the grip of imposter syndrome. We'll learn to cultivate self-acceptance, to view our experiences as opportunities for growth, and to find joy in the present moment without attachment to outcomes.
Whether you're an adult grappling with self-doubt in your career, a young adult navigating the challenges of finding your place in the world, or a senior reflecting on a lifetime of experiences, this book is an invitation to reclaim your true self. It's a reminder that you are not alone in this struggle and that healing is possible.
So, my dear reader, I invite you to join me on this transformative journey. Together, we'll explore the depths of our being, unmasking the light that has always resided within. With each turn of the page, you'll discover tools, insights, and practices to help you embrace your authentic self and live a life guided by your soul's wisdom.
Are you ready to step into the light beneath the mask? To release the shackles of self-doubt and claim your rightful place in this world? Then let's begin this adventure together, one soul to another, as we embark on the path of healing and self-discovery. So, take a breath. Let the mask slip away. It’s time to meet the light beneath it.
Awakening to the Light Within
""We are not human beings having a spiritual experience. We are spiritual beings having a human experience.""
— Pierre Teilhard de Chardin
What if everything you’ve been taught about who you are is only a fraction of the truth? What if your identity, the roles you play, the achievements you strive for, the labels you wear, is not the full picture of who you are, but merely the surface of a much deeper and more luminous reality?
You are not your career.
You are not your successes or failures.
You are not your relationships, your titles, or your reputation.
You are a spark of light, an eternal consciousness moving through the tapestry of existence. Beneath the shifting circumstances of your life, beneath the pressures and expectations of modern life, beneath the doubts and insecurities of the mind, there exists a steady, radiant presence, your true Self.
This is the truth the ancient sages and mystics have whispered through the ages: You are not the mask you wear. You are the light beneath it.
In the quiet spaces between thoughts, in the stillness of your breath, you can feel it, the awareness that you are not merely a body or a personality moving through the world; you are consciousness itself, infinite and whole. And that consciousness is not fragile or dependent on success. It does not shrink under failure or inflate under praise. It simply is, vast, eternal, and whole.
And yet, we live in a world that trains us to forget this truth.
From the time we are young, we are taught to measure our worth through achievement, grades, performance, recognition and approval. We are conditioned to believe that success means we are worthy, and failure means we are lacking. We are trained to seek validation from the outside world rather than from the inner light of our being.
It’s no wonder that so many of us feel like imposters, even when we succeed. Because we have confused our identity with the fragile, ever-changing conditions of the material world. We have come to believe that our value is something that must be earned or maintained through constant effort.
But what if that’s not true?
What if your worth has never been tied to what you do, but to the simple fact that you are alive?
What if your true nature is not defined by achievement, but by the boundless essence of your consciousness/soul?
The ancient spiritual traditions of the East and West have long held that life is not a performance, it is an unfolding. In the mystical traditions of the West, from the Hermetic teachings of ancient Egypt and Greece to the wisdom of the Kabbalah and the contemplative paths of Christian mysticism, teach that life is a sacred process of awakening to the divine within. The alchemists saw the soul’s journey as a process of inner transformation, turning base elements into spiritual gold. The Gnostics and early Christian mystics believed that true knowledge comes not from external achievement, but from direct communion with the divine spark within.
These Western traditions, like their Eastern counterparts, remind us that the path is not about striving, but about remembering, peeling back the layers of illusion to reveal the light of the soul beneath. In Vedanta and Buddhist philosophy, the concept of dharma teaches that we are not here to ""succeed"" or ""prove"" ourselves, we are here to express our true nature. We are here to evolve, to create, and to awaken to the truth of our being.
According to the teachings of the Eightfold Path, congruent action, intention, and speech do not come from trying to force ourselves into a mold or meet a set of external expectations. They arise naturally when we are aligned with our true nature, when we are living from the depth of our being rather than the surface of the pseudo self (the transient personality).
In the Vedic tradition, the four Purusharthas — dharma (purpose), artha (material success), kama (joy), and moksha (spiritual liberation) are not goals to be chased. They are pathways to alignment with the soul’s unfolding journey. They are expressions of the truth that life is not about ""getting it right"" it's about allowing the deeper intelligence of the universe to move through you, as you.
And this is where true freedom lies.
Not in mastering life, but in trusting its flow.
Not in controlling outcomes, but in surrendering to the creative process.
When you understand this, imposter syndrome begins to dissolve, not because you’ve convinced yourself that you’re “good enough,” but because you no longer measure your worth by the temporary conditions of success or failure. You begin to see that both success and failure are passing waves on the surface of the ocean, and you are the ocean itself.
This book is not about building your confidence through accomplishment or positive thinking. It’s about helping you return to the truth of who you already are. It’s about peeling back the layers of conditioning and performance to uncover the steady light of consciousness beneath.
Through the lens of Eastern wisdom, you’ll learn how to release the need for validation from the outside world and begin to cultivate a sense of inner peace and alignment that is unshakable. You’ll explore the deeper spiritual laws of karma (cause and effect) and dharma (your soul’s path) and discover how to live in harmony with the creative flow of life. You’ll learn how to set boundaries with grace, how to communicate with authenticity, and how to release the fear of judgment and failure.
But more than that, you’ll come to know (deeply and without doubt) that you are already enough.
You don’t have to prove yourself.
You don’t have to earn your place in the world.
You don’t have to chase success to be worthy.
You are whole.
You are light.
You are consciousness itself, and nothing you do or fail to do can change that.
This is the path of reclaiming your power, not by becoming more, but by remembering who you already are. When you move and create from a place of wholeness, what might be possible for you?
Motivated by inspiration and love, would you be more enthusiastic about contributing your unique vision to the world? Perhaps your true potential could shine through when you no longer feel the need to ""prove that you are good enough"". As you realize the difference between living from the fear of other's expectations, to the abundant love and creativity of your true nature, life takes on a new quality!
By the end of this journey, you will no longer need to ""convince"" yourself that you belong, you will simply know. From that place of knowing, you will be able to create, contribute, and experience life with freedom and peace, not because you need to succeed to be worthy, but because you understand that you are already whole. As you recognize this wholeness within yourself, perhaps you will begin to see it in everyone around you, learning to encourage us all to express our true potential.
The light beneath the mask is waiting for you.
It always has been.
Chapter 1
Understanding Imposter Syndrome
""Go confidently in the direction of your dreams. Live the life you have imagined.""
— Henry David Thoreau
It's a feeling you might know all too well. You're sitting in a meeting, and someone praises your hard work, yet instead of feeling proud, you feel a knot in your stomach. You worry they’ll soon discover you’re not as capable as they think. This isn’t just a passing anxiety, it’s a glimpse into the pervasive world of imposter syndrome. In 1978 the term was coined by psychologists Pauline Rose Clance and Suzanne Imes, imposter syndrome is a psychological pattern where people question their achievements and live with the ongoing worry of being unveiled as an imposter. It doesn’t matter if you’re a seasoned professional or a student just starting out; this feeling can sneak up on anyone, irrespective of their achievements or qualifications.
At its core, imposter syndrome is characterized by an inability to internalize success and feel your innate dignity and self respect. You might attribute your accomplishments to luck rather than your skills or hard work. This doubt can cast a long shadow over your career, relationships, and personal growth. It's not uncommon for high-achieving individuals to feel this way. In fact, research shows that around 70% of people may experience imposter syndrome at some point in their lives. This phenomenon isn't limited to one profession or demographic. Whether you're a high-powered executive, a healthcare professional, or an artist, the feeling of being an impostor can strike.
Take, for example, the experience of renowned actress Viola Davis. Despite her accolades and success, she has spoken openly about her struggles with self-doubt and feeling like she’s not enough. Davis's honesty sheds light on how widespread these feelings are. Even those who seem to have it all together can harbor doubts about their worthiness. The burden of sustaining a semblance of competence can be daunting, propelling individuals into a state of silence. Many fear that admitting their insecurities will lead to judgment or dismissal. This silence can be damaging, isolating individuals and perpetuating a cycle of shame.
The stigma attached to vulnerability makes discussing imposter syndrome challenging. Cultural norms often equate admitting weakness with failure, discouraging open conversations about self-doubt. Yet, this silence can have profound consequences, affecting mental health and professional growth. Without addressing these feelings, anxiety and depression may take root, hindering one's ability to perform and thrive.
Awareness is the beginning of creating a new healthier pattern. By acknowledging the existence of imposter syndrome, we open the door to understanding and healing. Recognizing that these feelings are common and not a personal failing can be liberating. It allows us to challenge the narrative that we’re alone in our struggle. As we explore this book, we’ll delve deeper into the roots of imposter syndrome and its impact. We'll uncover how societal pressures and cultural expectations shape our perceptions of success and worthiness. By bringing these influences to light, we can start to remove the obstacles that impede our growth.
Through self awareness, we’ll learn to see beyond the roles we play and the accolades we chase. We’ll come to appreciate our inherent value as living, conscious beings. This perspective shift is not just about overcoming imposter syndrome; it’s about embracing our true selves with compassion and understanding. By fostering awareness and engaging in supportive dialogues, we create a community where vulnerability is met with empathy, not judgment. Together, we can challenge the misconceptions surrounding this condition and support one another in our pursuit of authenticity and fulfillment.
In this chapter, we’ll explore the hidden struggle of imposter syndrome and the importance of emotional awareness in overcoming it. We’ll uncover how pervasive this phenomenon is across different demographics, highlighting the need for open conversations and supportive communities. Through personal stories and insights, we’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to navigate and heal from these feelings of inadequacy. This journey begins with acknowledging our shared experiences and finding strength in vulnerability.
1.1 Recognizing the Symptoms and Patterns
""If you hear a voice within you say, ‘You cannot paint,’ then by all means paint, and that voice will be silenced.""
— Vincent van Gogh
Imposter syndrome often begins as a whisper of insecurity that can spiral into a relentless echo of doubt. Imagine waking up each morning with a nagging feeling that your successes are a fluke, that any moment now, someone will uncover your inadequacy. This chronic self-doubt is like a shadow that lingers, irrespective of how brightly your achievements shine. You might find yourself questioning your abilities, convinced that every accolade or acknowledgment is misplaced. This pervasive insecurity frequently leads to a fear of both failure and success. You might wonder, ""If I fail, everyone will finally see I'm not capable,"" or conversely, ""If I succeed, the expectations will only get higher, and soon I'll be exposed."" It's a paralyzing paradox that can keep you stuck in a loop of anxiety and hesitation.
One of the most telling patterns of imposter syndrome is the cycle. It's a dance between over-preparation and temporary relief. Picture this: you receive a new project at work. Instead of feeling confident in your abilities, you dive into overdrive, over-preparing to ensure everything is perfect. When you receive praise for your work, there's a fleeting sense of relief, but it quickly dissipates. You attribute the success to your exhaustive preparation, not your skills or talents. This cycle perpetuates as you continue to equate worth with effort, never truly internalizing your accomplishments. Over time, this relentless pattern can lead to burnout, as the constant pressure to prove oneself takes its toll.
It's important to differentiate between imposter syndrome and healthy self-doubt. Everyone experiences moments of uncertainty, those times when you question if you're making the right decision or if your work is up to par. Healthy self awareness can be a catalyst for growth, prompting you to learn, adapt, and improve. It becomes problematic when it morphs into a paralyzing belief that you're fundamentally unworthy. Imposter syndrome isn't just an occasional feeling; it's a persistent pattern that can significantly impact your career and relationships. Whereas healthy self awareness encourages reflection and learning, imposter feelings create a barrier to accepting success and celebrating achievements.
Different professions have their own unique flavors of imposter syndrome. In academic settings, for instance, the fear of intellectual inadequacy can loom large. Students and educators alike might feel pressured to constantly demonstrate competence, fearing that any sign of struggle will expose them as frauds. In corporate environments, the pressure to meet unrealistic expectations can be overwhelming. The fast-paced, competitive nature of these settings can amplify feelings of inadequacy. Professionals might find themselves working late into the night, striving to meet impossible standards and prove their worth.
Understanding these symptoms and patterns is the first step.

By identifying these signs, you grant yourself the power to contest these beliefs and pursue support. You're not alone in feeling this way, and acknowledging the symptoms is the first step toward recovery and self-growth. By recognizing the signs, you empower yourself to challenge these beliefs and seek support. You're not alone in this experience, and acknowledging the symptoms can open the door to healing and growth.
1.2 How Imposter Syndrome Manifests in Different Contexts
""Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.""
— Ralph Waldo Emerson
In the professional world, imposter syndrome can subtly weave its way into our daily lives, affecting everything from our career choices to our satisfaction at work. Imagine standing on the brink of a career opportunity, a promotion that you’ve worked tirelessly toward. Instead of feeling eager, you feel a creeping reluctance. The fear of stepping into a new role and potentially failing to meet expectations holds you back. This hesitation isn't about lacking skills; it’s about the internal battle with self-doubt. The reluctance to seek out promotions or new opportunities can be paralyzing.
Over time, this can lead you to stagnate in your current position, unable to advance or explore your full potential. Even while you remain in place, the pressure to constantly prove your worth can drive you to overwork, masking perceived inadequacies with long hours and relentless perfectionism. This overworking doesn’t necessarily stem from ambition but from the fear that if you stop pushing, someone might notice the cracks and expose you as a fraud.
In academic settings, the weight of imposter syndrome is often felt by both students and educators alike. Students, especially, are caught in a whirlwind of expectations. They fear being exposed as less competent than their peers, and this fear can manifest in endless hours of studying, not necessarily to learn but to avoid being “found out.” The pressure to achieve perfection can overshadow the joy of learning, transforming education into a battleground of anxiety.
Educators are not immune either. The need to maintain a facade of expertise can lead to immense pressure, as they strive to live up to the expectations of students, colleagues, and themselves. The fear of making a mistake or admitting a gap in knowledge can be daunting, keeping them from engaging fully with their roles.

Preface
Tears are often seen as a symbol of sorrow, yet they hold a far deeper significance. They emerge in moments of profound joy, unbearable grief, quiet reflection, and even unexpected laughter. The Color of Their Tears is a journey through the shared human experience, revealing how emotions—though deeply personal—connect people across cultures, time, and circumstances.
This book explores life’s defining moments, from love and loss to resilience and renewal. Each chapter presents a different story, drawing upon universal themes that highlight the commonalities of human existence. Some accounts are intimate and deeply personal, while others recount historical events that have shaped collective memory. Whether rooted in personal relationships, natural disasters, or moments of self-discovery, these narratives reflect the emotional spectrum that defines humanity.
Beyond individual experiences, this book serves as a reminder that emotions are not bound by language or geography. The struggles and triumphs of one person may resonate with another, even if their lives are vastly different. In times of division, stories such as these serve as a testament to the shared threads of empathy and understanding that weave people together.
Each chapter is crafted to evoke thought and emotion, encouraging readers to reflect on their own journeys and the moments that have shaped them. The hope is that through these pages, readers will find echoes of their own lives and gain a deeper appreciation for the connections that exist beneath the surface of everyday existence.
The Color of Their Tears is not just a collection of stories—it is an exploration of what it means to be human.

Introduction
""The human heart, at its core, knows no distinction of wealth, race, or background. In the face of life's most fragile moments, we are simply human.""
— Anonymous
They say the first breath of a newborn is a miracle—a single, peaceful transition from the unknown to the known. For most of us, it’s a moment of joy uncomplicated by life’s hurdles. It is marked by a first cry, a mother’s tired smile, and a father’s eyes filled with tears. It is an unmistakable sound that fills the room with a wonderful sensation of completion, as if the world has stopped to notice something pure and lovely.
But for me, the sound of a newborn’s first cry has always carried a deeper meaning. Each cry is a delicate combination of resilience and vulnerability. It is the sound of a tiny human, against all odds, pushing through the dark, fighting to take that first breath. However, in spite of that wail, there is always a voice of doubt—will this baby be okay? Will this be enough? The future is unwritten, delicate, and uncertain. The cry is not just a victory over silence but a question, a plea for assurance that this tiny new life will be safe.
And then there's the loss, which is constantly present and lurking beneath the surface. A newborn's first cry is often a reminder that life is both beautiful and risky. Every breath a baby takes is a small victory, but it is also a reminder that all life is short and there is no assurance of a happy ending. In those cries, I hear the echoes of parents who have already lost so much, whose hopes are distorted with fear, and whose joy is guarded by the knowledge that nothing in life is certain.
After over twenty years as a physician, my life has become a collection of moments, each influenced by the emotions of families who find themselves at the mercy of tiny, delicate beginnings. Over the years, I've realized that this role—this calling—is more than a career; it's a journey through the most intense feelings of human emotion. It's a place where joy and sadness, hope and despair, are felt with an intensity that words cannot express.
The NICU, or the neonatal intensive care unit, is unlike any other place in a hospital. It’s a room where time stops, where a heartbeat, breath, tremor, or cry can alter everything. You quickly learn that no amount of expertise can prepare you for the volatility of these lives. And no title, no amount of years in the field can shield you from the weight of a parent’s cries when their hope begins to fray. Nothing on earth can teach you how to handle these delicate moments teetering between hope and heartbreak.
The situation shows you instantly that no matter how extensive your skill is, it has limitations. You can be a doctor with all the knowledge and training, but in these moments, those things fade in comparison to the raw, vulnerable truth of human life. The tiny hands that grasp your finger, the quiet sobs of parents who can’t leave the incubator for fear of missing something critical, the strained smiles of mothers and fathers whose hopes are chained to machines and monitors—no amount of academic preparation can prepare you for the depth of this human experience. It is here, in this fragile space between life and death, that the real work of being a doctor begins. It's more than simply medicine; it's about being present, understanding the significance of each moment, and realizing that these moments, no matter how tiny, are meaningful.
As a physician, you cannot avoid the emotional impact of watching a parent's hope crumble. The tears that fall when the prognosis is unknown, the quiet desperation that fills a room when the heartbeat of a baby falters—these are the moments that cannot be navigated with clinical detachment. A doctor's duty is more than just providing medical solutions; it is also to walk with families through their darkest times, sharing their fears and bringing whatever light they can. No matter how long you've been in the field or how many lives you've saved or lost, each new case exposes you to the fragile nature of life. The true fragility of life is shown in these moments when we are torn between hope and heartbreak.
There are no guarantees; there are no promises that everything will be okay. You can’t protect families from the pain of loss, nor can you predict the joy of recovery. All you can do is offer your expertise, your compassion, and your presence. These are the delicate moments that define life in medicine—moments that stay with you long after the monitors have gone quiet, long after the families have left the hospital. In this book, I share stories based on years of witnessing these connections, trying to clarify universal truths about life, resilience, and the bond of love wherein all cultural, linguistic, and economic divisions disappear.
I have watched families from every walk of life who might never have crossed paths come together in this delicate situation. I’ve seen a grandmother reach for a stranger's hand, bound together by the shared hope that both babies would live to see another day. It’s humbling, reminding us that while the rest is divided, our similarities come through.
I come from a family that values people deeply. My father, a pastor, spent countless hours comforting families through grief and guiding them through life’s challenges. As a child, I accompanied him to funerals, where I saw, again and again, the unity in sorrow that binds us, no matter the background or belief. My mother, an educator, was dedicated to educating young minds. Both taught me the value of compassion, respect, and the quiet strength it takes to support others in their most vulnerable moments. My work has only increased my appreciation for these qualities, and each day in that place has reminded me of the humanity that unites us all.
My birth in 1968, which coincided with a national disaster, is a haunting memory. My parents, who were happy to have their second child, learned of Robert F. Kennedy's assassination shortly afterward, and their cries of pleasure turned to tears of despair. I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama, in a town influenced by the Civil Rights Movement, where pain and bigotry were all too real. The 1963 explosion that killed the Four Little Girls changed the nation's collective heart, marking a rare time when people united across racial and societal lines. This shared pain revealed a significant truth: our tears may be colorless, but their reasons say everything about who we are.
One memorable incident that stands out involves a young couple new to this country. They arrived with their premature baby, who was fighting for his life. They had little money and possibly fewer hopes than others. The baby was so tiny that he could be held in my hand. Day after day, I watched the mother sit by his incubator; her face was like a silent portrait of dedication, her posture frozen with fear and love. She didn’t speak English, and yet everything she felt was clear. It was a moment that reminded me that love, hope, and worry are feelings not limited by language or country; they are universal.
In my years of practice, I have held newborns as small as a 16 oz bottle of water, each a reminder of how delicate yet tough life can be. I've experienced the tremendous burden of a parent's sadness as their child breathes their final breath. I've also seen families walk out of the hospital, exhausted but delighted, holding a healthy child in their arms. These experiences leave an everlasting impact on who I am, not just as a doctor but as a human being.
I have learned lessons that no textbook could have taught me. I've understood that resilience can be both quiet and strong, that hope can exist in the darkest times, and that love—raw, desperate, overwhelming—motivates everyone. It has shown me the color of tears in countless shades: joy, despair, relief, fear. I invite you to step into my world and see what I’ve seen. By doing so, perhaps you’ll understand just a fraction of what it means to hold a life so fragile in your hands.
This book is not a story of science, medicine, or even miracles. It’s about the raw and unfiltered emotions we experience when we’re vulnerable. Understanding the language of these vulnerable moments allows us to approach each other with greater empathy and compassion. It’s about how fragile we can be as humans.
My call to you is this: let these stories remind you that we are all more connected than we realize. Let them inspire you to reach across divides, offer kindness to those you may not understand, and honor the fragile beauty of life we all share.
Because in the end, we all carry the same dreams, the same fears, and yes, the same color of tears.
Chapter 1: First Love's Return
""Love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward together in the same direction. It is not only by sharing joys that love grows but by facing life’s struggles hand in hand.""
— Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
Michael, 38, sat at one of the small, round tables lining the edge of the Grand Ballroom at the Boston Marriott, nursing a glass of water that he hadn’t touched in over ten minutes. The elegant ballroom was alive with laughter and conversation, the sound of clinking glasses and distant jazz music weaving through the air. Former classmates mingled and gestured animatedly as they recounted half-remembered stories from their teenage years, but Michael barely noticed any of it.
Instead, his dark brown eyes wandered across the room, scanning every cluster of people for one face in particular. He adjusted the knot of his silk tie, his fingers tugging at the smooth fabric—a nervous habit he hadn’t been able to shake since high school debate tournaments. The light blue tie was one he had chosen carefully, its color subtly complementing the crisp charcoal-gray suit that was tailored to fit his tall, athletic frame. At six feet even, Michael had broad shoulders that gave him an air of effortless confidence, but tonight, that confidence faltered.
Michael’s high school sweetheart, Sarah, was the reason he was here, the reason his chest felt tight and his palms clammy despite the cool temperature of the room. Would she come? She had said she’d be here, but Michael hadn’t heard from her in five days. Five long, restless days of silence that made him wonder if he’d somehow misread their last phone call.
The past year had been chaotic for both of them. Michael’s demanding schedule as a corporate tax attorney at Morrison & Sterling kept him buried in spreadsheets, client calls, and courtroom appearances in San Francisco. Meanwhile, Sarah was a 37-year-old who spent her days teaching sixth grade at St. Mary’s Academy in Boston, juggling preteens and stacks of essays. The time difference made staying in touch harder than either of them had expected.
Their phone calls had become shorter, and text messages were exchanged less often. Michael hadn’t admitted it to himself until now, but the growing distance between them, both physical and emotional, scared him. He feared it was becoming too wide to bridge.
Michael glanced at his watch. Half an hour had passed since he arrived—half an hour of searching the crowd, of feeling the beginnings of doubt creep into his mind. He shook his head and stood abruptly, smoothing the lapels of his jacket.
“I need a drink,” he muttered to himself as he headed toward the bar.
The bar was a polished mahogany masterpiece, gleaming under the soft glow of the chandeliers. Michael ordered a classic gin and tonic, his voice low as he leaned against the counter. The bartender nodded and began mixing the drink, the clinking of ice cubes the only sound in the momentary lull.
But Michael’s mind was elsewhere, replaying their last conversation. She had been tired that night, her voice soft and distracted as she told him about her students and a particularly chaotic day at school. He’d asked her if she was still planning to come to the reunion, and she’d said yes, of course she would. But now, with the silence of the past five days, doubt gnawed at him.
Just as the bartender set the drink down in front of him, Michael felt someone bump into his arm. The movement jolted him slightly, and he turned instinctively, ready to apologize.
“Oops,” a familiar voice said, accompanied by a soft laugh.
Michael froze. His eyes widened as he took in the woman standing before him.
“Surprise, babe,” Sarah O’Connor said, grinning up at him.
She looked stunning. Her green eyes sparkled with the same playful energy that had captivated him all those years ago. For a moment, Michael couldn’t speak. His heart leaped into his throat, and all he could do was stare.
“Sarah,” he finally managed, his voice catching slightly.
She laughed, her hand brushing his arm. “Did you really think I wasn’t coming?”
Before he could answer, she stepped forward and wrapped her arms around him. Michael pulled her close, his arms circling her waist as he held her tightly. He closed his eyes, inhaling the faint floral scent of her perfume, and felt the tension in his chest begin to melt away.
“I missed you,” she murmured into his shoulder.
“I missed you, too,” he said softly.
When she finally pulled back, her eyes searched his. “So, what’s good here? Or do I need to ask the bartender what the Michael Chen special is these days?”
Michael laughed, feeling lighter than he had in weeks.
The music shifted to a slower tune. The band began to play At Last. Couples drifted onto the dance floor, their movements slow and unhurried. The warm lighting of the ballroom softened the edges of the room. The soft glow of the chandeliers cast a nostalgic spell over everyone.
Sarah grabbed Michael’s hand, her fingers warm and sure against his. “Come on,” she said, her voice teasing as she tugged him toward the center of the room.
Michael hesitated for a moment, then let her lead him. His lips curved into a small smile. “You always have to take the lead, don’t you?”
“You love it,” she said, her grin wide and unapologetic.
Of course, he did.
Once on the dance floor, Michael placed his hands gently on her waist. His touch was deliberate, almost reverent. It was as though he couldn’t quite believe she was here in front of him. She looped her arms around his neck. Her green eyes met his, and the rest of the room faded into the background. The familiar notes of the song played on. Laughter from the other couples and the clinking of glasses melted into a distant hum. In that moment, there was only her.
They began to sway to the music, and before long, Sarah leaned in slightly. Her voice was soft, barely louder than a whisper. “Do you remember the library?”
Michael’s lips curved again into a small smile. “How could I forget? You marched up to me like you owned the place.”
“I was friendly,” she protested, her eyes twinkling.
“You were relentless,” he teased, his smile widening.
Sarah laughed. Her head tilted back slightly, and the sound bubbled out of her. It was a sound Michael hadn’t realized he had missed until now. She rested her head briefly against his chest. Her laughter sent warmth coursing through him, easing a tension he hadn’t known he carried.
“I couldn’t let you sit there with your nose buried in The Scarlet Letter for another minute,” Sarah said. She looked down at her hands for a moment. “I mean, who voluntarily rereads Nathaniel Hawthorne for fun?”
“I wasn’t rereading it,” Michael countered. He shook his head, pretending to be exasperated. “I was making notes for the final paper.”
“Exactly my point,” Sarah said with a grin, looking up at him.
They laughed together at the memory. The years between them felt smaller, the weight of time lifting. For a moment, it felt like they were back in Mrs. Patterson’s AP English class, their younger selves teasing and stealing glances.
Michael held her a little closer. Beneath his lighthearted teasing, a quiet fear lingered. The thought nagged at him, though he pushed it down. He was scared—scared that he might lose her someday.
It had started with the library, of course. Sarah had been bold, unafraid to plop down across from him and break the silence he so carefully cultivated. She’d teased him relentlessly about his neat handwriting, calling it “textbook perfect,” and he, in turn, had teased her about her habit of leaving her essays unfinished until the night before they were due.
They’d spent hours in that library, hidden among the rows of dusty books. At first, their conversations had been about school and assignments. But then they became about everything else—dreams, fears, the kind of open-hearted honesty that only exists in the fleeting moments of youth.
By the time junior prom rolled around, their friendship had become something more. Michael could still remember the way Sarah had looked that night, her deep-blue dress swaying as she danced, her auburn hair catching the soft glow of the string lights that hung across the gymnasium.
It was behind that gymnasium, away from the crowd and the noise, where they shared their first kiss. Michael had been nervous, his hands trembling slightly as he reached for hers. Sarah had smiled at him, her green eyes bright and fearless, and before he could second-guess himself, she had leaned in, her lips brushing softly against his.
“I kissed you first,” she teased now, her voice breaking through the memory as they swayed on the dance floor.
Michael chuckled, his hand tightening slightly on her waist. “Only because I was too nervous to make the first move.”
“You’re welcome,” Sarah said, grinning.
Their romance had been as intense as it was brief. By the time summer ended, they both knew what was coming. Michael had been accepted to Stanford University, and his parents’ dream for him was finally coming to fruition while Sarah was staying in Boston to attend Boston College.
Their goodbye at Logan Airport was one of the hardest moments of Michael’s life. He could still see Sarah standing there, her arms crossed tightly over her chest as she tried to hold back tears.
“Don’t forget about me, okay?” she had said, her voice trembling despite the brave smile on her lips.
“Never,” Michael had replied, his throat tight.
He had hugged her one last time, inhaling the faint floral scent of her shampoo, before walking away. He didn’t look back—not because he didn’t want to, but because he couldn’t bear to see her cry.
The dance ended after an hour or so, and Sarah and Michael made their way to one of the quieter corners of the ballroom, settling into a small table tucked near the far wall.
“You know,” Sarah began, taking a sip of the wine she’d left behind earlier, “Mrs. Patterson would be horrified if she knew we spent more time flirting in her class than paying attention to The Great Gatsby.”
Michael laughed, leaning back slightly in his chair. “I think we both did fine on the final exam. Didn’t you get an A-minus?”
“Yeah, and that minus haunts me to this day,” Sarah quipped, though the smile on her face betrayed her lack of seriousness.
The conversation shifted easily from one memory to the next, each one drawing them closer together. They talked about their favorite spot at Joe’s Ice Cream Parlor, the little corner table they used to claim after school. Michael’s go-to order, pistachio ice cream, became a running joke between them, with Sarah insisting it “tasted like cardboard.”
“I still can’t believe they tore it down,” Sarah said, shaking her head.
“They replaced it with oat milk lattes,” Michael replied, his tone mock-serious. “What’s happening to the world?”
Sarah laughed, her green eyes sparkling, and Michael felt his heart ache in the best way possible.
***
Their reconnection at the reunion had been the spark, but what followed was nothing short of a whirlwind. In the weeks after that night, Michael and Sarah quickly fell into a rhythm that felt natural. Late-night phone calls turned into weekend visits. Michael flew to Boston whenever he could steal a few days away from work. They spent hours exploring the city together. They walked along the Charles River, revisited old haunts from their teenage years, and created new memories to layer over the old ones.
It didn’t take long for them to realize this was more than a rekindling of old flames. It was different. It felt deeper. They were no longer teenagers fumbling their way through first love. They were adults who had lived, grown, and changed. Somehow, despite everything, they fit together better than before.
By the time December rolled around, Michael knew he couldn’t wait any longer. He wanted to ask Sarah to marry him in a way that felt timeless, intimate, and as special as their love story. After weeks of planning, he decided on a place that perfectly reflected the magic of their journey back to one another.
He stood on the rooftop terrace of a boutique hotel in downtown Boston, the cold December air biting at his cheeks as he adjusted the small lanterns he’d strung along the railing. The terrace overlooked the city skyline, the buildings glittering like a sea of stars against the clear night sky. The faint hum of the city below was muffled by the height, leaving the rooftop shrouded in a quiet intimacy that felt worlds away from the bustling streets.
He checked his watch for the third time, his heart pounding. Sarah was on her way. He had told her it was just a casual evening, a chance to unwind after dinner. She didn’t know what was waiting for her up here.
In the center of the terrace stood a small table set with a bottle of her favorite wine, two glasses, and a plate of macarons from the bakery where she always stopped on her way to work. Around the table, Michael had arranged a scattering of candles, their soft light flickering in the cold wind. Nearby, a portable speaker played the soft, familiar notes of La Vie En Rose, a song Sarah had once joked sounded like it belonged to another world.
When he heard the creak of the rooftop door, Michael’s breath caught. Sarah stepped out, her auburn hair catching the light from the lanterns. She wore a long navy coat, her red scarf wrapped snugly around her neck, and her cheeks were flushed pink from the cold.
“What is this?” she asked, her green eyes wide with curiosity as she took in the scene.
Michael smiled, his hands stuffed into the pockets of his gray peacoat to hide the way they were trembling. “Just thought I’d surprise you.”
Sarah laughed softly, shaking her head as she approached him. “This is... wow, Michael. It’s beautiful.”
He reached for her hand, his fingers warm despite the cold. “You’re beautiful,” he said quietly, his voice steady despite the storm of nerves swirling inside him.
Sarah tilted her head, her smile softening. “You’re being unusually romantic tonight. Should I be worried?”
Michael let out a nervous laugh, then guided her toward the table. But before she could sit, he stepped back, dropping to one knee on the cold, tiled floor.
Sarah froze, her hand flying to her mouth.
“Sarah O’Connor,” Michael began, his voice low but steady, “you are my everything. You’ve always been. From the moment you walked into that library and ruined my perfectly quiet life, you’ve had my heart.”
Tears welled in Sarah’s green eyes, spilling down her cheeks as Michael continued.
“I don’t want to waste another second without you by my side,” he said, pulling a small velvet box from his pocket and flipping it open to reveal a delicate platinum ring with a brilliant round-cut diamond. “Will you marry me?”
For a moment, Sarah didn’t speak. She stared at him, her hand still covering her mouth, and Michael’s heart stopped. Then, with a trembling laugh, she nodded, her voice breaking as she said, “Yes. Yes, of course, yes!”
Michael slipped the ring onto her finger, his hands shaking slightly, then stood and pulled her into his arms. She laughed and cried against his chest, her breath warm against his neck as she whispered, “I love you.”
“I love you, too,” he murmured, pressing a kiss to her hair.
Above them, the stars stretched endlessly into the night, and for the first time in years, Michael felt like the future was something he could reach out and touch.
***
Six months later, on a brisk evening in late December, Michael and Sarah exchanged vows at the Boston Public Garden. The park had been transformed into a winter wonderland. Fresh snow covered the ground, and strings of twinkling lights wrapped around the towering trees. Red lanterns hung from the branches, glowing softly in the cold air.
The ceremony took place beneath an elegant arch made of evergreen branches and white roses. The flowers were dusted lightly with snow. Guests huddled in their seats, wrapped in scarves and blankets, their breath forming clouds in the crisp winter air.
Michael stood at the altar, waiting. His breath caught when Sarah appeared at the end of the aisle—she looked radiant. Her auburn hair was swept into a loose updo, framed by a delicate lace veil. Her long-sleeved wedding gown sparkled faintly in the warm light. Intricate lace details shimmered as she moved. She carried a bouquet of red roses and holly, her gloved hands gripping the stems tightly. Michael could not take his eyes off her.
When their eyes met, everything else disappeared for him. She was his past, his present, and his future.
The ceremony was simple but meaningful. Sarah’s uncle delivered an Irish blessing, his voice warm and steady. He wished the couple joy and prosperity. Michael’s mother, who had once been cautious about the cultural differences between their families, surprised everyone. She recited a traditional Chinese proverb about the strength of unity.
“Love grows stronger when rooted in understanding,” she said, her voice heavy with emotion.
By the time Michael and Sarah exchanged vows, most of the guests were wiping their eyes.
“I, Michael, promise to love you with everything I am for all the days of my life,” Michael said, his voice wavering slightly.
“And I, Sarah, promise to stand by your side, in every season, through every challenge, for as long as we both shall live.”
The officiant smiled and pronounced them husband and wife. Michael lifted Sarah’s veil and kissed her. The guests broke into cheers as snowflakes swirled in the air like confetti. They landed on Sarah’s hair while Michael pulled her close. “We did it,” he whispered.
The reception took place in a nearby greenhouse filled with strings of fairy lights and poinsettias. Michael’s family brought platters of traditional Chinese dishes. The Irish-Catholic guests served corned beef and soda bread in return. Laughter echoed as the two families mingled, warming up to one another. By the end of the night, Michael’s uncle was teaching Sarah’s father how to toast in Mandarin. Sarah’s cousins snapped selfies with Michael’s grandmother.
The day felt like more than just a marriage. It was a blending of traditions, families, and two hearts that had finally found their way back to each other.
***
The decision to pursue IVF was not made lightly.
Michael and Sarah spent the first year of their marriage blissfully optimistic about starting a family. They approached the process with excitement and hope, fueled by the energy of their whirlwind romance. Sarah tracked her ovulation cycles with precision, often waking Michael in the middle of the night when the timing was “just right.”
They joked about giving up caffeine and swapped late-night Chinese takeout for kale salads. At Sarah’s suggestion, they even tried yoga, convinced it might help. They were willing to do anything to increase their chances.
But as the months dragged on, one negative pregnancy test after another stared back at them. Their optimism began to fade. The joy of trying became a routine, and each failure left a sharper sting behind. The unspoken fear between them grew heavier with every passing month.
“Maybe we’re just stressed,” Sarah said one evening, forcing a bright tone. She sat curled up on the couch, her knees pulled to her chest. A cup of peppermint tea sat untouched on the coffee table. “Work has been insane for both of us. Maybe that’s all it is.”
Michael didn’t answer right away. He sat on the floor in front of her, an open laptop balanced on his knees. He pretended to read an article about stress and fertility, but the words blurred together. He couldn’t focus. The weight of her disappointment felt unbearable.
“Maybe,” he said finally, his voice low.
But deep down, they both knew it wasn’t just stress.
The turning point came a year later after Sarah’s doctor suggested they consult a fertility specialist. The recommendation had been delivered gently, with phrases like “sometimes it takes a little extra help” and “it’s better to get answers sooner rather than later.”
But it still stung. Sarah cried that night, curled up on their bed with her face buried in Michael’s shoulder as he rubbed slow circles on her back. “What if it’s me?” she whispered, her voice breaking. “What if I’m the reason we can’t—”
“Stop,” Michael interrupted, his voice firm but kind. He cupped her face in his hands, forcing her to look at him. “This is not your fault. It’s not anyone’s fault. Whatever it is, we’ll figure it out together.”
They made the appointment the next morning.
Walking into the Boston Reproductive Center for the first time felt surreal. The waiting room was sleek and sterile, with muted gray walls, rows of stiff, modern chairs, and a faint chemical smell masked by artificial lavender. A television mounted in the corner played a calming nature documentary, its soft piano soundtrack juxtaposed with slow-motion shots of blooming flowers and baby animals.
Sarah fidgeted with the strap of her bag as they waited, her green eyes darting nervously around the room. Michael sat beside her, his hands folded neatly in his lap, though his jaw was clenched tighter than usual. Neither spoke until their names were called.
Dr. Rachel Goldman, their fertility specialist, was a petite woman in her mid-forties with a no-nonsense air that was softened by her warm smile and intelligent, empathetic eyes. Her short brown hair was streaked with silver at the temples, and she wore a simple gold wedding band that she absently spun around her finger as she talked.
She explained the diagnostic process clearly, walking them through the tests they would both undergo to determine the root of the problem. “Unexplained infertility,” she said a week later when the results came back. Her tone was professional but compassionate as she looked between them. “It means there’s no clear reason why you’re not able to conceive naturally. Your age, your health, and everything on paper look fine. But for some couples, even when everything seems normal, it just... doesn’t happen.”
“So what do we do?” Sarah asked, her voice barely above a whisper.
Dr. Goldman leaned forward, folding her hands on the desk. “There are several options. But in your case, I would recommend in-vitro fertilization. IVF gives us the best chance of success because we can control and monitor every step of the process.”
Michael reached for Sarah’s hand under the desk, squeezing it gently.
The first round of IVF felt like diving into uncharted waters. Sarah endured weeks of hormone injections, blood draws, and ultrasounds. Her body became a canvas for tiny bruises where the needles pierced her skin. Michael learned to administer the nightly shots, his hands steady even when hers trembled.
“It’s fine,” she insisted the first time. She winced as the needle slid beneath her skin. “I’ve got this.”
Michael frowned and pressed the plunger slowly. “We’ve got this,” he said.
When the embryo transfer came, they sat together in a private room. They listened carefully while Dr. Goldman explained the next steps. Sarah closed her eyes and whispered a silent prayer.
The procedure began, and for the next two weeks, they clung to hope. They counted down the days until they could take the pregnancy test. When the results came, it was a faint positive. Dr. Goldman called it a chemical pregnancy. The embryo had implanted briefly but failed to develop.
“It’s common,” Dr. Goldman said during their follow-up appointment. Her voice was calm and gentle. “It doesn’t mean we won’t have success next time.”
Tears spilled down Sarah’s cheeks. Michael held her hand and said nothing. He felt utterly powerless.
The second attempt proved even more challenging. Sarah’s body didn’t respond as well to the medications, and none of the embryos made it to the implantation stage. Michael watched helplessly as the light in Sarah’s eyes dimmed, her laughter growing rarer and her shoulders heavier with each passing day.
By the time they reached the third attempt, the process had drained them both—emotionally, physically, and financially. The treatments had already cost $98,000, forcing them to dip into their savings and take out loans to continue. Michael started taking on extra cases at work, spending late nights in the office to keep up with the mounting bills, while Sarah threw herself into teaching, staying late at St. Mary’s to grade papers or plan lessons.
They barely saw each other, their shared grief creating a distance neither of them knew how to bridge. The third attempt ended in heartbreak, too: a miscarriage at six weeks.
Sarah sat on the bathroom floor that night, her knees drawn to her chest as she stared blankly at the tiles. Michael found her there, kneeling beside her and pulling her into his arms as she cried silently against his chest.
“I can’t do this anymore,” she whispered.
Michael pressed a kiss to her hair, his own tears falling silently. “We’ll stop if that’s what you want. But whatever happens, I’m not going anywhere.”
Days later, Michael was the one who brought up the idea of trying one final time.
“I know it’s asking a lot,” he said, sitting across from Sarah at their kitchen table. His dark eyes searched hers, filled with both fear and hope. “But I don’t want to give up yet. One more try, Sarah. If it doesn’t work, we’ll figure out what’s next. Together.”
Sarah hesitated, her fingers tracing the edge of her coffee mug. The exhaustion of their journey weighed heavily on her, her heart bruised from the weight of their losses. Despite it all, the way Michael looked at her, with such unwavering love, made her believe they still had a chance.
“Okay,” she said finally, her voice quiet but resolute. “One more try.”
On the morning of their fourth attempt, Michael’s grandmother arrived at their house with two small red bracelets in her hands.
“These are for luck,” she said, carefully slipping the bracelets onto their wrists. “And for strength.”
They wore them every day, a symbol of the hope and determination that bound them together.
The waiting room at the Boston Reproductive Center was a familiar place by now, but familiarity didn’t make it any easier. Michael and Sarah sat side by side, their hands clasped tightly together, the red bracelets on their wrists glinting faintly under the fluorescent lights. The room was quiet except for the soft murmur of the receptionist’s voice at the front desk and the occasional hum of the air conditioning.
Michael’s thumb moved in slow, absent patterns across the back of Sarah’s hand. It was a small gesture, something he hoped would reassure her, though the truth was that he was as nervous as she was. His other hand rested on his knee, gripping it tightly enough that his knuckles had turned white. The minutes ticked by, each stretching the silence between them.
Sarah shifted in her seat, her green eyes fixed on the floor as if the answers they sought might be found in the speckled tiles. She had barely spoken on the way to the clinic, and Michael hadn’t pushed her to talk. He understood the weight she carried because it was the same weight he carried himself—the weight of three failures, three losses, and three heartbreaks that had nearly broken them both.
“It’s going to be okay,” Michael said softly, though he wasn’t entirely sure if he was trying to reassure her or himself.
Sarah nodded, but her lips pressed into a thin, tense line. “What if it’s not?” she whispered, her voice trembling with the question she had been holding back for weeks.
Michael’s heart ached at the fear in her voice. He turned toward her, his gaze steady despite the knot in his chest. “Then we’ll figure it out. We always do.”
Before Sarah could reply, the door to the waiting room opened. A nurse in scrubs stepped out, clipboard in hand, her eyes scanning the room. “Michael and Sarah Chen?” she called, her tone polite but efficient.
Michael rose first, extending his hand to Sarah to help her up. Her fingers trembled slightly in his grasp. Together, they followed the nurse down the hallway, their footsteps barely making a sound on the linoleum floor.
The hallway was lined with photographs of smiling families, each one a testament to the clinic’s purpose. Couples cradled newborns, toddlers grinned with toothy smiles, and twins wrapped in identical blankets slept peacefully in their parents’ arms. Sarah’s eyes lingered on one photo in particular: a woman holding twins, her expression radiant with joy. Michael noticed the way Sarah’s shoulders tightened, so he gave her a gentle squeeze. It was all he could do.
Dr. Rachel Goldman’s office was just as clinical as the rest of the facility, though small touches of warmth made it feel less intimidating. A leafy green plant thrived on the windowsill, and a framed photo of Dr. Goldman with her golden retriever sat on the corner of her desk. On the wall hung a colorful poster of a blooming lotus, the words ""Hope Grows Here"" printed beneath it in a neat, flowing script.
Michael and Sarah sat down in the two chairs in front of the desk, their hands still entwined. Neither of them spoke. The silence in the room felt heavy, filled with anticipation that neither of them dared to voice.
Dr. Goldman entered moments later, a folder in her hands and a professional calm on her face. She greeted them politely, her tone measured, but her expression gave nothing away. “Good morning,” she said, sitting down across from them.
Michael’s heart pounded so loudly that he was sure Sarah could hear it. He started biting his nails as his stomach twisted in knots. He glanced at Sarah, taking in the tension in her face, the way her jaw was clenched as though bracing for impact. He wanted to say something to comfort her, but the words felt caught in his throat.
Dr. Goldman placed the folder on the desk and opened it carefully, glancing at the papers inside. “Let’s get right to it,” she said, her eyes flicking between the two of them. Her gaze softened, the slightest curve of a smile forming on her lips.
Michael held his breath.
“Congratulations,” Dr. Goldman said gently, the smile growing as she met their eyes. “You’re pregnant.”
For a moment, the words didn’t make sense. They hung in the air, suspended in the space between what Michael had feared and what he had hoped for. The room felt impossibly still, the tension giving way to something neither of them had dared to believe.
Sarah’s hand flew to her mouth as a choked sob escaped her lips. Tears spilled freely down her cheeks, her shoulders shaking with emotion. “Oh my God,” she whispered, her voice breaking. “Oh my God.”
Michael stared at Dr. Goldman, his mind struggling to catch up with the moment. Pregnant. They were pregnant. After months of heartbreak, three failed attempts, nights of tears, and mornings when hope felt impossible, they had finally made it.
He turned to Sarah, his vision blurred by tears he didn’t try to hide. He pulled her into his arms, holding her tightly as her sobs grew louder. His forehead pressed against hers, and his hands cupped her face as he whispered, “We did it. We did it.”
Sarah clung to him, her hands gripping his shoulders like she was afraid the moment might vanish if she let go. “I can’t believe it,” she said through her tears. Her voice trembled, still carrying the fear she had held onto for so long. “I was so scared, Michael. I was so scared it wouldn’t—”
“Me too,” Michael admitted, his voice breaking as he spoke. “But we’re here. We’re finally here.”
Dr. Goldman gave them a moment to collect themselves, her own smile calm and steady. She glanced at her notes before speaking again, her tone even as she began to outline the next steps in their pregnancy. Michael tried to focus on what she was saying, but her earlier words still echoed in his mind. You’re pregnant. He held onto those words like they were a lifeline, his hands never leaving Sarah’s as Dr. Goldman explained their care plan.
When they left the office, the sunlight outside felt brighter than it had in months. Michael and Sarah stepped onto the sidewalk, their fingers still laced together, the red bracelets on their wrists gleaming in the afternoon light. The air felt warmer and fresher, and every sound seemed sharper. For the first time in what felt like forever, the world felt full of possibility.
Sarah stopped, turning to him with tears still glistening in her eyes. “Michael,” she said softly, her voice filled with wonder. “We’re going to be parents.”
Michael smiled, his heart so full it felt as though it might burst. “Yes,” he said, brushing a tear from her cheek. “We’re going to be parents.”
For the first time in years, hope didn’t feel like a fragile thing. It felt real.
Chapter 2: The Storm That Saved Us
The rain had started two nights ago, tapping gently against the windows of the Williams' two-story Victorian home at 1423 Dauphine Street. At first, it had been nothing more than a soft, steady rhythm, a background score to the humid late-August air. Now, as the first pale rays of dawn struggled to pierce through the slate-gray clouds, the rain had turned into a relentless force, battering the house with a fury that made the walls seem to shudder.
The house itself stood defiant against the tempest, which was a testament to its old-world charm and sturdy construction. Built decades earlier, its blue-gray clapboard siding bore the marks of many seasons, with the paint faded in patches and the white-trimmed windows showing streaks of grime where rain dripped endlessly. The porch, with its sagging steps and chipped railings, was now half-submerged in the rising water. The tall, narrow windows of the second floor overlooked the street like watchful eyes, though the scene outside offered little hope—just swirling floodwaters, debris, and the occasional glimpse of a branch torn free by the wind. Above it all, the weather vane, shaped like a rooster, turned helplessly in the gusts.
Inside, the flickering light of the television filled the living room, casting long shadows on the floral wallpaper and bouncing off the ornate mirror above the mantel. The house, normally bustling with warmth and chatter, now felt claustrophobic, the walls pressing in with each howl of the wind. The air was thick with tension, almost as if the storm outside had crept in and settled among them.
James sat on the edge of the leather couch, his elbows resting on his knees, his large hands clasped together as he stared at the small, battery-powered television. The screen showed an ominous swirl of red, orange, and yellow—Katrina’s wrath laid bare in pixelated radar imagery. The meteorologist’s voice carried through the room, calm yet dire, as he delivered updates that seemed more like warnings. “Hurricane Katrina has now reached Category 5, with sustained winds of 175 miles per hour. A storm surge of 20 feet or higher is expected in some areas. Flooding is imminent. If you haven’t evacuated, seek higher ground immediately.”
James didn’t move, his dark brown eyes fixed on the screen. At 45, he was a man who had always exuded quiet authority, a trait honed over decades of teaching high school history. His tall, broad-shouldered, usually commanding frame now seemed weighed down by the gravity of the moment. The lines on his face, etched by years of steady resolve, seemed deeper in the flickering light. His salt-and-pepper hair, neatly cropped, was damp from sweat, and his glasses sat slightly askew on his nose, though he made no move to adjust them. He wore a light blue button-down shirt with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows and dark gray slacks, the hems stained with water from his earlier trip to check the rising flood outside. His polished leather loafers had been replaced by a pair of old sneakers, their soles worn but sturdy.
“You think we’ll be safe here?” he muttered, though his question was rhetorical. He glanced toward the window, where the sound of the rain was punctuated by the occasional creak of the house.
His wife, Patricia, stood by the doorway to the kitchen, clutching the remote control like a lifeline. Her almond-brown skin, normally glowing with warmth, looked pale under the dim light. At 42, she had the sharp, no-nonsense demeanor of a woman who had spent her life balancing responsibilities—as a postal worker, wife, and mother. Her tightly braided hair was pinned into a bun, though a few strands had escaped and curled against the nape of her neck. She was dressed in her postal uniform: a navy blue polo shirt and matching pants, though she had kicked off her work boots hours ago. Her feet, clad in mismatched socks, shifted restlessly on the wooden floor.
Her lips pressed into a thin line as she stared at James, her jaw tightening with each passing second. “We should’ve left when we had the chance,” she said, her voice low but sharp. Her dark eyes flicked to the television screen, then back to her husband. “But no, you said we could ride it out. Said this house would hold.”
James sighed heavily and ran a hand over his face. “You think I don’t know that? Where would we have gone? The highways were already jammed. We would’ve been stuck in that car with Mama and the kids, with no food, no gas—no guarantee we’d even make it out alive.”
Patricia shook her head, crossing her arms tightly over her chest. Her gold hoop earrings caught the faint light as she shifted her weight, her frustration palpable. “And staying here is better?” she shot back, her voice rising slightly. “What happens when the water gets in? You got a plan for that, James?”
James didn’t respond. He turned his gaze back to the television, though he wasn’t really watching. His jaw clenched as he processed her words, the unspoken fear in them mirroring his own.
Across the room, his twelve-year-old son, Marcus, knelt beside Grandmother Rose’s recliner, adjusting the clear plastic tubing of her oxygen tank. Marcus was tall and gangly, his limbs slightly too long for his thin frame. His dark brown skin had a faint sheen of sweat, and his black hair was cropped short, though a stubborn cowlick near his temple refused to lie flat. He wore a faded Chicago Bulls T-shirt—his favorite, despite the small hole near the hem—and a pair of black basketball shorts that hung slightly loose on his narrow hips. His bare feet pressed into the thin, threadbare carpet as he worked, his movements careful and deliberate.
“You okay, Grandma?” he asked, his voice steady but tinged with concern. His dark eyes, so much like his father’s, searched her face for any sign of discomfort.
Rose, at seventy-eight, was a tiny woman, her frail frame nearly swallowed by the oversized recliner. Her housecoat, a faded floral print that had seen countless storms, hung loosely on her bony shoulders. Her gray hair was pulled back into a loose bun with several wispy strands falling out to frame her weathered face. Her deep brown eyes, sharp despite the weariness in her features, focused on Marcus with a quiet sense of affection.
“I’m fine, baby,” she rasped, her voice thin but firm. She raised a hand, her gnarled fingers trembling slightly as she patted his arm. “Don’t you worry about me. Just keep this ol’ machine running, and I’ll be just fine.”
Nearby, Keisha sat cross-legged on the floor, shuffling a deck of Uno cards. At nine years old, she was small for her age, with round cheeks and bright brown eyes that seemed too wide for her face. Her long black hair was braided into two neat plaits, tied with pink ribbons that matched her lavender pajama set, decorated with tiny white stars. The chatterbox of the family, Keisha, had been unusually quiet all evening, her little hands moving the cards back and forth more for comfort than for play.
“Grandma,” she asked suddenly, her voice small but insistent, “you’re not scared?”
Rose chuckled softly, though the sound quickly dissolved into a wheezing cough. Marcus straightened, ready to grab the glass of water on the side table, but Rose waved him off, her thin hand shaking slightly. When the coughing subsided, she looked at Keisha with a faint smile. “Baby, I’ve lived through storms you can’t even imagine. This one’s bad, but worrying about it won’t do us any good.”
Keisha frowned, her brow furrowed as she reshuffled the cards. “But what if the water—”
“Keisha,” Marcus interrupted, his tone gentle but firm. “Grandma just said not to worry. So don’t.”
Keisha nodded reluctantly, though her fidgeting with the cards didn’t stop.
James stood abruptly and crossed to the window, parting the heavy floral curtains to peer outside. The street, once lined with parked cars and oak trees, was now a river. The water had reached the top of the porch steps, swirling in angry eddies as it carried debris down the street—branches, garbage cans, even an abandoned tricycle. The sight made his chest tighten, his fists clenching at his sides.
“Marcus,” he called over his shoulder, his voice steady but firm. “Grab some towels. Block the doors. Keisha, help him.”
Marcus jumped to his feet, nodding. “On it,” he said, motioning for Keisha to follow him. The two disappeared into the hallway, their footsteps quick but purposeful.
Patricia joined James at the window, her breath catching as she saw the water. For the first time that night, the fear she had been holding back broke through. “James,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “It’s already at the porch. If it comes inside—”
James reached for her hand, his grip steady despite the storm brewing inside him. “We’ll get through this,” he said, his voice low but resolute. “We just need to stay calm. For the kids.”
Patricia didn’t reply, but she didn’t pull her hand away either. Together, they watched as the rain continued to fall, each drop a reminder of just how little time they had left.
James stared out at the floodwaters clawing at the top of the porch steps, the swirling debris a cruel reminder of how quickly the world outside had become unrecognizable. He tightened his grip on the floral curtain, his knuckles whitening. For all his calm, his steady reassurances to Patricia and the kids, the truth sat heavily in his chest—there was no telling how long the house could hold. He swallowed hard, feeling the weight of the silence beside him.
Patricia stood close, her flashlight casting long shadows against the peeling wallpaper. She exhaled slowly, her breath shallow, as if steadying herself. Her eyes, dark and sharp, flicked to James. “Do you think anyone else stayed behind?” she asked, breaking the uneasy quiet.
James didn’t answer right away. He turned back to the window, his gaze following the water as it lapped at the porch railing and rushed into the street. It moved with a dark purpose, carrying with it pieces of their neighborhood—a tire, a half-crushed mailbox, a child’s pink sneaker bobbing and disappearing into the current. Somewhere out there, he thought, someone had to be fighting the same battle they were.
His thoughts drifted to the Nguyens, two blocks away. Minh’s family had run Saigon Kitchen for as long as James could remember. Minh was as proud of that restaurant as James was of the house he’d poured his own sweat and time into, a place built for family and filled with memories. James had seen Minh yesterday, standing outside the restaurant in the downpour, securing the shutters. Even then, there was determination in his eyes, the same quiet stubbornness James recognized in himself. Minh wouldn’t leave, not without a fight.
“They’re still there,” James said finally, his voice quiet. “The Nguyens. I saw Minh yesterday—he wasn’t going anywhere.”
Patricia frowned, her lips pressing into a thin line. “If the water gets as bad as they’re saying, no restaurant’s going to save them.”
The rain hammered against the windows, drowning out whatever James might have said next. His gaze lingered outside, past the churning water and toward the vague direction of Dauphine Street.
James turned away from the window and let the curtain fall back into place. He ran a hand over his face, the tension in his shoulders coiling tighter with every passing second. Somewhere out there, the Nguyens were facing the same storm—and the same fears. For their sake, he hoped they had made the right choice.
***
Two blocks away, another light glowed faintly, cutting through the storm in its own way.
The neon sign outside Saigon Kitchen sputtered weakly against the rain, its once-bold red glow reduced to a faint flicker. Water pooled at the restaurant’s foundation, rippling and swirling with each gust of wind. From the street, the building looked small, a pale yellow beacon huddled between the shadows of taller structures. Its shutters bolted and painted a flat gray, held firm against the storm, though rain leaked through unseen cracks, leaving streaks on the worn wood.
Inside, the restaurant was eerily quiet, the usual hum of clinking chopsticks, chatter, and sizzling woks replaced by the faint hiss of wind sneaking through the edges of the windows. The hardwood floor, polished to a dull shine, creaked faintly as Minh Nguyen paced the length of the room, his arms crossed tightly over his broad chest.
Minh’s face, deeply lined from years of hard work and long hours, was set in a grim expression. His dark brown eyes, sharp and heavy with worry, darted between the front door and the high water already visible through the cracks in the shutters. He was 49, though he carried himself with the weight of someone older, his jet-black hair streaked with gray at the temples. He wore a plain white T-shirt that clung to his chest from the humidity and a pair of khaki pants belted tightly around his waist. His feet were bare, his soles planted firmly on the wood as though bracing himself against the storm.
His hands, calloused and strong from decades of chopping, hauling, and grilling, trembled slightly as he checked the bolts on the door for what felt like the hundredth time. He muttered under his breath, a string of Vietnamese words too quiet for anyone to hear, his voice low and rough. His pacing grew more urgent, the air around him heavy with his agitation.
“Minh,” a voice called from behind him, firm but steady.
Minh stopped mid-step and turned toward the kitchen. Mai stood in the doorway, her hands on her hips, her head tilted slightly to the side as she studied her husband. Her dark eyes, almond-shaped and sharp with determination, didn’t waver as they locked onto his. For a woman of 47, Mai carried herself with a quiet, grounded strength, her presence calm and commanding even in the face of the storm.
She wore a deep red blouse with the sleeves rolled up to her elbows, revealing slender, muscular arms earned through years of cooking and chopping. Her black trousers, loose but practical, were speckled with faint traces of flour and oil from the kitchen. Stray strands of dark hair cascaded down her cheeks, having slipped from the tightly secured bun at the back of her neck. Though her frame was petite, her movements were deliberate and sure, her confidence honed by years of managing both the restaurant and the chaos of daily life.
“You need to stop pacing,” she said in a measured but unyielding voice. She nodded toward the door he had just checked. “The bolts aren’t going anywhere.”
Minh frowned, his lips pressing into a thin line. “The water’s rising,” he said, his voice gruff. He gestured vaguely toward the shuttered windows. “I can feel it.”
Mai stepped closer, her bare feet silent against the creaking floor. Her hand found his arm, her touch firm but reassuring. “We already know the water’s rising,” she said quietly. “The question is, what are we going to do about it?”
Minh’s shoulders sagged slightly, though his jaw remained tight. He glanced toward the front counter, where a small, framed photograph hung crookedly on the wall. The photo, taken decades earlier, showed a younger version of himself standing behind the counter with Mai. In the background, the restaurant’s freshly painted sign proudly proclaimed: Saigon Kitchen – Est. 1975. It was the year his family had fled Vietnam with nothing but the clothes on their backs, the restaurant becoming their lifeline in a foreign country. Every inch of this place carried their story—letting it go felt like an impossible task.
But Mai’s hand on his arm steadied him. “We’ll rebuild,” she said softly, her voice resolute. “We’ve done it before.”
Before Minh could respond, a faint creak of footsteps drew their attention. In the corner of the room, a small figure shifted on a wooden stool.
Bà Nội, Minh’s mother, sat hunched slightly forward, her delicate frame almost swallowed by the loose white blouse she wore. Her black trousers, simple and frayed at the hem, clung to her thin legs, which were neatly crossed at the ankles. Her silver hair, tied into a low bun at the base of her neck, glinted faintly under the harsh fluorescent lights. Though she was 75, there was an unyielding sharpness in her almond-shaped eyes as they flicked between her son and daughter-in-law.
She reached up with a thin, trembling hand, adjusting the silk scarf draped loosely over her shoulders. Dyed a vibrant shade of green, the scarf seemed out of place against the gray storm that loomed around them. “You’re wasting time,” she said finally. Her words, spoken in Vietnamese, cut through the air with quiet authority.
Minh turned to her, his expression softening. “Mẹ, it’s not that simple—”
“It is,” she interrupted, her tone firm. She gestured toward the shuttered windows with a frail but deliberate hand. “This place is just a building. It is not our family. You’ve forgotten what’s important.”
Minh hesitated, his jaw tightening as he processed her words. He looked back at the photo on the wall, then at the laminated menus still neatly stacked by the register. His eyes lingered on the shelves of hoisin sauce and jars of chili paste, all arranged with the precision of someone who took pride in every detail.
In the doorway to the back room, David stood silently, watching the exchange. At fourteen, he was already taller than his mother, his long limbs slightly awkward as though he hadn’t quite grown into them. His dark eyes, so much like Minh’s, were steady but filled with the kind of quiet intensity that came with being both observant and impatient.
He wore a faded gray hoodie with the sleeves pushed up to his elbows, the fabric damp and clinging to his arms from earlier trips outside. His navy school pants were rumpled and stained at the knees, a reminder of his efforts to help secure the shutters. He clutched a small duffel bag in one hand, his knuckles white around the strap.
“Dad,” he said quietly, his voice cutting through the room. He didn’t wait for a response before continuing. “The water’s already in the street. It’s only a matter of time before it gets inside. We need to go.”
Minh turned to his son, his countenance relaxing as he crouched slightly to meet David’s gaze. “You don’t understand,” Minh began, his voice low but insistent. “This place—it’s everything to us. It kept us alive when we had nothing.”
David didn’t look away, his jaw tightening. “And it’s going to kill us if we stay,” he replied, his voice calm but unwavering.
“David,” Mai said sharply, stepping forward. Her voice carried the weight of authority, and the boy fell silent, though his fists clenched at his sides.
Bà Nội shifted again on her stool, leaning forward slightly. Her frail frame belied the strength in her presence, her words cutting through the tension in the room. “Your son is right,” she said quietly, her gaze fixed on Minh. “We survived once before because we chose to let go. You have to choose again.”
The room fell silent except for the faint hum of the fluorescent lights and the muffled roar of the storm outside. Minh exhaled slowly, his shoulders sagging as the weight of her words settled over him.
Finally, he nodded. “Grab what you can carry,” he said, his voice heavy with emotion.
David didn’t wait for further instruction. He slung the duffel bag over his shoulder and disappeared into the kitchen, gathering bottles of water and cans of food. Mai followed, her movements brisk and efficient, while Minh turned back to his mother, offering her his hand.
Bà Nội waved him off, standing slowly but steadily on her own. “I may be old,” she said, a faint smile tugging at her lips, “but I’m not weak.”
Together, the Nguyen family left Saigon Kitchen behind, stepping into the swirling rain as the waters continued to rise.
Minh hesitated at the door, his hand resting on the wooden frame as he looked back into the dim interior of Saigon Kitchen—the laminated menus on the counter, the stacks of jars lining the shelves, the empty chairs and tables that had once been filled with laughter, the sound of chopsticks tapping against bowls, and the warmth of the life they had built here.
“Minh,” Mai called softly, her voice pulling him back. She stood behind him, holding two plastic bags filled with water bottles and canned goods. Her wet hair clung to her face, her red blouse darkening with rain where it stuck to her skin. In her other hand, she clutched a small framed photograph—the same one Minh had been staring at moments ago, the one of his younger self and his wife, taken when they had first opened the restaurant.
“We have to go,” she said gently, but there was no room for argument in her tone.
Minh swallowed hard and stepped into the rain, letting the door fall shut behind him. The neon sign sputtered once more, its glow fading into the storm.
The street was a river. Dark water, cold and relentless, rushed around their legs as the Nguyen family trudged forward in silence. Minh led the way, holding a plastic bag in one hand and gripping Bà Nội’s elbow with the other. She hadn’t asked for help—she never would, but the water was already on her knees, and Minh wasn’t willing to take any chances.
David walked just behind them, his duffel bag slung over one shoulder, the weight making him lean slightly to one side. He had insisted on carrying the heaviest load, plunging ahead with a quiet determination in his steps. His hoodie clung to his back, soaked through and heavy, but he didn’t complain.
Mai followed closely, her eyes scanning the flooded street, alert for hidden debris or sudden dips in the road. A mangled lawn chair floated past, bumping against her leg before spinning away in the current. She gritted her teeth and focused on the faint glow of the Williams’ house up ahead. The yellow porch light was barely visible through the sheets of rain, but it was enough.
“Almost there,” Minh said over his shoulder, though the wind nearly swallowed his words.
David glanced back at his grandmother, his brow furrowed. “You okay, Bà Nội?”
The old woman straightened, shaking off Minh’s hand and planting her feet firmly in the water. “I’m fine,” she said, her voice sharp despite the storm. “Keep walking. Don’t waste your energy worrying about me.”
A faint smile tugged at David’s lips, but he turned back around without another word.
When they reached the Williams’ house, the water had risen to the top step of the porch. Minh knocked loudly, his fist hitting the wood in three sharp, deliberate raps. The door opened a moment later, and James stood there, his tall frame filling the doorway. His dark eyes widened slightly as he took in the sight of the Nguyen family, drenched and shivering but standing strong.
“James,” Minh said, his voice steady but heavy with exhaustion. “The restaurant—it’s gone. We couldn’t stay. I didn’t know where else to go.”
James didn’t hesitate. He stepped back, gesturing them inside. “Get in here,” he said, his voice firm but warm. “All of you.”
Inside, the warmth of the Williams’ home was a stark contrast to the chaos outside. The faint hum of Grandmother Rose’s oxygen tank filled the living room, blending with the muffled roar of the storm against the windows. Marcus and Keisha stood by the staircase, their wide eyes flicking between the soaked Nguyen family and their parents. Patricia appeared from the kitchen, a stack of towels in her arms, her brows furrowed with concern.
“Here,” she said, handing the towels out one by one. “You’re all soaked. Let’s get you dried off.”
Mai took one gratefully, quickly wrapping it around Bà Nội’s thin shoulders before drying her own face. David dropped his duffel bag near the door and grabbed a towel, rubbing it over his dripping hair.
“You didn’t have to knock,” Patricia said, her voice softening as she looked at Minh. “You know you’re always welcome here.”
Minh gave her a small nod, his lips twitching into the faintest of smiles. “Thank you,” he said quietly.
Grandmother Rose, sitting in her recliner near the stairs, tilted her head slightly as her gaze landed on Bà Nội. “You’re Minh’s mama?” she asked, her raspy voice cutting through the room.
Bà Nội straightened her back, her sharp eyes meeting Rose’s. “And you’re the grandmother,” she replied, her tone brisk. She gestured toward the oxygen tank with a frail but steady hand. “That keeps you alive?”
Rose chuckled dryly, tapping the side of the tank. “Keeps me breathing, at least.” She studied Bà Nội for a moment, then added, “We’ll share if you need it. Not much else to do when the world’s going underwater.”
For a moment, the two women simply looked at each other, their expressions unreadable. Then, to everyone’s surprise, Bà Nội smiled—a small, fleeting thing, but unmistakable. “Thank you,” she said simply.
The hours crawled by, measured by the steady drum of rain and the occasional creak of the house settling under the storm’s weight. By 6:45 AM, the barometer had dropped to 920 millibars. The wind screamed against the windows, the glass trembling as though on the verge of shattering. Outside, the water had risen from two feet to twelve, swallowing cars and yards, leaving only the tops of street signs visible in its wake.
Upstairs, the two families gathered in the Williams’ second-floor guest room. Supplies from both households had been piled neatly in the corner—bags of rice, cans of beans, and plastic water bottles. Marcus and David knelt beside the pile, their heads bent close together as they worked.
David ran his hand over the notebook Marcus had opened, where the younger boy had scrawled a rough inventory. “So, we’ve got six bottles of water, three bags of rice, and five cans of beans,” David said, his voice low.
Marcus nodded, chewing on the end of his pencil. “If we’re careful, that could last a few days,” he said. “But no seconds. And no wasting.”
“Agreed,” David replied, his tone serious. He picked up a can of beans and turned it over in his hands. “You ever cooked with just this?”
Marcus smirked faintly. “No, but I figure it’s not that different from heating up a can of soup, right?”
David chuckled under his breath, the sound brief but genuine. “You’re not wrong.”
Nearby, Mai and Patricia worked to set up makeshift sleeping spaces with blankets and pillows. Minh and James stood by the window, their postures tense as they watched the water rise below.
“You think it’ll hold?” Minh asked quietly, his eyes on the base of the house as it disappeared beneath the floodwaters.
James didn’t answer right away. He exhaled slowly, his broad shoulders rising and falling. “It has to,” he said finally.
The faint sound of laughter drew their attention. Rose and Bà Nội sat side by side on the edge of the bed, the oxygen tank between them. Rose had just said something, her raspy chuckle blending with the softer, melodic sound of Bà Nội’s laugh. It was a fragile, fleeting moment of light in the darkness of the storm.
Minh glanced at James and gave him a small nod. “Thank you,” he said.
James returned the nod. “We’re in this together now.”
The night crawled by in fractured moments of fear and restless waiting. Sleep came in short, uneasy bursts for those who tried, though the constant groaning of the house and the relentless pounding of the rain kept most of them awake.
By dawn, the floodwaters had reached the windows on the first floor, their dark, oily surface lapping hungrily at the glass. James and Minh had ventured downstairs only once, wading through knee-deep water to salvage a few items left behind—a roll of duct tape, a soaked box of crackers, and a photo album that James refused to leave behind. The ground floor was no longer recognizable, the water swallowing the furniture and walls in an eerie, muffled silence.
When James returned to the second floor, his face was pale but resolute. “It’s coming up faster now,” he said, running a hand through his damp hair. “If it gets higher, we’re gonna need to move again.”
Minh nodded grimly, his eyes flicking toward the attic hatch in the ceiling. “You think the roof can hold all of us?”
“It’s not about the roof holding,” James replied, his voice low. “It’s about us holding on.”
After an hour, the water was nearly at the second-floor windows. That’s when they heard it—a faint, rhythmic hum cutting through the chaos of the storm. James froze mid-step, his hand tightening around the windowsill as he strained to listen. The others looked up, their movements sharp with hope and confusion.
“Is that…?” Patricia began, her voice barely a whisper.
“A helicopter,” David confirmed, already moving toward the window. He pressed his face to the glass, squinting against the sheets of rain. “It’s a helicopter!”
James didn’t wait. He turned to Minh, his voice steady but urgent. “We need to get to the roof. Now.”
“Marcus, grab the supplies!” Patricia called as she stood, pulling Keisha to her feet. Mai moved quickly to help Bà Nội, who waved off the assistance but allowed herself to be guided toward the attic hatch.
James reached for the metal pull cord hanging from the ceiling and yanked hard. The hatch creaked open, the small ladder unfolding with a groan. “One at a time,” he said, motioning for Patricia to go first. “Be careful.”
Patricia climbed up, Keisha following close behind. Marcus and David handed up the supplies, their movements hurried but careful. When everyone else had made it through, Minh turned to James, his expression grim.
“You sure it’s safe up there?” Minh asked.
James met his gaze evenly. “It’s safer than staying here.”
The rooftop was a battlefield. The wind howled like a living thing, whipping rain into stinging needles that lashed against skin and clothes. The shingles were slick, forcing each step to be cautious and deliberate. Around them, the floodwaters surged hungrily, swallowing everything in sight. The top of a streetlamp poked out of the murky water a few houses down, its light long extinguished.
James crouched near the chimney, his arm wrapped tightly around Rose to keep her steady. The elderly woman clung to her oxygen tank with trembling hands, her face pale as she fought for each breath. Minh and Mai huddled nearby with David and Bà Nội, their soaked clothes plastered to their skin as they shielded the old woman from the relentless rain. Patricia held Keisha close, murmuring reassurances that were barely audible over the storm’s relentless roar. Marcus stood by his father’s side, his small hands gripping the duffel bag they had hauled up from the attic.
The rhythmic hum they had heard earlier was growing louder. James’s head snapped up, his eyes narrowing against the rain as he scanned the horizon. There, emerging from the swirling gray clouds, was the bright orange silhouette of the Coast Guard HH-65 Dolphin helicopter.
“They’re here!” James shouted, his voice hoarse but filled with relief.
The helicopter hovered above them, its blades slicing through the air with a deafening roar. The downdraft was immediate and brutal, flattening what little remained of the nearby trees and sending loose shingles skittering across the rooftop.
Lieutenant Sarah Martinez leaned out of the side door, her gloved hands gripping the edge as she assessed the scene below. She was clad in a bright orange flight suit, her helmet’s visor pulled down to shield her eyes from the rain. Her voice crackled through the loudspeaker, sharp and commanding.
“This is the Coast Guard! We’ll get you out, but you have to stay calm!”
The winch whirred to life, lowering a rescue basket attached to a steel cable. The basket swayed wildly in the wind, the storm fighting every inch of the helicopter’s effort to hold position. Martinez gestured firmly, her voice cutting through the roar of the blades. “One at a time! Stay low and hold on tight!”
James moved first, helping Patricia guide Keisha toward the basket. The young girl clung to her mother, her wide eyes fixed on the swaying cable as it descended.
“It’s okay, baby,” Patricia said, her voice steady despite the trembling in her hands. “I’ll be right behind you. Just hold on tight, okay?”
Keisha nodded, her lips pressed into a thin, trembling line. James gripped the basket with both hands, steadying it against the wind as Patricia helped Keisha climb inside. The cable jolted as the basket lifted off the roof, swinging precariously as the helicopter adjusted to the gusts. Keisha’s small figure clung tightly to the basket’s sides, her face buried in her arms as she was pulled skyward.
“Hold steady!” Martinez barked into her headset, her eyes fixed on the child as the winch pulled her safely into the cabin.
When the basket came back down, Marcus was next. The boy hesitated, looking back at James. “What about you, Dad?”
“I’ll be right there,” James assured him, gripping his son’s shoulder firmly. “Now go. Your sister’s waiting for you.”
Marcus climbed in, his knuckles white as he gripped the sides of the basket. The wind caught it again, jerking it to the side as the winch began to lift. For a heart-stopping moment, the cable swung dangerously close to the edge of the roof, and James surged forward, his hands instinctively reaching out.
“Hold him steady!” James yelled.
Martinez leaned out further, her body straining against the harness tethered to her suit. “Bring it up slow!” she ordered into her mic.
The basket steadied, rising higher until Marcus was safely pulled into the cabin. Martinez gave a curt nod, her gloved hand signaling for the cable to lower again.
“Next!”
Mai turned to David, her hand gripping his arm. “Go,” she urged, her voice firm.
David didn’t argue. He climbed into the basket with the ease of someone used to navigating unsteady footing, his eyes fixed upward as the winch began to lift him. The basket swung wildly again, and the storm determined to wrest control, but David’s hands held firm. Martinez leaned out as far as her harness would allow, her hand extended to guide him in.
“Got you, kid!” she called as David grabbed hold of her arm, his face grim but steady.
Back on the roof, Mai and Minh helped Bà Nội toward the basket. The old woman’s frail frame looked impossibly small as the wind whipped at her scarf, pulling it loose and sending it spiraling into the water below. Minh crouched beside her, his hands firm on her shoulders.
“Mẹ, hold on tight,” he said, his voice breaking slightly.
Bà Nội glanced at him, her sharp eyes softening. “Stop fussing,” she said, her tone dry but affectionate. “I’ve done harder things than this.”
Minh and Mai lifted her into the basket, their hands lingering for just a moment before stepping back. As the winch began to lift her, Minh’s shoulders sagged with relief, his hand reaching for Mai’s.
When the basket returned, it was Mai’s turn.

The Honey Hole: An Alaskan Novel
3 ratings","This book, The Honey Hole by Robert Brian, is a story of a former oil worker named Roy who once enjoyed financial stability but got laid off, leading him into depression, and still endured a quiet and peaceful breakup with Liz. Despite having little hope, he pressed on in search of survival and, along the way, met an old gold miner and his daughter, Sam, who was the complete opposite of his lost love. They experienced different adventures together and slowly became one. This is my definition of a perfect romance setting, and I enjoyed the time I spent on this book while it lasted. While reading this book, I noticed the author tried to bring every character together as one big family with minimal enmity despite having varying backgrounds. As much as this is a story, it teaches many lessons about traditions and family while factoring in feelings of trust, respect, and love. The general acceptance by both the living and the nonliving was something that awed me. The author also toned down any gross sexual elements with mild references to the physical contacts made, while focusing instead on the emotional journey and gradual development of love, which makes this book suitable for all readers, especially adventurous book lovers. Another point worthy of note is the editing of the book. I could barely find any errors while reading, and that got me more interested in the book.  I will rate this book a four out of five because the author did a good job with the storyline. However, my issue with the book was the lack of clear transitions between the character perspectives. I get confused when I read and suddenly see a different character name, and I will be forced to go back to reread and take note of where the storyline diverted. A line break or use of special characters will help reduce this confusion. Other than this, I enjoyed every single part of this book. Thank you, Robert, for this masterpiece. I am looking forward to reading more of your books."

Each hand touches the trunk; the message is identical for all.
“IT IS TIME NAMUH, YOU ARE NOW THIS WORLDS ONLY HOPE.”
On their approach to the tree, the five individuals had remained unaware of one another. But upon realisingtheyarenotalone,theymovearoundthemassivetrunktoseewhoelsehasarrived.
Everyone in the group looks at Apollo, who appears to be having a conversation with the air next to the Kauritree.
Apollo has the physique of a career bodybuilder and stands at an impressive 191 centimetres tall. As he speaksintothecool,moisture-filledair,hisyouthful,lightbrownfaceispointedalmoststraightup.
Each person edges closer, except for Sophia, who is now leaning against the tree. Unlike the others, she can hearbothpartiesintheconversation,notjustApollo.
“But I don’t know these people!” Apollo cries in a deep voice, his strong New Zealand accent informing the rest of thegroupthatheisalocal.
Apollo converses with a Sprite, a forest spirit who oversees the energies within a section of the forest.
A Sprite is the energy being, the soul of a garden, a group of trees, a forest, tidal current in an ocean, or a sectionofariver.Normally,thebiggertheSprite,themoreareaitlooksafter,andthisoneismonstrouslyhuge.

Apollo looks at Sophia, shocked that she can hear the conversation. He has never met anyone who can confirmthatwhatheisseeingisnotjusthisimagination.Anotherpersonhasnowvalidatedtheseentitieshesees.
He soon recovers, turns to the others in the forest, and mutters, “Well, you might think I’m crazy, but there isaverylargeentityinfrontofus,wantingustoworktogether,todirecthumanityinadifferentdirectionsomehow,anditkeepsreferringtousastheNamuh.”
Brahma, Bollywood movie-star handsome, excitedly replies in a Southern Indian accent, “I do not think thatyouarefuckingcrazyatall.Theenergysignaturethatthingisgivingoffisfuckinginsane.Hieveryone,mynameisBrahma.”
Brahma’s 172-centimetre frame, slender build, and young, handsome face don’t bother Michael. It is the permanentsmileuponhisface,hiswholemannerismgivingoffthe‘Iwanttogettoknowyou’vibe,inafriendly,excitedway,thatannoysthecrapoutofhim.Michaelhasnotimeforadultswhoactlikechildren.
“Hey, we’ve got Brahmas back home in Texas, only they’re bulls. Where are you from?” Michael says to Brahma.
“I’m from India, the same place as the bulls.” Brahma snaps back at Michael, with an even bigger smile on hisface.
“Hi, I’m Tara.” An extremely attractive young lady says, stepping forward between both Michael and Brahma,thenlookingdirectlyatApollo.“Ican’tseeorhearanything,butIcanfeelitspresence,”sheadds,hervoicecarryingamuddledBritishaccent.

“I also sensed the message that we received when we placed our hands on the tree earlier. Are we all somehowmeantto…rectifytheworld?”Sheasks,lookingtotheothersforconfirmation.

“It’s Apollo,” he replies.

“Sophia!” she snaps. She is pissed at what she has just overheard Michael thinking about her. “I hear things thatarenotthere,orsomyfuckingpsychiatristandfamilyusedtotellme.”
“Nice to meet y’all,” says Michael.

Michael continues, “I ended up at this spot this morning ‘cause of some over-whelming feeling pushing me tobehererightnow.BestIcanexplainit—Ijusthadtobehere,eventhoughIdidn’tknowwhere‘here’was.”
He looks at Apollo again and says, “What about you?”
Apollo is standing dumbfounded, mouth slightly ajar, just staring at the group as if they were an alien invasionforce.‘Allfiveofushavepsychicabilities,’hethinks.
“Someone told me to follow this forest Sprite,” he manages to get out, gesturing toward the Sprite. “My deaduncleDavisintroducedittome,inthetownjustsouthofhere,”Apolloconcludes.

“I’m like you, Michael,” Tara interjects. “I just knew I had to be here, but had no idea where ‘here' was. It felt likeapressureonmyback,asifsomethingwerepushingmeforward.
Tara’s face saddens, and tears begin to build in her eyes. “It’s similar to the feeling that made me leave home, butthatwasmoreofapull,notapush,”sheadds,assherubsthewaterandtearsfromhereyeswithbothhands,tryingtocomposeherself.
Brahma jumps back into the conversation, the same excitement and energy as before. “I track energy loss signaturesfrompowergridsasajob.Icanseeenergyinmymind.”
Brahma pauses, takes a second to assess each of them, then continues. “I saw the energy emanating from this treeonaflyoveryesterday.IjustknewIneededtoseeitupclose.Then,earlythismorning,anurgencytoreturnawokeme,andIstartedwalking.”
Sophia, projecting both strength and callousness via her facial expressions and body language, although thisismoreadefenceagainstnewpeopleshehasdevelopedfromchildhood,says,“Iwasurgedbyoneofthevoicesinmyheadtobehere.”
She had been leaning against the Kauri tree for most of the conversation. Now she shifts her weight forward,steppingawayfromthetrunktogetaclearerviewofApollo.
Apollo seems captivated by Tara, his dark brown eyes fixed on her with a look of quiet wonder.
Tara, sensing others’ feelings, understands that Apollo isn’t trying to be creepy, although it certainly looks thatway.
He is unknowingly radiating desire—not the lustful kind that most men, and some women, project upon meetingTaraforthefirsttime,butsomethinggentler,deeper.It’sthequiet,awestruckyearningofsomeonewhobelievestheyunderstandwhatloveatfirstsighttrulymeans.

“Don’t worry, that happens to me more often than I care for, but at least you are a gentleman about it.” Tara laughsasshereachesupandbrushesApollo’sleftpectoralmusclewithherpetitelefthand.
Michael, still assessing the conversation in his head, asks, “Brahma, what did you mean by a flyover?”

Breakfast and a Drive for the Five
Entering the outskirts of Dargaville, they find a small café. There is little movement on the quiet street, onlyapasserbynowandthen,andnovehicletraffic.Theroadstillbearsthedampnessfromthepersistentdrizzlethathadjuststoppednotlongbefore.

Zoe activates the built-in computer within each table by swiping a pass card over the control panel near its centre,causingthecafé’smenutoflashontothesurfaceinfrontofeachperson.
“Let me know if you have any problems,” smiles Zoe. Then, she places her hand on Brahma’s shoulder and delicatelywhispers,“Thankyou,”intohisear,herlipsbrieflybrushinghisearlobe.
Now blushing, Brahma selects tea, pancakes, and a cupcake. Everyone else, whilst attempting not to smirk orlaughatZoe’sblatantshowofaffectiontowardhim,selectscoffeeandtheham,cheese,andtomatotoastedsandwich.
Tara cannot help herself and says, “Well, Brahma, she obviously likes a man who is good with his fingers.”
They all laugh, including Brahma.

“Around 9 o’clock,” she replies, after following the direction of Michael’s pointed arm. Zoe then turns, smilesagainatBrahma,andwalksbackinsidethecafé.
The entire group is buzzing with excitement regarding the experience they have all just been involved withthismorning,andthediscoveryofotherswithsimilaritiestothemselves.NoneofthemexceptforBrahmahadevermetanyoneelsewithabilitiessimilartotheirown.Untilnow.
Sophia takes a slow, deep sip of her coffee, looks at the cupcake in front of Brahma, then looks at Brahma himselfandsays,“SoIdon’tmeantocomeacrossasrude,okay,maybeIdo,butjusthowmanyofushavebirthdaystoday?”
Everyone looks at her, then at each other. Sophia raises her hand to show that she has a birthday, and then eachoneofthemalsoraisestheirhand.

The thoughts had come to Sophia as if she were hearing them being spoken to her, but of course, both BrahmaandTarawereinvolvedinotherconversationsandonlythinkingaboutwhatSophiahadheard.

“What do you think the significance is of us all having the same birthday?” Tara asks everyone.

Michael looks at everyone seated at the tables and says, “I got nothing, no clue why we all share the same birthday.”Heraiseshishands,palmsup,toemphasisehisshouldershrug.

“I’ve got the bill,” Sophia demands. She touches the wallet icon on her communicator, selects a cryptocurrencyaccount,thenactivatestheautomaticcurrencyexchangefunction,wavesherwristoverthetablecontrolpanel,andsettlesthewholebill.
They stand at the roadside curb waiting for Brahma’s vehicle, which is in self-driving mode, to arrive. Becauseitisonlyparkedtwoandahalfkilometresaway,thevehicle’sarrivaldoesn’ttakelong.
Their conversation turns to how they all understood they needed to go as soon as Sophia told them. They do notfeelstrangeoranxiousatall.Itjustseemsnatural,asiftheyareallbeingguidedinthesamedirectionbythesameforce.
Brahma’s car pulls up beside them, and they all climb in.

Ever since Toto had set up automated battery exchange stations instead of vehicle recharging stations fifteenyearsearlier,therehadbeenverylittlecompetitionfromotherelectricvehiclecompaniesanywhereintheworld.EventhebehemothTesla,whichhadbeenaroundfordecades,couldnotcompete.
Toto had simply started selling electric vehicles without adding the cost of the battery to the price of the vehicle.Thismadethesalesprice,lessthanhalfthatoftheclosestcompetitor.
They surprised everyone six years ago by introducing their new lightweight gel battery technology. The aviationmarketsforpersonal,military,andgeneralaviationquicklyexpanded,asdidthebatterynetwork.
Brahma had been the head advisor for the development of the gel battery project for Toto while still at university.Hecontinuedtoreceiveperksandbenefitswhereverhetravelledaroundtheworld.TotoinNewZealandprovidedhimwiththiscarandtheP.A.V.
“I see you are in manual driving mode. Why not just tell the car you want to head north?” questions Michael, whohastakenthefrontpassengerseatnexttoBrahma.
“I actually enjoy driving here in New Zealand. There is very little traffic compared to back home.” Brahma replies.“Thepowercellislowaswell,andIthinkIwilltopupbeforeleavingtown.”

After swapping the vehicle's battery out for a fully charged one, the group travels north on the Twin Coast DiscoveryHighwayforsomedistanceuntilTarafeelstheyneedtoturn.
“Brahma, you need to turn right onto the next road.” Tara informs.
Brahma turns right onto Waihue Road and travels only a short distance before Apollo instructs him to turn left.

As Brahma turns onto Maropiu Settlement Road, he notices a very large driveway and instinctively understandsthattheyaremeanttogothere.
Brahma stops the vehicle outside the front of a sizeable house. The massive front yard is full of blossoming treesandflowers.TherearemanyMaoriPouwhenuacarvings,ortotempoles,placedinvariousspotsaroundthegarden-scape.

Douglas looks over at the tall lady standing at the door, who seems to have reappeared from nowhere, and says, “Justchilledwater.Thankyou,Mary.”

Michael, A.K.A. Mystic Warrior
Born August 8th, twenty-four years earlier.
Well, y’all, I’m Michael Angelus. I was born to Sarah Walker and Samuel Angelus in Pecos, Texas. My birth wasstraight-forwardwithnocomplications,orsoI’mtold.TheonlythingoutoftheordinarywasanintenselightningstormthatoccurreddirectlyabovethehospitalasIwasbeingdelivered.Itplayedhavocwiththehospital’spower,lightsflickeringandall.
My mom, Sarah, was in love with Samuel, her boyfriend of three years. The same Samuel, who skipped townjustoneweekafterIwasborn,withanothergirlthathehaddeceptivelybeenseeingonthesideduringthepreviouseight-monthlead-uptomybirth.Itseemshedidn’tloveSarahasmuchasshelovedhim.
At the time of my conception and during the pregnancy, Sarah and Samuel had been living together, attemptingtoetchoutanexistenceinasemi-self-containedtinyhomecommunitylocatedwithinatrailerparkclosetodowntown.
My mom’s income, derived from selling the excess produce of my grandparents’ extended C.C.A.G. (PronouncedC-cag,itstoodforaClimate-ControlledAbovegroundGarden),wasfarmorethanSamuel’sasatransportattendantonboardaninterstatefreighttransporter.
A freight transporter is an electric self-driving truck-like vehicle that looks more like the sleekly designed enginesoftheoldbullettrains.Eachtransporterusuallyconnectswiththreetofivefreightpodsatanygiventime.
With my mom, Sarah, being unable to work, because of having me, a newborn baby to care for, and that dickheadSamuelwalkingoutonus,sheunderstoodthattherewouldnotbeanymoney
coming in to pay bills. She had no choice but to move us in with her parents, my grandparents, on the outer northernboundaryofthetown.
Each year, people felt the increasingly devastating effects of climate change closer to home, so Mom’s parents,likemanyothersfromtown,movedtotheoutskirtstoescapetherisingcostofliving.
My grandfather, Jeffery Walker, had built the new house underground to reduce the power consumption used for heatinginthewinterandcoolinginthesummer.Westillhadafrontdoorabovetheground.Itwasbuiltintotheflatfaceofadirthillthathadbeenexcavated,withastaircaseleadingdowntotheundergroundshelter.IwastoldmanytimesgrowingupthatthequalitysoilfromtheexcavationwasplacedintothegrowingbedsfortheC.C.A.G.(climate-controlledabovegroundgarden)
Garden was an understatement for what Grandpa Jeffery had created; his operation was so efficient that it not onlysuppliedourfamily’sneedsbutalsotheneedsofthelivestock,andprovidedanincomeforourfamilyfromthesaleoftheexcessproductbackintothelocalmarket.

further knowledge, I simply took a leaf from Bruce Lee’s own life, by combining all the fighting styles I had studied,andothersthatIhadresearched,intoastylethatIunderstoodasbeingformidable.Inafight,Ikickass.

Well, fuck. Accepting that I would not be receiving any help from the damned law enforcement, I began workingonaplantofindthosebastardsmyself.
After organising the funerals, cremations, and last wishes of everyone I had ever loved, I set off across Texas,searchingforthemenwhohadbrutallymurderedthem.

This book is dedicated to the women of all classes and ages who have shown the courage to let me interview them despite the ever-present threat of violent reprisal by their abusers. If they had not come forward, it would not have been possible for me to write and produce the Emmy-winning documentary, The Abused Woman, or author The Battered Rich, published by Ashley Books. Several women were in hiding with their children when interviewed at women resource centers financed by donations and operated by some of the most selfless individuals I have encountered during more than thirty years as a journalist. One counselor insisted that unless my book depicted the universal nature of physical, mental, verbal and emotional abuse, “Why in hell waste your time writing it.” I accepted her dare.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I do not think there has ever been a work of fiction written in a vacuum. The Passaic River Trilogy, being a historical work of fiction, required a vast amount of research. My thanks to librarians in five New Jersey communities - Newark, Newton, Elizabeth, Toms River and Freehold; and English-speaking academics in France, Portugal and Italy were more than generous with their help. Paul Patwell, renowned for digitizing the entire Newark Library System, offered encouragement and advice from the very start of my work on the Trilogy. Pete Noyes, a Peabody Award winner, a multi-Emmy recipient, and author of The Original L.A. Confidential was selfless with his advice. Christine P. Cappuccino, my right hand for fourteen years, accomplished the near impossible task of understanding a legally blind author given to occasional impatience. My wife, Darlene Chandler Bassett, whose faith salvaged the Trilogy’s first manuscript, has lovingly continued as my first reader and editor.

On the evening of Monday, August 18, 1947, everything became clear for Margie Bruning, she had to kill her husband before he killed her. His brutal assault that morning finalized her decision.
It had been months in the making. The progression was predictable. Shared frustration as days of fruitless job hunting grew into weeks, then months and Ned’s drinking began. He had become a lush, and her once bottomless love for him evaporated as his verbal abuse gave way to violence.
“Do you think I haven’t been looking?” Ned said as he was about to leave their apartment on another futile job search. He pulled up short, turned and grabbed Margie by the hair as slaps seared both her cheeks, “That’s what you fucking think that I’ve been out there playing around?”
The force of the blows spun Margie over the kitchen sink, where she blindly reached for the faucet to keep her balance. Once again, there was the taste of blood on her tongue.
Margie’s rage controlled every move she made. No, god damn it! Not this time. He’s not getting another cheap shot, she muttered to herself and without thinking, she turned from the sink and in one fluid motion, drove her right fist into his left temple.
“Now get the hell out of here. Yeah, you can beat the piss out of me, but it won’t be easy. Go on, scram!”
He turned and tenderly rubbed his swelling temple. This can’t happen. What the hell did she just do?
He was poised to throw his six-foot-two, two-hundred-and-ten-pound frame at Margie, but stopped when confronted by the woman in classic boxer stance, legs shoulder-width apart, both fists at the ready.
“To hell with it. Don’t think this is over yet cuz it ain’t,” Ned said, and shed of any dignity, slammed the door behind him as he left the kitchen. It was all over in fifteen seconds.
It took a few minutes for Margie to regain her equilibrium. She sat down at the kitchen table and with her right forearm, brushed aside the remains of Ned’s breakfast. She poured a cup of coffee, Zippo’d a Camel, inhaled deeply and as the smoke flattened like a fog across the table thought, How the hell did I let it get this goddamn far? Because I love him? And I believe he still loves me? That’s bullshit, so let’s face up to it. It’s time for me to get going while I still have the guts.
The man she had loved had fallen into an abyss of paranoia as he gradually discovered there was no longer any need for a former Marine Gunnery Sergeant with a Bronze Star and a Good Conduct medal.
There was little demand for a high school dropout, and even his low-level job as a forklift operator at Harrison Foundry ended. The Foundry’s owners had taken full advantage of Uncle Sam’s endless wartime generosity, invested wisely, put their once frenetically active plant up for sale and fled to Rumson. They joined the country club, took up polo and bought a newly restored Chris Craft yacht. Abandoned were two hundred and fifty blue-collar workers who sweated around the clock to forge spare parts for Sherman tanks, howitzers, and gun carriages. It didn’t take long for these men and women to realize they were trapped in a back-alley crap game with shaved dice.
This morning, she waited for the thud of Ned’s heavy footsteps to abate, certain it wouldn’t be long before he would be sharing cheap Muscatel with other Harrison Foundry lay-abouts. With the back of her right hand, she wiped the blood from her chin and felt with her tongue where the left lower incisor had ripped into her lip. A once unimaginable plan began to take shape.
Two weeks later, he took her by surprise in the kitchen with a right-hand blow to her left shoulder. She lost her balance, slammed into the refrigerator and slid to the floor. As Ned had warned, it wasn’t over yet.
“That’ll teach you to keep your goddamn trap shut. Keep your ass right where it is. You got one lucky shot in, better not try it again,” Ned said.
In the beginning, she believed that for Ned, the enemy was the bosses who padlocked their shops, warehouses and factories. She was wrong. Now she realized it was insane jealousy spurred by her accomplishments that were torturing him.
The Sears Cold Spot refrigerator that he had just bounced her off was one of several glistening surprises Margie bought for his homecoming, along with a Whirlpool washing machine that fit neatly into the far end of their bathroom. She got rid of the old wall-mounted, pull-chain toilet and replaced it with a new porcelain, self-contained flush model.
“Where did the dough for all this come from?” Ned asked after she had led him by the hand on a tour she was certain would end with a kiss and a hug. Not so.
“I earned the money, every cent of it,” she remembered answering. Her answer only increased his incredulity.
“You earned it? I knew you got a defense job at Todd Shipyards, but hell, this had to cost a lot.”
“Got it all on sale and that’s not all,” she said, taking a small black book from her apron pocket. Her pride echoed from every word as she thrust a New Jersey Bank & Trust bankbook to Ned. “Here, take a look. Seven hundred fifty smackers.”
“And I sacrificed to give you money every month,” an agitated Ned said, leafing through several pages of the deposit book. The veins in his neck and temples were close to exploding. “Jesus, fucking Christ! How’d you think I’d feel about this?”
“Don’t know if you realize it, buster, things have changed,” she said, at the same time pushing against him with her hip while rolling up the right sleeve of her blouse. “Here, feel this.”
She tightened her shoulder and forearm, pumped three times and guided his left hand to her undoubtable biceps. “Thirty months as a hot-rivet catcher-holder. Then they had me wrestling with ten lift and throttle levers in the cab of an overhead crane. Got a little raise, and said I would have fun working the crane. What bullshit.”
It was then that she got the first ominous hint as to where their marriage was going. She no longer recognized the man she had married, and she was now convinced that Ned could never accept the woman she had become.
Before Ned’s three years of overseas service, she had been hauling food trays, pushing food and liquor carts, and rearranging chairs and tables at the Hahne’s Department Store’s upscale Pine Room. A lithe, smooth-muscled body emerged strong enough to convince the misanthropic foreman at Todd Shipyards she could handle any slop jobs they gave her.
And it didn’t take long for Margie to convince dirty-minded creeps to get lost if they knew any better. That was proven at a Weehawken saloon not far from the shipyards.
2
The proof came just before the saloon closing when a drunk co-worker sidled up to her at the bar. “Nice tits, and a face that ain’t too bad, even without makeup,” the punk said. “Betcha, it’s nice down there, too don’t cha think?” he sneered, grabbing the crotch of Margie’s bib dungarees.
Using the dexterity she had earned as a riveter and crane operator, Margie pushed back, knocking over her stool, threw her beer in the guy’s face with her right hand, and landed a hard left-hand punch to his right temple. He lost his balance and landed on his ass.
Co-workers moved in, and it was all over in a few seconds. Margie picked up her stool, made her way down the bar and squeezed in between two welders who were still laughing after watching the mini-brawl. They made room, and the one on her right asked, “What’ll you have Margie? I’m popping for it.”
“In that case, it’s a boiler,” she said, then turned to the barkeeper who had set a coaster in front of her. “Make it a Four Roses with a tall Ballantine chaser.” She was the only one at the bar who realized it was more than a one punch slap-down. It was a matter of dignity, such as it was amid the camaraderie of wartime defense workers.
For the next fourteen months, Margie enjoyed the respect from her co-workers that the victory punch had given her. When she got her pink slip a month after VE Day, the new reality was like a fist to the gut. Shift boss Emil Sandowski, waiting at the timeclock, told the twenty-two women working for him to step aside for their male co-workers to pass through. When the last guy clocked-out, he motioned the women over, visibly pissed-off and embarrassed by what he had to do.
“I’m not gonna soft-pedal this,” Sandowski said, taking the top envelope from the stack on a table next to him. “Perkins. Here you are, Dottie. All I can say is….” He paused, searching for the words to express his feelings. “It’s one fucking shame, and the white-shirts in the office can shove it up their asses.”
Sandowski was saying goodbye to a family of women he had nurtured, grudging skepticism giving way to the hardnosed reality that as their physical strength and mental toughness increased, his gals were doing men’s work and in some cases doing it better.
He loved those posters of Rosie the Riveter warning Hitler, Tojo and Mussolini that they had bitten off more than they could chew. For three years, his admiration grew, and you didn’t have to look any farther than diminutive Angela Massima and Flo Simmons to see why. They weighed in at no more than one hundred and ten pounds but had to be seen to be believed as they positioned heavy steel plates for the welders and riveters, never complaining as they worked their asses off.
“So, this is it,” Margie said, removing her final paycheck from its envelope. “Whoa there, fifty-three bucks and eighty cents; I can’t remember any OT last week.” She turned to Sandowski with a wink and a smile, “You’re a sly dog, boss.”
Every family member reacted the same way, knowing that the extra gravy was the big Polack’s way to say thanks. Many of them teared up and didn’t care who saw them.
“Hey, none of that ladies. Now let’s get over to Barneys’ the drinks are on me.”
The laughing, damp-cheeked contingent followed their boss to the saloon, knowing their close-knit camaraderie was of the once-in-a-lifetime variety. Pushed aside, at least for tonight, were any thoughts of the subservience that would soon be expected from them. Don’t bet on it, pal.
It took months for Margie to reach the conclusion that it was all over for her and Ned. Thanks to the physical demands of her wartime work, she was muscular and agile, but she was no match for her husband, six inches taller, seventy pounds heavier, with long arms and fists as hard as rocks.
After making up the bed, she walked over to the smallest of three kitchen cupboards, pulled out the bottom drawer, and withdrew an object she hoped never to use. It was a gift from Eduardo Solano, a shipyard co-worker who worried for her safety after learning she lived alone at the corner of Fulton and Rector.
“Not good for you to live by yourself in such a neighborhood,” Eduardo said after they had hoisted a few cold bottles of Pabst Blue Ribbon at Barney’s. A week later, same time, same place, he pulled from under his peacoat his weapon of choice, sharpened and with a leather sheath, its Marine insignia clearly visible. He refused to take no for an answer, and after four turndowns, Margie accepted his gift, but only after he unsheathed it and put the handle in her right hand. “I saw you welding and know this is where you’re strongest.”
He waited until she had hefted it to her satisfaction and awkwardly jabbed its needlepoint blade into the empty darkness of the alley before grabbing it from her. “No, no. This stiletto is serious business, not for punching holes in dummies,” Eduardo admonished. “It’s simple, here I’ll show you. Push in all the way to the handle, and then you can twist up or down, side-to-side. All very easy,” the wiry, smooth-muscled Puerto Rican advised with a smile that acknowledged he spoke from experience. The war made for strange bedfellows.
During her three and a half years at the shipyards, Margie became one of the top dart players at the Weehawken saloon. A healthy part of the seven hundred and fifty dollars in her savings account was dart game winnings. It was a natural transition from darts to a perfectly balanced, razor-sharp stiletto that, from a distance of twenty feet, could split a three-inch target. She hoped never to use it, but here it was in its leather sheath, the perfect weapon.
Margie rewrapped the stiletto and returned it to its hiding place. God damn him down to hell if he forces me to do it. One more attack, and that’s it. Never again, I mean it this time, never again will I suck my own blood, she thought, as she washed her face, combed her hair and applied fresh makeup in the bathroom.
Satisfied with what she saw in the mirror, she went to the closet and removed her newest dress, a blue cotton shift, with three-quarter sleeves and white trim. The loose belted shift disguised her muscular stature and the sleeves, as intended, hid the bulge of her biceps. Sheer hose, white heels, a Bulova wristwatch, white gloves, a faux pearl two-strand necklace, and serving tongs earrings completed the ensemble.
She took a bus downtown, got off at Broad and Market, walked to Hahne’s Department Store, and after only a half-hour interview, she was hired as the late afternoon and evening Pine Room hostess, a high-profile job that paid more than twice her waitress salary, including tips. They had called her; she hadn’t called them. It had Rita Metcalf written all over it. Rita, a well-designed, still-closeted lesbian, had barely hidden her desire for Margie during her three years as a waitress. She and Margie shared a split of French Chablis in the Pine Room to celebrate, recounted what they had been doing for the past three years, then parted outside the store’s entrance with a soft kiss on the cheek from Rita. After her crucible of fire at Todd, Margie was confident she could handle this. Punches and slaps to the face were something else again, but now she had a plan, and she and the stiletto were waiting.

It was nine o’clock in the morning when Reginald Rouge awoke to the incessant ring of his bedside phone, a vintage Western Electric Imperial. He knew what it was, the predictable annoyance after one of his special facial camouflage sessions.
“This is Reggie Rouge?” the practiced timbre of his voice rarely failed to be reassuring. He was “Reggie” to his clients, no one knew him as Reginald, a name he hated, and “Reggie” was so much easier to remember, a trademark that he hoped would put him among the make-up artists’ Hall of Fame.
“Uh-uh, uh-uh. That’s good,” Reggie purred. “Exactly as I instructed. You have the kit with everything you need to get through this tragedy. Remember that the spirit gum and latex are meant to cover only the bruises on your cheek and neck, never on the cut. It’s superficial and will heal quickly with only an antiseptic and band-aid. If you have any questions, Mrs. Paasche, I’ll be here for you.”
Still listening, Reggie stretched the phone cord to its fullest and retrieved the August 20, 1947 final editions of the New York Daily Mirror and the Daily News from under the apartment front door. He then glided his snow-white, perfectly pedicured feet back to bed.
“That’s a wonderful idea, Mrs. Paasche. It makes no sense for you to stay at your New York City apartment when your family home is only a short drive away.” A box-score fanatic and bookie’s delight, Reggie was anxious to tackle the morning sports pages to see how the city’s three major league baseball teams did. “Drive carefully and let me know when you arrive.”
He waited for the click, puffed up two pillows against the headboard and scanned Tuesday’s baseball results.
“I’ll be a son of a bitch, there goes a quick Benjamin and a Grant,” Reggie raged out loud. He was finally making pretty good dough, but a hundred and fifty bucks was nothing to sneeze at.
It was a ten-year climb that began when he answered an ad for an apprentice in the make-up department at Universal Studios. His first job was to gofer for Jack Pierce, the make-up wizard, like none other in Hollywood, the monster-maker. Frankenstein, Dracula, Wolfman, and the Mummy made Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi, Lon Chaney and Lon Chaney, Jr., household names as the Halloween mask industry exploded.
It was Reggie’s good fortune that his first uncertain steps were onto the soundstage of a comedy starring Vincent Price in his screen debut. He marveled at how Pierce transformed Price’s image by simply attaching hair plugs on both sides of Price’s distracting widow's peak, giving him a full head of hair.
After almost a year of ignoring Reggie’s fawning pleas, Pierce finally gave in and allowed him to set aside his grunt work for half an hour every now and then to observe how he worked his magic. It took another year for Reggie to convince Pierce to give him a chance, a dab of rouge here, a beauty mark strategically placed there and, of course, lipstick, but only applied to extras with roles so small you better not blink or you’d miss them.
It was after one such practice session Pierce said, “Not bad, kid. What’s it been now, almost two years as my personal pain in the ass? You’ve become a passable technician, not yet an artist. But good enough for a real job somewhere else, not here or any Hollywood studio where the ass-kissers have things sewed up.”
“So, what the hell do I do?” Reggie implored. “It’s all your fault. This is going to be my life! You can see that, can’t you?”
“I’ve been thinking about it, kid. Ever think of New York and Broadway? I’ve got family, friends and contacts there. What do you say?” the Greek-born Pierce’s native accent, carefully hidden most of the time, popped to the surface.
Reggie studied his mentor’s face, not entirely sure he wasn’t just being blown off. Desperate, he snapped his make-up kit closed and said, “When can I get going?”
When the studio lights dimmed for the day, Pierce laid it all out for Reggie during a sit-down in his cluttered office.
“Here’s my brother and sister-in-law’s address. Sophia and Damen Piccoula. I’ll let them know you’re on your way.”
“Piccoula?” an amused Reggie said, even in Hollywood, a “Piccoula” turned “Pierce” is a stretch.
“Something funny about that?”
“No, no, nothing funny at all,” Reggie responded quickly hoping he hadn’t messed up his big chance. And when the session ended, he had a small bundle of file cards with the names of Broadway émigré, some big and important, other theater wannabes just like him. “Good luck,” he said as he put on his wrinkled linen jacket, picked up his make-up kit and extended his right hand.
“Luck is a crutch for the weak,” Pierce said. “I’ve got Wolfman and Phantom of the Opera already on the drawing board. Get going, kid.”
Reggie searched for the lowest bus fares and settled on Trailways with its special excursion rate that beat the hell out of Greyhound. So, for five days from grimy coach windows, Reggie discovered small-town America and hated it. When he emerged at the main bus terminal in midtown Manhattan, he knew what Lady Liberty meant when she said, “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.”
When he arrived at the door of the upper Broadway apartment, Damen Piccoula’s greeting was hardly warm. Not that he expected a welcoming, but certainly more than, “So you’re Janus’ make-up marvel. Well, come on in. My brother says you’re an okay guy, don’t prove him wrong.”
Damen gestured Reggie into the living room, and made no effort to relieve him of his scuffed, imitation leather suitcase purchased at a downtown Los Angeles pawn shop. A thin, well-proportioned woman of about forty-five emerged, her deep-set eyes atop high cheekbones were like two onyx-tipped gimlets that penetrated deep into Reggie.
A full-toothed smile softened her olive-skinned features, easing things up a bit, and Reggie appreciated the gesture. “Put your suitcase over there, you must be hungry, you can take care of it after you eat.” The three of them sat at the kitchen table where Sophia put out a steaming earthen pot of avgolemono, a garlic-laced lemon, rice and chicken soup. Reggie slurped two bowls, then wolfed down half a dozen dolmathakias, a traditional Greek appetizer. The lubricant was ouzo, an anise-flavored liquor that went down easy, but for many first-timers like Reggie, erupted noisily over the toilet. Much to Damen’s displeasure, Reggie abruptly called it quits.

His room was small but had a large window that looked out over Broadway with its never-ending human and vehicular traffic. It contained a small closet, more than ample for his meager wardrobe, a four-drawer bureau, a single bed, two cushioned chairs, and in one corner, a sink, toiletry shelf, small shaving mirror and a towel rack.
The next day, Reggie started working on the index cards Pierce had given him. The contacts were real, but he was kidding himself if he believed that dropping Pierce’s name was an “open sesame.” He was treated cordially, coming away with a perfunctory handshake and very little eye contact. For the next two years, he worked in the wings, accepting any job, burlesque in Jersey legit, off-Broadway and Summer Stock. But his big break came when he bedded down for two weeks in a storage room at the Paper Mill Playhouse just to see how Dorothy Kirsten, already a budding star at the Met, was made up for her role as Sonia in The Merry Widow.
“You there, come on over,” Kirsten’s rich soprano was barely muted when she insisted during a rehearsal break, “Yes, you. I won’t bite.”
Surprised that Kirsten was calling him over, Reggie put down his coffee cup, hitched his trousers with John Wayne aplomb and sauntered over to where Kirsten and her entourage, including make-up artist Gus “the Brush Man,” sat in a tight circle. They had worked the theater dodge for years and recognized fake insouciance when they saw it. Since Reggie was not a threat, their greetings were warm.
“I watched you huffing and puffing with the scenery and props,” Kirsten said, reaching out to take his hands in hers. “Let’s take a look. I don’t see any hammers, saws or callouses. What’s your name?”
“Reginald Rouge, but all my friends and colleagues call me Reggie.”
“Colleagues? Tell me, what’s your line? Certainly not this. So, give, you have showbiz written all over you.”
“Make-up. Earned my spurs sweating it out for Jack Pierce at Universal. He could be a bastard, but a real master at his craft. Couldn’t have a better mentor.”
“Pierce, the Monster Maker,” the Brush Man said. “Not much call on Broadway for mummies, bloodsuckers, hoof-footed monsters with spike heads and wolfmen.”
“Lay off, Gus,” a young, very pretty brunette member of the entourage admonished. “You were there once yourself. Can’t hurt if you push Reggie in the right direction.” There were nods all around the circle.
Reggie and Gus never got close, but over the next year, there was a growing appreciation by the Brush Man that this Hollywood dropout would take his make-up kit anywhere there was a job, no matter how small. He willingly accepted pauper’s pay from NBC for dabbing the faces of would-be television talent.
Oklahoma opened on Broadway in March 1943, an immediate box office success. Anyone working on the Rodgers and Hammerstein blockbuster could cash-in their stage credit at any bank in town. Reggie put the Brush Man’s recommendation to work, getting one of the three openings for make-up technicians to work on minor cast members. One of them was Bambi Linn, a seventeen-year-old ingenue who snared the minor role of Aggie.
During rehearsal, they nurtured a show business camaraderie that allowed secrets to filter through the banter typically shared during downtime. During their first make-up session, Brooklyn-born Bambi self-consciously rolled up the right sleeve of her gingham dress, the stage costume for her brief scenes on stage, to expose a black and blue bruise. It took only a few minutes for it to disappear under Reggie’s latex and make-up magic.
“How did you get this?” he asked, making eye contact as he gently touched the area around her bruise. “Does this hurt? If you want me to hide it, there’ll be some pressure.”
“Yeah, it does, but nothin’ like my knee when I crashed my bike into a goddamn trash can,” Bambi said, her Brooklyn street lingo surfacing. “This time, it was that stage backdrop, that one over there. Wasn’t looking when they were moving it into place.”
“Better start looking; it’s hectic as hell backstage,” Reggie said as he completed Bambi’s shoulder camouflage.
“I’m just a kid learning the ropes,” Bambi said.
“Been thinking about that, how a kid like you got a plum role in a big Broadway musical.”
“Dumb luck. A nervous little agent named Abe Grosser spotted me and liked what he saw. My mom and dad signed on the dotted line, and he began peddling me to producers, directors and writers at all those boring cocktail parties. Abe made sure the word was out that I was perfect for the Aggie role.
“One night, I was nursing a Shirley Temples while high-borne ladies were guzzling the real stuff. Most of them were just rich hangers-on who got goosebumps rubbing shoulders with theater-types.
“That’s when this rich, gorgeous lady came over, and out of the clear blue, started talking real low and confidential, ‘If Abe’s telling the truth, you’re a lucky gal. So young with only bright lights ahead if you play it right. I wish I could say the same.’”
“Tell me everything,” Reggie, a born gossip-monger, implored.
It took less than five minutes for Bambi to lay it all out, how Mrs. Paasche, who had been inhaling her drinks but not slurring her words, described how her brute of a husband, Johan, had made the transition from verbal to physical abuse. Bambi learned that Johan was not the only rich and famous brute who shared silk sheets with a wife he slapped around for exercise.
“Now, this is what really floored me,” Bambi said, “She actually pulled aside her pearl necklace and showed me a bruise on her neck. That was two weeks before rehearsals began, but I was thinking about it all along, especially when she said three friends were being slapped around and afraid to go out sporting their bruises.”
“That’s crazy! Did Mrs. Paasche say why she and the others didn’t up and leave? They’re not tenement punching bags who show-up at the local police precinct with bruises and blackeyes,” an agitated Reggie said. “They are real ladies trapped, stuck with misfits whose wages put clothes on the kids and food on the table.”
Bambi saw that Reggie barely controlled the growing anger that coursed from head to toe, the balls of his feet rat-tap-tapping, his fingers tightly entwined and his face taking on the red shine of a Delicious apple.
“I hope you’re not talking from experience?” Bambi said. “That would be horrible.”
Bambi had her answer when Reggie silently turned away and peered into the dark theater and labored over what to say. Words would open family wounds he had left three thousand miles away and had no intention of reinflicting.
“Let’s change the subject, shall we? We can start with a question. Are you the one who put Mrs. Paasche onto me?” Reggie said. “I wondered how she got my name.”
“Yes, that was me. They all belong to the watercress sandwich and tea for lunch bunch, where there are no dirty little secrets. Mrs. Paasche brought your name up, and it spread like a miracle headache remedy they had been waiting for. How‘d you feel if one of them asked you to work your magic, as you did on my shoulder? I can give you one name and number right now. You can name your own price.”
Reggie took a slip of paper with all the personal data from Bambi. It was the first of twenty such notes and phone calls he would receive, several from repeat customers, over the next four years. Each carried a sizeable price tag.

If the denizens of Manhattan were looking for a near-perfect summer day, they couldn’t look much farther than Wednesday, August 20, 1947. Except for some wispy clouds lingering four miles above, the skies were clear and visibility to the north was unlimited. At nine-thirty that morning, the mercury on the terrace of Deborah’s twelfth-floor Riverside Drive co-op read seventy-five degrees.
She closed and locked the second of two steamer wardrobe trunks stenciled Deborah Hammerstein Paasche and motioned to the two burly men waiting in the foyer to come and get them. Mayflower Van Lines would deliver the two trunks to the Hammerstein family mansion in Tuxedo Park thirty miles up the Hudson.
She had just gotten off the phone with Reggie. Yesterday was the third time he had performed his make-up magic. The first two times, her husband, Johan, had left her with only bruises, but this time his diamond-encrusted wedding band had sliced through the skin over her right cheekbone. The two cuts were small and could be easily explained, one band-aid was sufficient. Now came the test as to how well she had followed Reggie’s instructions.
Deborah made sure the trunks were secure, then turned to the two moving men, handed the trunk keys to the older one and signed the clipboard he extended for her signature. She searched his and his helper’s faces for any signs that her disguise had failed. There were none. She had passed with flying colors.
Buoyed by her success, she doubled her intended tip from ten to twenty dollars. “Thanks a lot, Mrs. Paasche. We’ll be quick and careful, the trunks will be waiting when you arrive home,” the driver said.
The co-op, with its two treasured underground parking spaces, was in her name. It was free and clear, but Johan, ever a bottom-feeder, would sleaze his way into laying claim.
What the hell was wrong with me? What a sap. I was never one of Katherine Anne Porter’s magazine ingénues who goes gaga over a smooth-talker. She never noticed that her white knight was riding a rented horse.
Thinking back, Deborah still marveled at how it had taken less than two hours of dancing, joking and the sharing of small confidences for the tall, handsome Johan to captivate her at a college tea dance in the spring of 1938. He was twenty-five, she was twenty-one and in her final year at Vassar, a comfortable forty-five-mile drive from the Hammerstein mansion in Tuxedo Park. They were married nine months later and honeymooned amid the castles of Bavaria.
It puzzled her that Johan, coming from a family with pacificist leanings, had chosen for their two weeks of bucolic lovemaking a region with warrior instincts and unbending support for Adolf Hitler. Within a few days, it became clear to her that he cared little for river cruises, historic castles or towering mountains.
She felt abandoned when he left her with a tour guide in the picturesque Danube River town of Regensburg after climbing aboard a speed boat with two dark men she didn’t know. They were a matched pair, each about three inches shorter than her six-foot husband. White shirts, Windsor-knotted black ties outlined by the lapels of gray suit jackets poked from under smartly tailored black overcoats. Well-brushed, dark, snap-brimmed hats and expensive black wingtips completed the ensemble.
To Deborah, they came across as two thugs who worked hard to dress up their image. They failed. Under their cocked hats, their swarthy faces betrayed them. They nodded in her direction with the practiced, tight smiles that had made James Cagney, George Raft and Edward G. Robinson famous. Johan waved and threw her a perfunctory kiss as the boat sped away in the direction of Munich.
Two nights earlier, a courier had knocked heavily on the door of the Paasches’ hotel suite. Debbie checked the bedside clock wondering who in hell would be pounding on the door at two o’clock in the morning. She thought it better not to disturb Johan and, in only a thin negligee and slippers, padded over to the door, released the lock, grabbed the ivory and gold-plated doorknob, pulled the door halfway open and confronted the pop-eyed courier who couldn’t take his eyes off the plunging gown that partially exposed her dark nipples. “This better be good, buddy. Hand it over.”
“I’m sorry, Madame, but I have orders that only, let’s see now,” he studied the name on the small manilla package, “that only Johan Paasche should receive this, that his signature is necessary.”
By this time, a groggy and angry Johan came to the door and, in German said, “I’m Johan Paasche. Give me it.” He was surprisingly rebuffed.
“Only after the signature,” the uniformed young man said, removing the cap from his pen, along with a receipt pad. “Sign here and date it, please.”
“Can you beat that,” Debbie said as she followed her husband into the bedroom. “A kid pounds on our door, gets us out of bed, and then starts ordering you around.”
Johan replied with a shrug, opened the package with a letter opener and scanned the first two pages. He turned and kissed both of her cheeks, “This is too important to put off. Go to sleep, and you’ll have forgotten it all tomorrow.”
The first thing that caught his eye was the letterhead on the top sheet of the three-page memo: Hotel Nacional du Cuba, Calle 21 y O, Vedado, Plaza, La Habana, Postal Code: 10400, Cuba.
Paasche’s photographic memory was put to good use as he sped through the single-spaced pages. The last paragraph made it clear to him the identity of the writer. Who else would have the precise details of an illegal international investment scheme that, to his knowledge, had never been attempted before. This was a very smart guy who took no chances.
“After digesting the foregoing information, I am confident you understand why it is not necessary to attach a name to this memo. In two days, at nine o’clock in the morning, two colleagues fresh from a trip that took them from Havana to Naples to Munich, will invite you into their boat at dockside outside your hotel. If you climb aboard, you will be entering a world of great consequences and great payoffs.”
Johan returned the memo to its envelope before joining Debbie, who was only faking sleep in bed. He snuggled up, ran a moist tongue into her right ear, turned her chin slightly upward, and inserted his tongue for a long goodnight kiss. He said nothing about the memo, and during her tossing and turning, Debbie discovered that he had placed it not only under his pillow but inside the pillowcase. Upon arising, he dropped it into his attaché case and snapped it closed.
After watching the boat with Johan and the two thugs disappear into the haze that shrouded the Danube, Debbie began quiet sleuthing of her own. She learned the two men had arrived in Munich from Naples a few days earlier. Johan’s sudden departure was for a pre-arranged meeting in Munich with top officials of the National Bank for Deutschland, a huge international money broker that owed much of its growth to his mother’s family. Awaiting the trio was a Daimler-Benz limo, complete with chauffeur, two armed bodyguards in the front seat and two blonde female ornaments in the back. It took some mild pressure to convince her father, Lee Hammerstein, to contact brokerage and banking stalwarts in Munich to keep an eye out for Johan. It was a dangerous time in Europe, and Debbie was worried for his safety.
She had no way of knowing she needn’t worry. Her husband was about to meet with officials of several large German companies who had jumped on the Hitler bandwagon and with his knowledge, were devouring all German corporations of less than $40,000, stripping them of their assets while they got fat on government contracts and low-interest loans.
In 1939, fueled by the blood of murdered rivals, America’s Mafia Commission and the Nazis (Germany’s Social Democrats) were in bed together. The Mafia, with Jewish financial wizard Meyer Lansky, pulling the strings and the Nazis, under the tutelage of Herman Göring and Walther Funk, were in pursuit of cash.
For two days, telegrams and phone calls from both sides poured into the Regina Palast Hotel around the clock. The mismatched negotiators arrived at a simple and logical formula.
Lansky was looking for safe and profitable ways to launder the endless supply of cash generated by the Mafia throughout America and the growing treasure chest in Cuba. He saw no better investment than Germany’s rapidly expanding public works, armament, shipbuilding and chemical industries powered by inexhaustible slave labor. It was a cornucopia of plenty. The money would be funneled through the National Bank for Deutschland, where Deborah’s mother-in-law, Ellen Witting Paasche, held sway, and her son Johan, with Swiss, U.S. and German citizenship and passports, would have little trouble being the transatlantic bagman.
Once in the hands of M.L. Kraus and Topf & Sons, the money powered their industrial expansion and a Swiss investment portfolio that brought greedy smiles to the faces of Lucky Luciano, Frank Costello and Vito Genovese, the former “Boss of Bosses,” who had fled to Naples to escape his murder conviction in New York.
The money was split 50-50 between Switzerland and Germany, a country criminally controlled by an insatiable lunatic with a comic opera mustache who viewed the world as his.
On August 20, 1947, Deborah Hammerstein Paasche handed over two suitcases, a pair of hat boxes, the leather satchel with her make-up kit, and the Daimler-Benz keys to her co-op doorman. She knew there was no need to worry about getting rid of Johan.
She wanted no part of the apartment, and except for her personal belongings, he could have it all, including the parking spaces. It might be an impossible task to erase all the memories of Johan, but she’d give it a damn good try.

Johan’s innumerable trips to Switzerland and Germany, and of all places, New Jersey, transformed their apartment into no more than a stopover. Only once did she accompany Johan on his clandestine trips, and it was not to Germany but to Newark. After the fleeting encounter on the Danube and her husband disappearing upriver to Munich, she could understand the trips to Germany, but New Jersey, this was a real eye-opener.
He prefaced this trip by pleasantly but firmly asking her to take all the mental notes she wanted but never to mention it. She agreed but had to bite her lip to do so because of how unbelievably bizarre the dinner in Newark was. This was a world she had seen in the movies, the only things out of sight were tommy guns and pistols.
“We’re taking a little trip today, I’m certain you’ll find it enjoyable and, yes, even thought-provoking,” Johan said off-handedly as he dug a silver demitasse spoon into his soft-boiled egg, cooked perfectly at one hundred ninety degrees Fahrenheit by their maid Tisha. “For both of us, it will be a journey of discovery.”
“So glad you tuned me in, just where is this wonderful ‘journey of discovery’ taking us?” Deborah said sarcastically. “How long ago did you hatch this up without telling me?”
“It’s only across the river to Newark. I know you’ve never been there, so this provides an excellent opportunity to see how the other half lives.”
“Newark! What in hell is so damn important in Newark that necessitates a visit and dragging me along, no doubt for window dressing?”
“Debbie, you’re not only the most beautiful creature I’ve ever known, but your intuition continues to astound me.” Johan decided the best way to counter spousal sarcasm was a rakish rejoinder. He studied Debbie’s face. Ah yes, it had worked again.
“Alright, you’re beginning to win me over,” she replied. “Is there anything else I must wrap my intuitive mind around?”
“Only one request, I want you to dress your sexiest,” Johan said, his words little more than a soft, purring whisper. “Dig into your wardrobe and pull out the clingiest and most enticing dress. You know what I mean, refined upper-class sluttiness.
“When you meet the other ladies tonight, you’ll see what I mean.”
It was three-thirty in the afternoon of April 16, 1939, just two months after the Paasche wedding, when Johan took the keys to the Daimler-Benz from the parking attendant just as another co-op flunkie opened the front passenger door for Mrs. Paasche waited for her to be comfortably seated, then gently closed it. Mr. Paasche took the beautiful machine onto Riverside Drive, heading toward 39th Street and the recently completed Lincoln Tunnel.
“Well, here we are, about to enter the dark wilderness of New Jersey,” Johan said. “Excited?”
“Curious is a better way to put it. New horizons are my steak and potatoes,” Debbie said, then added playfully, “Yippy I Yo Kyai, I’m an old cowhand!”
Johan failed in his effort to keep a straight face, turned to Debbie and let loose a loud guffaw that kicked off a giggling spasm that she made no effort to control.
“Where have I heard that before, familiar, but I can’t quite place it,” he said.
“From the Old Crooner himself, Bing Crosby,” Debbie said, her emerald green eyes sparkled mischievously atop perfect cheekbones that dominated her flawless face.
She shifted across the front passenger seat and brushed her hand along his right thigh before turning her attention to the gaping tunnel mouth.
Barely two years old since its ribbon-cutting, the tunnel was still shiny and new despite the noxious clouds of progress that spewed from the trucks, moving vans, buses, taxis, cars, and motorcycles passing westward through its entrails to God knows where. Debbie could sense her husband’s impatience, even appreciate it, as he slowly guided a mechanical marvel built for speed bumper-to-bumper with a meat delivery truck in front and a semi-trailer trapping him from behind.
Midway through the tunnel, Debbie unfolded a sheet of instructions Johan had prepared, scanned it to her satisfaction and said, “Okay, this cowhand is ready. Let’s get our chuckwagon moving.”
She has no idea how important tonight’s meeting is to our future, Johan thought, and let’s hope it stays this way. A smiling Johan couldn’t ask for more shared levity that masked the reason for their trip.
He steered around the meat truck and maneuvered through the jumbled traffic spilling from the tunnel and spreading voraciously like gypsy moths through the streets of Weehawken.
Debbie guided them through a series of depressing blue-collar towns, finally crossing the Passaic River into Newark. He pulled to the curb on Broadway, switched off the ignition, removed an inscribed platinum cigarette case from an inside jacket pocket, offered a Benson & Hedges to Debbie and took one for himself.
After a few deep drags, she turned to her husband and said, “So, here it is, wondrous Newark. It’s about time, wouldn’t you say, to let me in on what the hell is going on?”
“Remember those castles during our honeymoon in Bavaria? Well, you’re about to dine at another one right here in Newark. It’s called Vittorio’s Castle. It’s the first time for both of us.”
“Oh brother, a castle in Newark. Are you serious? From what you suggested for my wardrobe tonight, I have a pretty good idea of the kind of ladies I’ll be chit-chatting with. What about the men?”
“Remember the two fine chaps that I met at dockside in Regensburg? My guess is that we can expect more of the same tonight.”
It was five o’clock when they arrived at the corner of Summer and Eighth Avenue, and sure enough, there it was, Vittorio’s Castle, complete with four corner towers, topped with turrets that rose above the roofline of the three-story brick building.
They had barely pulled to a stop at the corner when a phantom valet materialized out of nowhere, and with an obsequious smile creasing, his dark, oily face bowed as he opened Debbie’s door. “Mrs. Paasche, please let me help you,” gently taking her right hand to guide her over the curb.
7
It took less than a minute after they were ushered into the Castle’s dining room for Debbie’s anxiety to escalate into fear, a feeling she rarely experienced.
Standing at a circular bar, drinks in hand, were the two swarthy men who had been waiting for Johan in Regensburg. They and four others formed an all-male, cookie-cutter tableau: dark suits, white shirts, black ties, pomaded hair, pinky rings, oversized wristwatches, and black shoes buffed to a professional shine.
Their women were sitting isolated at a long marble cocktail table prominently centered out of earshot of their men. Their appearance held no surprises for Debbie. Everything about them was what she expected, from their lacquered hair to deep décolletage, over-abundant jewelry and pampered red fingernails.
As if a silent cue had been given, once the men had finished their drink, the women arose from their table. Debbie and Johan watched with bated breath as the jewel-encrusted entourage advanced in lockstep to the dining table by their host, Ruggiero “Richie the Boot” Boiardo and his son, Tony Boy.
“Everyone’s here, and I’m hungry,” the senior Boiardo said. “Except for our special guests who’ll be sitting next to me, there are no special places; grab a seat and get comfortable, that’s what my castle is for: comfort, good food and….” He paused, crinkled a smile as he sized-up the uncertain faces around the table, then added, “Compagnia di amici di cui ti fidi, and if a person can’t be trusted, he shouldn’t be breathing.”
“And we don’t have too much good air here in Newark to share it with punks,” Tony Boy said as he slid into his seat at the far end of the table from his father. As if attached to a master puppeteer’s strings, there were nods all around as ten chairs glided across the highly polished, white and black checkered tile. White damask napkins were unfolded, cigarette cases clicked open, fags were fired up, and deep drags created a gray nimbus that wafted across the table thick enough to mask the studied, furtive looks directed their way.
“Deborah, it’s okay to call you Deborah? I’m not being pushy or anything like that am I?” entreated a lacquered, high-bonneted blonde two places to the left of Debbie. “I’m Roslyn, but everyone calls me Rosie.”
“Oh, I think Deborah is a little too fancy. If you’re Rosie, then I’m Debbie,” she said, uncertain where to go next, but for Johan’s sake, more than willing to give it a good try. I have no idea how to talk to these women, she thought. What the hell!
Easy now, time for a smile, not too many teeth but wide enough to look like I mean it, these gals can spot a phony a mile away.
Four waiters busied themselves pouring from bottles of robust Chianti, a lighter Toscana Sangiovese and a vintage Lambrusco, then placed the bottles on the tables within easy reaching distance of the guests. A patois took shape as Italian and English remarks were exchanged, the men keeping mainly to themselves, their unmistakable Sicilian dialect taking over whenever their features darkened and their tone became lugubrious.
The women were entrapped by their curiosity, crowding Debbie with one banal question after another, never giving ground until they got an answer. Isabella Bonini, “just call me Izzy,” was fascinated with her tight-fitting, full-length, black Chanel silk gown.
“Your dress, Debbie, it’s really beautiful. I think my shape is good enough for it,” Izzy said. “Point me in the right direction, where can I pick one up?”
“Well, I ordered this one from Saks. They had it shipped to me for our six-month anniversary.”
“Saks, I’ve heard the name, but I don’t think there’s one around here,” Izzy said. “How about the fancy suburbs, maybe Upper Montclair or West Orange? We’ve got a Hahnes here in town, real fancy and expensive. Would it be anything like Saks?”
What the hell do I say to that, Debbie thought.
“I’ve heard of Hahnes, that it’s a great store and women love it, but I don’t honestly know if they handle the same merchandise as Saks.”
The banal chit-chat was interrupted at one point when Tony Boy snapped his fingers, and a liveried waiter produced two framed photos.
“Pop, do you want to do the honors, or do you want me to take over?” Tony Boy nodded toward the far end of the table where Richie the Boot looked up from his antipasto and gestured his son to get on with it.
I’ll be damned if he doesn’t look like he’s ready to burst out in song. What comes next, La Donna ė Mobile? Debbie thought as she watched Tony Boy push back his chair and take the two gilt-framed photos.
Tony handed off one framed photo to his right and the other to his left, each one making the rounds before Johan and Debbie had a chance to study them, a beaming Richie between them.
“Here’s proof that Vittorio’s Castle is class with a capital C,” Tony Boy bellowed. “There he is, Joe DiMaggio, the Yankee Clipper himself, enjoying the best food in Jersey after closing a deal with my dad for his lucky bride-to-be’s engagement ring! And there she is, movie star Dorothy Arnold, sitting with the Clipper right here at this table just a few months ago.”
“And he’s brought his Yankee buddies with him more than a couple times,” his father added, as one waiter cleared his empty plate and another placed a steaming dish of Chicken Marsala in front of him.
It was more than an hour later when all four courses of the meal were completed, and the men and women went their separate ways, the men to his father’s office, Debbie and the four women consort to a lounge where they set up camp amid a cluster of overstuffed chairs and sofas specially arranged for them. They were safely out of the way as it should be, caring nothing about the business but enjoying the endless supply of gaudy baubles that came their way. During the next ninety minutes, Debbie learned more about the little tricks that make men happy than she could have ever imagined.
Reports of what transpired in the closed-door office meeting were eagerly awaited in two cities separated by thousands of miles but linked by the same deadly criminal intent.

At the presidential palace in Havana, three men appreciated the best rum in the world and a fourth sipped Dewar’s scotch from a Bohemian crystal tumbler. They were bound by a shared belief that drugs, prostitution, pornography, loan sharking, extortion, and if necessary, murder, were the branches of an ever-blossoming money tree.
Their confab was hosted by Fulgencio Batista, the strong man for a corrupt military that controlled every aspect of Cuban life and a sure winner in the upcoming presidential election. The sitting president, Frederico Laredo Brù, a puppet in the hands of Batista, was stepping down after four years in office, during which American gangsters had turned Cuba into their private piggy bank.
The meeting was pieced together by Mafia financial wizard Meyer Lansky, the diminutive, soft-spoken, even-tempered scotch drinker who had long realized that Havana’s streets were lined with gold. He was joined by Amleto Battisti, the short Cuban mafia gambling czar, who spoke in hushed tones but was a giant when it came to numbers, profit and loss.
“If everything goes according to plan and we hear the right things about this guy, I think we’ll be ready to go,” Amleto said to no one in particular, letting his words absorb the lush Cuban cigar smoke and the sweet aroma of rum and scotch that filled the palatial room. “Vito is confident his boys did a good job screening him in Munich.”
“This guy has the tools – tall, blonde, blue-eyed, a streak of larceny, family contacts, and a bank that couldn’t be better for us,” Lansky said, savoring a sip of scotch and the woody chestnut flavor of his Cuban Panetela. “Vito’s boys better be right. Fulgencio and I have locked things down here in Cuba for years to come, and we’ve got five greedy families from coast-to-coast scratching their scrotums in anticipation.”
Batista and Brù had been silently listening to Lansky until the military strongman couldn’t hold back any longer. He turned to a small man wearing black horn-rimmed glasses and a rakish fedora who had been listening but saying nothing.
“Amleto Battisti, I know you, but do I trust you?” He turned to Lansky, “Mr. Lansky, yes, we’ve talked but I still don’t know you very well,” then sat back in his chair to assess the two men. “Are you telling me that things aren’t sewed up tight yet? It’s not really what you’re telling me, is it?”
“Relax. Haven’t I always come through for you, of course, with the help of your well-chosen man here,” Lansky flicked his thumb in the direction of President Brù. “Hotel Nacional, millions poured into the Sevilla Biltmore, how we’ve lighted up the Paseo del Prado like nothing before. You wanted more land, so we got it and kept your name out of it.”
“Son of a bitch, if I don’t think that you believe only a little Jew bastard like you could pull it off,” the thirty-nine-year-old, slim and handsome Batista threw his contempt directly into Lansky’s expressionless face. “Around here, I just snap my fingers, and I have my choice of bagmen.”
“I understand. You’re talking about Cuba, we’re talking global, and with this guy who can travel anywhere with his passports, we have one of the most respected banks in Europe lined up. Let’s enjoy our drinks and smokes and not jump to any conclusions until we hear from Vito’s guys, get a solid opinion from Richie the Boot, and take things from there,” Lansky said. “If we need another bagman, we’ll off the blue-eyed blonde and start again.”
It was late June of 1940. In four months, puppet-President Brù would be voted out, and an unscrupulous military strongman would join hands with a criminal cartel in the rape of a country. And as far as they were concerned, the Cuban people be damned.
Both sides were so good at their jobs that they were finding it difficult to hide the tens of millions of dollars rolling in both from the mainland and the new cornucopia of plenty, Cuba.
This was only the beginning for Lansky. For six years, he had scrutinized how Hitler, a man he loathed, had been using public works, illegal disarmament, rebirth of the navy and army to transform Germany into a military and industrial colossus. The nation’s industrial and commercial elite hated Hitler but loved it when he expressed his loathing of the “bureaucratic management of the economy” and pumped the pulse of German autocrats, friends and foes alike, to heart attack levels when he decreed, “The basic feature of our economic theory is that we have no theory at all.” Fat cat greed was the order of the day as smaller competitors were eliminated, tax rates were lowered, and lucrative government contracts were for the taking. This was a financial dream world for Lansky, who had warned for more than a decade that the mafia’s lucre had to be hidden or legally invested to keep it from the feds. What better hiding place than Germany’s free-booting economy?
More than five thousand miles away and across two bodies of water, Vito Genovese hung up the telephone, removed his thick-lensed, metal-framed glasses, wiped them with his handkerchief, and relaxed his five-foot-seven inch, one-hundred-and-sixty-pound frame into the soft tufts of a green, brocaded sofa and smiled. He had just talked with his second wife, Anna, at her Club Caravan, the centerpiece of the Mafia-controlled queer bars in Manhattan. Vito loved her enough to murder her second husband, Gerard Vernotico, gangster-style, so he could have her. He trusted her implicitly and marveled at how she sized up every situation. He ordered his two goons to funnel the news from Vittorio’s Castle through her, and they knew her opinion would govern his decision.
“No doubts? No questions at all?” Vito said, the line to Anna’s underground queer haven on West Broadway was surprisingly clear. “It’s the second time Giuseppi and Rosario have had a crack at him. Had some doubts in Munich, but no more.”
He listened as Anna’s controlled voice offered him two imperatives.
“You’ve got everything I’ve got. I’ll make sure the word gets hand-delivered to Lucky’s cell at Dannemora. And if he doesn’t trust Mr. Blue-eyes, he can have a couple of his soldati check him out. But why?” Anna said. “There’s no blood oath here, and if you like, I can….”
“Don’t go no further,” Vito said, betraying his fifth-grade education in nearby Naples. “I’ll get word to Luciano if I got to. And you, la mia dolce cosa, you did good. Let’s leave it there.”
“Do you miss your dolce cosa? It’s been three years, lover boy.”
“You know it. Just grab hold of a couple of the good-looking queers, big mean bastards, to get you out and around, and you’ll be okay; I’m not worried. Arrivederci.”
“Arrivederci.”
He arose and walked to a sideboard along the interior wall of the high-ceilinged room that looked out through two glass paneled doors onto the Alpine forest that spread out for miles below Nola. Despite its Elysium beauty, Genovese hated everything about it. With three-quarters of a million dollars in mob swag, he had returned to his childhood home in 1937 to avoid a New York murder rap for arranging the killing of mobster Ferdinand Boccia.
He opened the top of a handcrafted Dunhill mahogany and teak humidor and inhaled deeply the rich aroma of the very best Cuban Coronas. He then reached for the gold cigar cutter and snipped the rounded head, lifted a gold Dunhill from its assigned place next to the humidor and fired up. To complete the ritual that began almost three years ago, he raised, closely examined and then kissed the simply framed photos of Anna, his stepdaughter Marie, Nancy, his daughter with his first wife, and Phillip, his and Anna’s only child.
This was hardly a sentimental gesture by a sadistic thug whose murderous urges had propelled him to the top of the Masseria Manhattan crime family before he and Lucky took it over. Instead, the ritual with the photos honed to perfection his obsession for revenge. His two betrayers, Jerry Esposito and Peter LaTempa, the stoolies who ratted him out to the cops, would never see a courtroom, and the Genovese family would be back together again.

It was ten-thirty in the morning of August 20, 1947, when two well-rehearsed but seemingly unrelated events were about to happen. In downtown Newark, newly-minted Police Lieutenant Kevin McClosky was on his way to police headquarters to cry on the shoulder of his former, long-time partner, Captain Nick Cisco, now the head of homicide. In upper West Side Manhattan, Deborah Hammerstein Paasche tooled her Daimler-Benz along Riverside Drive toward the George Washington Bridge and a new but very uncertain future.
“He’s expecting you. Go right in,” a young, brunette cop nodded at McClosky from her desk just a few steps outside and to the right of the open door to Cisco’s office. “There’s fresh coffee brewing in the bullpen, interested?”
“That’s one hell of a change from the death-dealing sludge we were used to,” McClosky said. “If he does nothing else, Nick hit the bullseye with this improvement. Sure, I’ll take a chance on a fresh cup of joe.”
Standing in front of his desk, Nick was waiting for Kevin, a wide smile creasing his craggy dark features and adding a soft luster to his deep-set brown eyes. He extended his right arm and said, “So you’ve got something on your mind, old buddy. Spill it, I’m all ears.”
Each grabbed one of the two leather chairs in front of the desk, pulled them closer and waited until the pert cop placed two steaming mugs within reach on the desk. The cups actually look clean, Kevin thought.
They were about to start when Kevin’s replacement, Lieutenant Josh Gingold, popped his head in. “Good to see you again, McClosky. Just can’t stay away, can you?” he said but remained at the door. “How’s that Intelligence Unit of yours working out? Pretty good, I bet, seeing as you’re the Mayor’s favorite new toy,” Gingold half-kidded, “Just joking.”
“Lousy joke,” Kevin said, his words bouncing off Gingold’s back as he headed to his desk in the homicide bullpen.
“Okay, so what gives?” Nick queried. Like Gingold, he had heard the jabs that had been rolling around almost from the first day the Intelligence Unit took shape eight months ago.
“Shitty remarks like Gingold’s hit here,” Kevin said, tapping his right thumb on his sternum.”
“Just some jealous pissants shooting off, Christ almighty, you’re riding the Mayor’s shirttails, so just ignore it,” Nick said.
“I agree, it looks like a soft gig,” Kevin said. “But doing what? After eight months, I’m still not sure who’s ass the boss wants me to kiss.”
“And the little crew you’ve put together. I’m not the only one scratching my head over your choices.” Nick took a cautious sip of hot coffee and a deep pull on his Chesterfield. “You had a lot to choose from, but Windy Valentine and Frank Gazzi, a little crazy, wouldn’t you say?”
“You know I’m a conniving son of a bitch,” Kevin said, taking his cue from Nick with two swallows from his mug and a healthy drag from his Old Gold, a time-honored routine of two police interrogators biding time while collecting their thoughts. “You wanna listen or not?”
“I’m all ears.”
“Take our old homicide buddy, Sergeant Malcolm Valentine,” Kevin said. “His moniker, ‘Windy,’ doesn’t come close. Once he gets started with his bullshit, ‘Hurricane’ is a better fit. You should know you put up with his lip-flapping for almost a year. And he knew how to cut corners, always one step from losing his pension, just like us, but he got the job done. You looked the other way when Windy dropped signed confessions on your desk, knowing god damn well that broken noses, missing teeth, and cracked ribs were the inducements.”
“We were all rogue, still are,” Nick said. “I only want homicide cops with bleeding knuckles and broken fingers on their resumés.”
“Windy passes muster on all that and more. He’s glib, tough, mean as hell when he has to be, knows where the bodies are buried, and nobody messes with him,” Kevin said, then drained his mug and shied to the left when a slender hand passed over his right shoulder with a coffee pot and a steaming refill. “Even Gordo’s two uniformed henchmen, Gamba and Maroni, kept their hands off. On the mob’s payroll, why the hell made waves when they didn’t have to?”
“Okay, I got it with Windy, but Christ Almighty, why Frank Gazzi, the most-inept cop on the force? And to top it off, you had the Mayor squeeze the Chief for Gazzi’s sergeant stripes. Why, when everything he touched ended tragically? He even accidentally shot and killed an innocent paperboy. So stupid he even busted mob-protected whores, got his ass reamed by family friend Gordo, but kept his badge.”
“Yeah, I know all this. Come on, Nick, give me some credit,” Kevin said as he stubbed out his fag in the desk ashtray. “Gazzi is a born snooper, as quiet and as innocuous as you can get. Hell, he’s almost invisible. You know that as well as I do, or you wouldn’t have pulled him from his precinct to gumshoe into Longy and Richie the Boot’s punch-out for the Third Ward numbers dodge. He got just what we needed, and that’s why he’s working for me now, my own fly-on-the-wall.”
For the next ten minutes, Kevin unburdened the doubts he had about his job. The unit had run down several tips about suspected internal corruption, some nickel and dime briberies, candy store numbers protection, missing items from the evidence room, nothing big and hardly worth pursuing in a department notorious for its corruption. After all, boys will be boys.
Nick took special note of how Kevin tried unsuccessfully to mask his pique over the demands the Mayor insisted Kevin take care of. It involved a City Councilman who had slapped around his long-time mistress, who wanted to call it quits.
Not a word, not even a hint, would be leaked if Kevin wanted to keep his job, nothing to be put in writing. He was only to look into things, ascertain what was true or just vengeful thinking by the women, and then report back to the Mayor. Gazzi, true to his calling, affirmed everything. The Mayor got his report, barely said a word except for a curt “thank you,” and dismissed Kevin, who from that moment wondered whether keeping his lieutenant bars was worth the burn that was eating his guts out.

It was noon the same day when Deborah Hammerstein Paasche headed north along Riverside Drive, warmed by the realization that, for the first time in seven years, she was a free woman.
On West Broadway in lower Manhattan, another woman put to rest her long-held suspicion that the numbers fed to her every month had never added up. Anna Petillo Genovese reached for her desk telephone, dialed a number and waited for the tell-tale clicks that indicated a line had been cleared to the Hotel Nacional du Cuba in Havana.
“Ciao, Vito. Love and kisses from everyone,” she purred, and waited for her husband, mass murderer and mob boss Vito Genovese, to reply accordingly. She spelled everything out.

About the Author
Dedication
I have been blessed to grow up in an environment and with people who imparted their wisdom and values to me, while also affording me the opportunity to grow and learn from my own mistakes, with minimized consequences from my occasional flashes of sheer stupidity. Y'all also made me believe in myself and let me share what I observed with others.
First, my mother, Charlotte—who knew when to hide me behind her skirt and when to hold my hand in full view of my peers and my decisions. Sorry, I wasn't the daughter you'd dreamed of, but at least I was red-headed!
Next, to my father, Maurice—who set many examples for me, including some I grudgingly followed. He was a Madison Avenue advertising executive and he, even if unintendedly, taught me to sell myself and my ideas to an unsuspecting populace.
To my big-brother, Pete—who rode his bicycle in front of mine so I could learn first-hand what the American Revolutionary War meant to the people who'd created my world. Then by himself drove us both coast-to-coast and border-to-border in his Ford ""wooodie"" station wagon the summer before I started high school, so I'd have a personal view of this country I intended to have an impact on when I grew up.
To my little-brother, David—even though he grew up to be taller than me. He taught me to care about those who relied on me to help keep them safe, and since he'd follow my example, maybe I should be more thoughtful about what I showed him.
To my big sisters, Pat and Barb—who lived across the street in our grass-lined, oak-tree shaded, quiet little suburban New Jersey neighborhood. You were older and wiser, and we never fought. You just taught me to believe in myself, and for the love of God remember you create your own reputation! And we always knew we were ""family"" even when most folks didn't realize it. The street between our houses was really just a paved hallway! Your parents were always there for me too, in emergencies and for inspiration!
To my ""best-friend-forever"", Jesse—who came somedays in the afternoon to help Mom keep our house clean and liveable despite the ability of three boys to hide his efforts. He taught me a lesson I never forgot and I love him to this day for it. God decided that he would always have a nice tan, even if he never went down to the ""Jersey shore"", just like I'd always be red-haired until I got old enough for it to turn directly to white. (Never grey).
To my beloved daughters, Janice and Amber, who blessed me in their chldhood and believed enough in the stories I hadn't had time enough to tell yet, to guarantee that this ""story"" and those to follow, make their way into print, into your hands and, hopefully into your heart and mind.
To the depth of my heart and soul, my loved and adored wife, Shandae, who tolerates my ability to ""disappear in plain sight"" behind a keyboard despite her need for ""just a few minutes of your time and assistance"".
More, to Robert Dugoni and Lisa Scottoline, both NYTimes best-selling authors in their own rights, who cared enough to mentor me ""to become a bookshelf competitor"" because writing is a gift best-shared. I can never thank them enough for their kindness and support, for all the years.
A bit of ""thanks"" and an ""inside joke"" to Michael Connelly, brilliant author of ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" series of novels for his ""gift"" to me of ""all his right, title and interest"" in the title ""The Bentley Barrister"". I hope I enhanced your legacy!
Last, but far from least, a tip of the cap and ""Thanks"" to Barbara Peters and the two ""Patricks"" at The Poisoned Pen"" bookstore in Scottsdale, AZ, my literary home for at least the past generation.
Chapter 1
The day before the second Sunday of February, known as Super Bowl Sunday. In the host city at 10:22 a.m.
Rudy heard the “whoosh” of the stopping elevator and raced from the hospital's emergency waiting room to meet it. Before its door had even fully opened, he'd already reached inside to grab at the black jacket of his dear friend, a priest. The same friend he'd telephoned in a panic late last night.
“Thank God you could finally get here, Padre. They're still not sure if either of them will survive, but both babies were killed instantly. She's hurt terribly but stabilized somewhat since she miscarried. CAT's hurt really bad too. Plans are to operate on him again as soon as they can get their super surgeon, an orthopedic digital specialist, here through that madness and crowds. “The media vultures broadcasting this massive tragedy are flippantly calling this, ‘The Hospital Super Bowl' - live, coming to you via satellite from the hospital's parking lot.'”
Monsignor Antonio Rizzo's priestly instincts stepped into play as he put his arms around this obviously emotional and agitated man while his memory skipped back a generation to flash on Rudy and CAT, his “Alias Twins,” from their Notre Dame years. He'd often chuckled inwardly that he might be the only man in a large room to know the birth names of both his celebrity lads. Daniel, whom he was holding in his arms, became Rudy nationwide when the movie about his Notre Dame football “career” became a huge “must see” national film event. Simply titled “Rudy,” that nickname overtook his true name in the public's memory.
They also talked about the “other twin” from at least half a generation later. Then Collum Arbuthnot Taylor had been the media-dubbed CAT even before going to Notre Dame to dominate college football. Simply his initials back then had filled any available space in printed football coverage, including the back pages of the local sports section in his high school years.
“Danny lad, take a deep breath, then tell me the status of things.”
Rudy/Danny didn't have time to even breathe; he had too much to explain. “Please, Padre, come talk to the surgeon with me. He's washing up now. And please ask God for His help! I didn't know what else to do when I called you. I can't believe any of this is even real. But I know that if I can't wake up from it, this damn sure must be more than simply a horrible nightmare.”
The priest put his arms around his long-time friend, trying both to calm him and to better understand what all he was trying to explain to him. As a priest, he'd been called out many times to hospitals under emergency conditions. This morning, he'd even been flown over a thousand miles in a private jet, simply just to get him here. Then it seemed to take that long again to even get from the airport, past the huge media crowd outside this hospital, and inside here. The media crush had been brutal. Everyone trying to capture the intense and overwhelming public interest regarding their public friend, CAT. Before all this, he'd been listed as tomorrow's Super Bowl starting quarterback. At the moment though, all this chaos at the hospital was being broadcast live and in gory detail nationwide. Still, everyone had lots of questions, though no answers!
The priest in him was now trying to calm this man frantically clutching at him, who was both a long-time friend and, like their mutual friend CAT, a media-created celebrity. Rudy often joked that CAT had at least became famous with his own initials, while Rudy became famous merely with a nickname, the one-word title of a once very popular movie. But both men had, of course, naturally been products of the monsignor's legendary Notre Dame University!
Monsignor's true challenge? The priest in him was struggling to accept a harsh reality. Collum, that now grown-up little boy of his memory, might well be dying right here and right now. He'd raised that orphaned boy since early childhood, way back in his days as headmaster at the residential school/orphanage of Saint Francis of Assisi in Highland Hills.
Now well over a quarter century later, that same little boy, all grown-up and hugely famous now, had been a Heisman Trophy winner and now was arguably the best quarterback playing pro football or, as many people argued, who ever played it.
But at the moment, Collum, that boy of his memory, was suddenly the tragic focus of this overwhelming media attention. One thing was painfully clear—even if his boy survived this ugly car crash, he certainly would not be tomorrow's starting quarterback at the Super Bowl. But big-time tragedy equaled big-time news, hence the crush of media attention.
Still, despite having been questioned by this same massive media crowd as he'd struggled earlier just to get through them and inside this hospital, he'd learned almost nothing about what had happened to his boy. The frenzy was all being live-broadcast nationwide and via satellite. Tomorrow's huge schedule of football events were all on pause as the media's attention was totally focused on Collum Arbuthnot Taylor, a future Hall of Fame quarterback, known since his teenage years in the media and by the public simply by his initials, CAT. That same guy who now would not be starting tomorrow's Super Bowl as had been expected even if he survived whatever happened here.
The monsignor tried to grasp the situation regarding CAT and his family. He'd also focused on his own wartime memories, the bombings from his own long-ago childhood in Italy plus several other world wars during his long priestly life.
It all reminded him of the many times before, in hospitals and makeshift emergency rooms, when he'd been called upon to administer his Church's “last rites.” Which is why, this morning, leaving his rectory, he'd specifically thought that today, such a need would be so intensely personal! He'd reflexively patted his jacket pocket to check on the way out the door, then prayed deeply that he wouldn't need what was there to perform his priestly duties today.
This now grown-up man, Collum, whom he'd refused to ever call CAT, was as close to being his own child as a priest could righteously experience. He'd also officiated at Collum's marriage to Kitten, then baptized and was expecting soon to confirm their daughter, Angelica, and to baptize their soon-to-be-born child, a boy, they already knew. All of them might well be dead by this day's end! Dear God, please no! A quiet plea from his soul!
“Daniel lad, when you called to tell me that our boy had been in a bad car crash, I never imagined anything on this scale. Can you bring me up to date? What all has happened here?”
“Well, Padre, I'm told CAT had taken Kitten and Angelica to visit her parents' home for dinner last evening. Like so many stereotypical New Yorkers, after retiring, her parents were preparing to soon move South to a quiet retirement community in Florida. After dinner, they'd walked CAT and Kitten out to their big rental car and said their good nights as CAT prepared to head back into the city toward the team's hotel. CAT securely belted Angelica into her child safety seat in the rear of the car. He'd also checked that Kitten was securely belted in next to him up front as they waved ‘good night' and headed back into ‘The City' via the Interstate.
“Barely a mile from the in-laws' home, as CAT headed down the Interstate on-ramp, a stolen truck, speeding in the dark with no lights, tried to get off the highway driving up that same on-ramp CAT was driving down to enter the highway. The truck essentially ran over the car CAT was driving. A pursuing police car with flashing red lights and siren barely managed to stop without hitting the mass of crushed metal debris strewn all over that highway ramp. He found CAT inside the car, bleeding badly from his own injuries but frantically tearing at the crushed metal debris inside the car as he tried to free Kitten from her safety belt and the debris on top of her. Angelica, in her child safety seat behind them, had been crushed under the truck's wheel and already was clearly dead. Kitten was unconscious and bleeding profusely from her injuries, but she was also in the process of miscarrying their unborn son. She was, and remains now, unconscious with massive head, neck and shoulder trauma. The policeman radioed for help, but the damage had already been done.
“CAT is now unable to control his left arm and shoulder because they were so badly crushed in the crash. Still, he was shredding his right hand just trying to rip away the mangled metal pinning Kitten inside the car and against the door next to her seat. That was last night. Nothing's gotten any better since then.
“Bottom line? CAT's beloved five-year-old daughter, Angelica, is dead. Their unborn son is dead. Kitten is almost dead, though she may survive despite the massive trauma and damage to her head, her chest, and shoulder. CAT had to be heavily sedated simply to get him away from that scene and bring him here to the hospital.
“She's had major surgery and is heavily sedated. CAT's already had surgery on his left shoulder and the left side of his chest. They're preparing now to take him back in for more surgery, but I don't know what more they're trying to salvage. He was unconscious before he could even be delivered to the hospital. The surgeon told me earlier that even if CAT survives all this, he'll be fortunate if he ever again has any meaningful use at all of what remains of his chewed-up hands. Or even his upper left side and shoulder, much of it simply crushed beyond repair. And I have no idea what this surgery they're getting ready to perform on him now is even for, but they've had to wait hours for this super orthopedic digital surgical specialist to even get here to do what he can. As the national media keeps reporting, CAT will not be tomorrow's starting Super Bowl quarterback. Their news! CAT will never play football again, or even, as I've been told, is he ever likely to be able to even reach up high enough to comb his own hair!”
The Monsignor felt his own shoulders slump as tears ran involuntarily down his cheeks.
Chapter 2
It's the next day, Super Bowl Sunday, at the stadium. It is early afternoon here, and it is now game time.
The overflow stadium crowd is hyper-excited, but there's also an uncommon, yet clearly observable sense of subdued and scattered emotion running thoughout this crowd
Suddenly, there is a meaningful, yet quiet flurry of activity at both ends of the stadium as the TV cameras pick up clusters of players in uniforms entering the playing field from each team. They are subdued, as they slowly come out onto the field. No one runs. They have all walked out, quietly, onto the playing field, and all together. Now, they all simply stand silently with their teammates, each team at it's opposite end of the stadium, all walking, and pausing, quietly. They are also subdued, not at all game-day hyper-emotional.
There is one totally uncommon and unexpected similarity about both teams, including their respective coaching staffs. Everybody on the field is wearing a two-inch-wide black armband around their right bicep. Nobody runs. Nobody yells. A hush settles over the entire stadium, matching their silence on the field. Quietly, players and coaches all stand, facing each other from opposite ends of the field, as the sound of a solitary bugle is heard playing “Taps.”
As the TV cameras pan the players, many are clearly, openly and unashamedly tearful. Shoulders can be seen to tremble as they stand. CAT Taylor is their elected representative to the Office of the Commissioner, and he is nowhere on this field, and they know both the how and the why not. Even with everyone now on the field, this crowd remains still and quiet. As the last notes of the bugle fade to silence, the stadium announcer quietly asks of the crowd: “Please stand for the National Anthem.” They do so, respectfully and quietly, as that same bugle plays again. Following the anthem, the same voice again calmly calls out from the stadium's speakers, dignifiedly inviting all here to “Let's Play Ball.”
Now, a roar reverberates from all those present, as the scoreboard displays a full-screen giant photo - simply of just the back and shoulders of a football jersey with “TAYLOR” across its back shoulders and below that, CAT's number, “9.” It's game time!
Chapter 3
Years later, just another morning with no definite date, CAT stands in the fresh air of his rooftop garden, reflecting.
CAT simply never learned the art of relaxing. Many who knew him even described him as driven, including off the playing field. Despite being already wealthy, on paper at least, before he'd even played in his first professional football game, (one reality of being drafted as the league's First-Round, First-Pick). Still, he never really outgrew being “that poor little orphan kid,” at least in his head. Still, he'd become adept, early on, at finding a variety of imaginative ways to “earn a buck,” many at least arguably legal! And he could look as innocent as a nativity figure, as “Padre” told people. CAT would predictably laugh at that description and add, “Yeah, the lamb!” But still, he'd grown up in a Catholic orphanage, at least mostly and sort of.
Predictably, even many years later, his intense inner drive created a push to attend law school during the spring and summer months between seasons of his early pro football career. Not to chase a someday professional future. He simply needed a challenge beyond football. That was his constant—to always drive himself beyond his history. Always, a need to excel. Along the way, somehow it became his personal goal to become the players' union representative to the Commissioner's Office. Predictably, without a second thought, he'd simply gone to law school, of course back at Notre Dame. There, for the very first time, he'd met Rudy, already a major celebrity and motivational specialist and speaker. They had a significant impact on each other since that first meeting.
CAT had also been unofficially mentored in his final year of law school by Highland Hills County's Assistant Prosecutor, an excellent courtroom lawyer, named Sterling Best. Mr. Best had graciously volunteered his time and energy to show CAT the intricacies of criminal law and courtrooms while he was still in law school. CAT took and passed his bar exam well before his pro football career instantly ended. By then, he'd already been planning to practice law after football right here in Highland Hills, this very same small city where he grew up.
Not much before CAT's football career suddenly ended, Mr. Best, whom CAT had nicknamed Silver, suffered a massive stroke. His permanent physical and mental limitations suddenly ended his courtroom career, and he'd been terminated by the County Prosecutor's office “to cut costs,” so Mr. Best was then living very modestly on a disability pension, more illusion than reality, bordering on poverty. While CAT certainly had his own challenges, he never forgot his own past or the kindness of others to him. He also knew Sterling could likely never return to the courtrooms. But he also knew that man knew a hell of a lot about courtrooms and criminal law. Meaning he could create an “in-office lawyer's presence” even when CAT was “off-and-running” to wide-spread courtrooms. So, CAT had suggested creating a law office partnership with him, simultaneously increasing both Sterling's income and CAT's courtroom effectiveness in a criminal defense practice well beyond that of a sole practitioner. Welcome to Best & Taylor Law! Conveniently located directly across Court Street from the Highland Hills County Courthouse.
Through the years, reflecting back on his early childhood, CAT had struggled, either trying to forget or to remember passages of his own history. He'd been only modestly successful at either. Forget? He sort of tried to forget seeing his father, in a rage, murder his mother, then his brother. But mostly he focused on remembering the day his Momma's dear friend, Bubbe, took him to this very same courthouse, just to see ‘that man' get what he deserved - life in prison. He'd died there, appropriately enough in a fight. Score one for Justice! Collum had learned about justice - early on. Ever after, and still, he pursues it - often and skillfully.
But that forever memorable day had a secondary significance to it. Collum, too young for public school or to yet be dubbed CAT by the lazy sports media, had been watching when that man got sentenced. Afterward, he'd stood outside on the high plaza outside of this very same courthouse, looking at the far horizon and his own future. His eyes had been captured by the view directly across Court Street.
There it stood, forever memorable to him. A towering and well-aged Victorian mansion. No doubt once an architectural masterpiece, it had become a vacant historic derelict on a plot of ground neither commercially nor residentially useful. Yet it still stood proud in CAT's view as he decided, then and there: “Someday I'm gonna own number 6 Court Street.”
Later, football having made him wealthy, he actually bought that derelict mansion. Why? Truthfully? Simply because he could! He'd explain to others that while it was a derelict, it had “great bones.” But, the inner truth? He'd already decided to someday turn this “sort of ‘Victorian-era' residence” into his law office across the street from the courthouse. In the process of its renovation, many years later, he'd learned its address was not number 6 after all. His office was actually number 9 Court Street.
Apparently, once upon a time, when that front door's numeral 9 had been properly in place on the entry door, it was held by two mounting screws! Somewhere along history's pathway, the screw holding the top of the large brass number to the front door had vanished. This allowed the door's number to sort of swing down, held in place now only by its single loose bottom screw. That had turned the door's number upside down. Years later, during its renovation, turning that number 6 right side up again and properly reinstalling that top second screw, CAT had suddenly realized he was actually the proud owner of 9 Court Street. He'd now known why God had persuaded him long, long ago to wear the number 9 on the back of his football jersey!
So number 9 had always been his uniform number. He now learned it was also meant to be his law office address. Years later, after the destruction of his family, it even became his residence address. His badly injured wife needed to be placed in a long-term, assisted-living facility so he learned to live alone and to visit with her every Sunday.
After “the crash,” he'd tried to live in the large, spectacular house he and Kitten built to be their “family home.” But, whenever he tried to sleep in that house, he'd been “visited” by too many ghosts and overwhelming memories. He'd finally been persuaded to donate that residence to Kitten's favorite charity, called Haven House. It became a place of salvation, social rehabilitation, and promise to others in need of it. His legal assistant / office manager, LaKisha, had been a product of Kitten's kindness and rehabilitation, as a graduate of that charity. CAT hired her, and later nicknamed her “Google” because she always had or was able to find for him the answer to every question he ever needed to have answered.
Google also managed Kitten's charity, having herself been saved long ago by its presence in her shattered young life. He'd also later expanded the law office by building a multistoried, high-towered working environment behind the signature Victorian entry from Court Street. He'd included several stories below grade for vehicle parking plus residences for his two (full-time) drivers since he could not even force himself to drive any automobile after his awful crash. He'd also included three additional stories to the top of the new office's tower space, which became both his residence and his sanctuary from the full-time demands of his law practice. And every day he savored his four-minute commute to work, always arriving at his office with a smile on his face!
Also every Sunday, after attending service at Padre Tony's St. Francis of Assisi Church, he was driven north up into the breathtakingly beautiful wooded mountains to Sanctuary, where Kitten was cared for and administered to. CAT, in the privacy of himself, had grudgingly accepted the professional evaluation that his Kitten would never realistically be able to leave the caring facility of Morning's Sanctuary. He also accepted that he would visit with her there every Sunday regardless, which was also why he purchased his own jet plane, learned to fly it, then hired two experienced pilots to create a private rental company for scheduled rentals when he didn't need to be airlifted anywhere very far away. He didn't personally fly often, just often enough to keep his license active. And even then he always flew with one of his highly experienced charter pilots.
As CAT had described it to others, it's not the lifestyle he'd planned, just the lifestyle he'd accepted and learned to adapt to with a positive motivation.
Chapter 4
Years later, and in the present day, on a Thursday, December 10, 1:10 p.m., at the law office of Best & Taylor
Othello had raced directly from class over to CAT Taylor's law office, following his last morning law class. He knew CAT might already be in court, not in his office, but maybe he could get Google to at least give him an update regarding this morning's events. As her nickname implied, she really did know everything happening in her realm. She also had the answer to any question regarding this office. He sat across from her desk impressed, as always, with her command of both her office and the courtrooms, where her boss typically dominated things.
Today, she was on top of her things and gave him her undivided attention as she brought him up to date. “For starters, after the prosecutor rested his case, they sent the jury home for the weekend at midmorning. Next, here's a stunning piece of news: CAT and that judge got into a verbal pissing contest, but it was privately in chambers and off the record. Fortunately, there had been neither court reporters nor TV cameras present there in chamber.
“Let me revise what I just said. CAT assured me they were not arguing. He and judge were just “discussing issues” in hopes of resolving their differences. Ever heard that maxim about ‘hope springs eternal'? They're going back after the lunch break to make their official record, in the presence of the court's reporter, of that earlier “informal proceedings.” Of course, also in the TV camera's presence since it will then be in open court!
“Othello, I'd suggest you head straight over there now. Your favorite trial lawyer is chomping at the bit to state his position clearly and as a matter of public record. But first, a word of caution to you. If CAT swears at that asshole judge, you will not laugh! CAT has promised me that he won't swear at him today, at least in public. But with no jury present, there are limits to even CAT's control of things.”
Grinning broadly, the nicely dressed young law student still managed to look serious. “What's the issue between them? There has to be something long-standing.”
“Straightforward answer? I think they've hated each other since before either of them was toilet-trained! They've been fighting on the playgrounds of this city since they were toddlers. Both were All-State high school football players. Hand for the defense, CAT for the offense. Hand went to Highland Hills County's North Valley High School (public), and CAT went to St. Francis of Assisi High (parochial). So they never played football against each other in any game with referees back then. After high school, Hand went to Grambling, and CAT went to Notre Dame, both on athletic scholarships. Those colleges never played against each other, at least in their years there.
CAT won the Heisman Trophy, Hand didn't. CAT was awarded a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford; Hand wasn't. Hand went directly into the NFL and blew out a knee with a career-ending injury in his first season while CAT was still in England at Oxford. After that, CAT came home to play in the NFL as the number one selection and had a Hall of Fame career despite it being shortened by an incredibly ugly car crash he'll never recover from. Back awhile, he'd invited Hand, as his guest, to attend his induction into the “Hall,” but Hand neither attended nor even acknowledged CAT's kind invitation.
“They'd managed to avoid appearing at the same time in the same courtroom for a lot of years, but even good things must come to an end sometimes. At least they haven't succumbed to open warfare yet. Keep your fingers crossed. One word of warning to you though. If they start cursing at each other in open court, don't you dare even smile! There will be live cameras there, remember!”
Othello bowed theatrically. “Your wish is my command, m'lady! But I have one curiosity question I've been meaning to ask you. I think I understand why he's nicknamed you Google, and I agree, but why am I nicknamed Othello?”
“Questions for you, young man. But you don't have to answer out loud since I'm in a kind mood. Is your last name really Bard?”
He nodded.
“Next, since your undergrad degree was in English literature, can I presume you are at least somewhat familiar with these two facts? Fact one, a sort of famous English writer dude named Billy Shakespeare was often nicknamed ‘The Bard of Avon'. Fact Two, in one of his most famous writings, we find perhaps Shakespeare's most memorable character, ‘Othello', a black dude and in an English novel, no less. She smiled as she asked him, “Any other questions?”
He simply slowly shook his head and looked stunned!
“Be aware of one other reality, young man. CAT Taylor “knows” that you and me both are ‘black people'. Anyone who calls us that in our presence runs the risk of CAT bitch-slapping them across the mouth as he advises them to keep their irrelevant chatter to themselves in his presence. I've seen him do it!”
Othello tried not to display the embarrassment he felt. Good training for a future courtroom lawyer! But now it was time for him to race to the courthouse before his seat at counsel table with CAT could get preempted by someone paying better attention!
As he crossed Court Street, heading for Hand's courtroom, he analyzed his view of the situation. The jury box would be silent and empty now. Judge and the lawyers would struggle to agree on the legal instructions the jury should be given when they returned on Monday.
But testimony from all prosecution witnesses had ended, and the State has rested its case. So now their jury would need to be instructed on the law that applied to any defense witness's testimony, including anything from the defendant himself, should he choose to take the stand. Sounds simple, he thought. Until he remembered CAT's First Rule of Jury Trials. Namely, “Be wary of anything involving a jury that seems simple.” Twelve strangers, each trying to convince the other eleven that they know what they're doing here. Bad karma!
The status quo would inevitably find disaster wherever it was hiding. More significantly? You'd never see it coming!
Chapter 5
Same day, at 1:30 p.m. in a courtroom at the Highland Hills County Courthouse
Othello tried to slip unobtrusively into his seat at CAT's defense counsel table without interrupting his mentor's focus and attention just as a hush began to settle over the overflow crowd in this historic courtroom. He looked up beyond their table to see a large black man in a long judicial robe entering from that far back judicial door to walk boldly toward them, then sit at the high and dominating judge's bench. A big, prominent nameplate there identified him as JUDGE CEDRIC B. HAND. Settling himself, he hammers his judicial gavel, while loudly demanding that all in his courtroom, “Be seated!”
There's a brief rustle of movement before quiet again overtook the room. Then the crowd's attention instantly shifts to follow a red-haired white man as he stood tall and collected before stepping away from the defense counsel's table. Clearly a lawyer, in an elegantly tailored three-piece suit, he winked at Othello as he stood, clearly with pride. Striding calmly and purposefully, he stopped behind the speaker's podium in the center of this large courtroom. Clearly, the man did not need a gavel to totally capture the immediate attention of this vibrant public crowd, nor did he need a nameplate to identify himself!
He is Collum Arbuthnot Taylor, long a very public national figure, instantly recognizable. High profile and formerly a big-time pro football quarterback. Retired from football now, yet he remains a media figure, only now it's as a criminal defense lawyer. He still is usually identified by the media, and still annoying to him even a generation later, simply by his initials, CAT. He certainly had no need for a nameplate to identify himself, though he teased that he used to at least have his full last name across the shoulders of his uniform when he was a player!
Though not a common thing in Judge Hand's courtroom, it was not at all uncommon for CAT to be followed, even now, everywhere he moved, even including in a courtroom, by the focused attention of the blinking red eye of a live TV news camera. Today, by earlier order of the county's Presiding Judge, a single news-pool camera is being permitted in this courtroom. It will follow the proceedings, watching and sharing it all, including CAT wherever he went in the courtroom, plus whatever happened here. The national live TV audience assuredly wouldn't miss a thing! The reality? This was already CAT's courtroom despite the presumptive insistence of Judge Hand's oversized nameplate to the contrary!
Virtually unnoticed though he sat there in plain sight, another man remained at the table CAT had just vacated. This very white man was noticeably older than Othello. Clearly, to even a casual observer, this older man had not been outside in the sunlight in a very long time. Earlier today, before breaking for lunch, their trial jurors had been excused for the rest of today, and for all of Friday, the court's law and motions day where they wouldn't be needed. They were instructed instead to return Monday morning when this trial would resume for them.
Now with the jury no longer present to observe things, this older man had no longer been dressed out in the suit he had been wearing in the courtroom. As per jail protocol, with no jury present, he did not need to be “civi-dressed.” He simply wore an institutional jail uniform, simple, black-and-white, with horizontal-stripes. No lettering needed to proclaim ‘INMATE'. That status was actually boldly clear anyway, courtesy of the two uniformed deputies standing near him, their backs against the courtroom's side wall, each with a hand comfortably resting on the butt of a holstered pistol at their belt. Clearly, any juror who hadn't already gotten the unspoken message that their defendant was being held in custody would assuredly be the same one's “forgetting” the judge's admonition not to watch any televised portions of this trial. Oh well!
The jury box was silent and empty now as Judge Hand and the lawyers struggled to agree on the legal instructions these same jurors (Half-watching from home? Despite being instructed not to watch TV coverage?) should be given when they returned on Monday. Testimony from all the prosecution's witnesses had now ended. Therefore, the jury should be instructed regarding the law, which applied to any defense witness's testimony, including from the defendant himself, should he choose to testify.
Othello, that other man at that table now, was much younger and brown complexioned, somewhere in skin tone between the black judge and the white lawyer. He was CAT's courtroom clerk and a current law school student, and he was dressed quite nicely in a suit. He seriously hoped he's at least beginning to look like a lawyer by now, his third year of law school. He's also overwhelmingly excited just to be in an actual courtroom with his mentor in front of a live jury during a real murder trial. It had been his dream since childhood to become a trial lawyer when he grew up.
Especially now, since he knew things would be far more intense than they'd been. He knew CAT must directly confront this judge, and he'd have to do it all live, in public view. The jury had been instructed not to watch TV coverage of the trial. Nobody could seriously believe they wouldn't.
Judge Hand had clearly indicated in the informal discussion earlier today in his inner chambers, without even the court reporter present, his intention to refuse CAT's request for several jury instructions regarding the law this jury should be instructed to apply in deciding this case. Now CAT could fully and formally challenge Hand, live here in open court, and on the record so an appeal court could review the court reporter's transcribed record for errors made by this judge regarding any failure to give CAT's requested instructions, oral and written, should his client be convicted. He also recalled what Google told him.
“You'll seldom hear CAT swear out loud unless he's in Hand's court. Maybe joking around here in the office on occasion. But in Hand's court? It's simply hard to ever miss it. He tries not to lose his cool or swear there. He's assured me of that, often in fact. But Hand just seems to bring an aggressive element into their interactions. They've been fighting each other since they were both grammar schoolkids in this very same city.
“CAT has assured me he's written out everything he intends to say today in court. Now if he'll just stick to his script. But only time will tell that, I guess. If nothing's really changed, you absolutely need to remember one thing, Othello. Don't you dare to even smile if your boss swears again in that man's courtroom!” Of course, she'd been smiling when she'd told him that. Othello even caught himself trying to deep-breathe and smile at the same time! Courtroom tension was a new reality for him! But he was learning—and definitely learning from the very best! He already felt the pull of the courtroom.
The jury box was silent and empty now. Judge and the lawyers were struggling to agree on the legal instructions the jury should be given on Monday when they returned. Testimony from all prosecution witnesses had ended. So now the jury needed to be instructed on the law that applied to any defense witness's testimony, including from the defendant himself, should he choose to testify.
The courtroom crowd was sitting, eerily quiet now, intently watching the tall lawyer as he stood statue-still facing this judge. Once a legendary athlete, Collum Arbuthnot Taylor became CAT long ago in his teenage years, whether he liked it or not. The sports writers chose to avoid writing out the full Scottish names his mother had given him from her heritage. They somehow always seemed to forget how to spell and pronounce them. So he's just CAT now and had been since before he could legally drive a car!
Way back when, during offseasons of his high-profile professional football career, CAT had completed law school before becoming a major criminal defense trial lawyer in courtrooms all across the country since football ended. Perhaps that explained, in part at least, this overflow courtroom crowd. They got to watch their guy play and didn't even need to buy a ticket. Also, CAT's trials frequently involved murder and other crimes of high emotion, hence both the courtroom crowd and huge supervision by a big live national TV viewing audience.
While it was generally accepted that no murder trial was really ever orderly or routine, considering the high level of emotions involved, there had never been even a slight chance this trial would become an exception to that reality. CAT knew, well before it began, this trial in front of this judge and in this courthouse would absolutely and predictably become a worst-case disaster. He'd also known there was little he could do to change that reality as it would unfold.
CAT and this judge both studied law, though at different times and at different law schools and for different reasons. Eventually, both became lawyers in this very same city where they'd each grown up and battled. One was later elected to multiple terms as a local trial court judge. The other was elected to football's Hall of Fame in Akron before becoming a nationally prominent, high-profile criminal defense trial lawyer. Neither man ever voted for the other, and each struggled, even all these years later, to even be civil to the other.
Their battle of wills began in this same city when they were both in grammar school within walking distance of where they're still fighting with each other. Some things simply never changed.
So far they've survived the presentation of the prosecution's case against the defendant. Now during this hearing and with their jury absent, all parties were trying to make a record of their respective views regarding any legal issues to be resolved before the presentation of testimony from any defense witnesses, perhaps to even include the defendant himself. Once their respective positions regarding the legal issues involved here had been made part of the official record in this case, the trial would be able to resume first thing Monday morning. Fridays were always the court's scheduled law and motions day and were never a jury day.
Close to finishing for the day, Othello has just suddenly grasped something rather significant. Hand's name might boldly appear on that big, brazen nameplate on the front of this courtroom's judicial bench, but CAT clearly already owned this courtroom. But then CAT tended to dominate any space he occupied!
Othello also smiled to himself as he recalled Judge's earlier demand of this live crowd: “Be seated!”
Judge really should have been more responsible, he thought, and warned them, “Hold onto your seats!”
Chapter 6
Moments later, still in the courtroom
CAT now stood behind the podium, a solitary figure, no longer smiling, and prepared to formally respond here to the judge's unreported and informal rulings made earlier during a meeting with the lawyers in his private chambers. It wasn't even that Hand had told them he was particularly ruling in favor of any request from the prosecutor. It's just a reality that he'd simply rule against anything he could for which CAT advocated. In reality, nothing's new there either.
“With all due respect, Your Honor, to provide a complete record of our earlier unrecorded conference in chambers, the law you're proposing to instruct this jury to apply in deciding this case is simply erroneous. Even you must realize that. It's all simply pure and total bullshit.”
With CAT's voice still resonating throughout the courtroom, Judge Hand leaped to his feet behind his high judicial bench, his index finger aiming down like a weapon, at “that, that…lawyer!”
Hand's voice thundered in response to CAT's challenge. “Taylor, how dare you use that language in my courtroom?”
Seriously? A question from Hand for CAT to answer? Doubtful!
A veiled demand for an apology or an explanation? Either might be more likely. But neither was significantly any less realistic!
CAT's response to Hand? “Well, at least for a change, Your Honor, you're not totally ignoring what I've said. I guess that's a major step forward toward justice! However, on this issue, my voice and vocabulary clearly speak the truth! And now it's all on the record.”
Suddenly, the courtroom crowd had become fully involved instantly and clearly. They were no longer simply spectators. They're beginning to realize a stark reality—they all just became instant witnesses to the lead story on tonight's news! Nationwide! And live!
Ever a model of calm professionalism and control, CAT now simply stood tall as he slowly and very deliberately shook his head from side to side. The quiet courtroom's atmosphere had become instantly electric. The crowded gallery stirred, their rumbling whispers growing louder and, very clearly now, mixing in with a scattering of giggles!
Openly challenged and clearly hostile, Judge Hand stood behind his judicial bench, his teeth clenched as he slowly and deliberately articulated each separate syllable of his response to CAT. “One more insolent word out of that mouth of yours, Taylor, and I will hold you in contempt and fine you for every single word you speak. Do I make myself perfectly clear, Counselor?”
“Rarely, Your Honor!” observably annoyed, CAT answered him loudly and with a straight face! But the live national TV's courtroom camera still caught the shadow of his smile. Still, the sarcasm in CAT's response appeared to have clearly soared straight over the judge's head since he neither reacted nor responded to it. But as CAT intended, Hand couldn't simply ignore it now either!
In addition to the live national TV coverage, this courtroom's gallery was crowded, filled to overflowing! Once and still really a legendary public persona, CAT's mere presence anywhere predictably drew a crowd, especially in a courtroom where the public didn't even need a ticket to watch him take command and control the action!
His voice as calm as ever, CAT remained a dominating figure simply standing with his own extended index finger aiming straight back at this challenging judge. “Seriously, Your Honor? Since day one, you've ignored the law, choosing to make this your racial trial. Now you're presuming to dictate my vocabulary and word choices? You can't seriously be thinking about even trying to do that!”
As ever, CAT stood calmly, a model of professionalism and control, slowly shaking his head from side to side. With his blunt response, CAT has suddenly turned this quiet courtroom's atmosphere electric. The crowded gallery stirred, their rumbling whispers boldly growing louder to mix with a scattering of giggles! Clearly, this was now CAT's courtroom, no longer Hand's.
Openly and clearly hostile, Judge Hand stood behind his judicial bench, teeth clenched as he slowly and very deliberately articulated each separate syllable of his response. “One more insolent word out of that mouth of yours, Taylor, and I will hold you in contempt and fine you for every single word you speak. Do I make myself perfectly clear, Counselor?”
“Rarely!” Observably annoyed himself now, CAT answers Hand, loudly, with a straight face and a clear challenge! The TV camera had caught the shadow of his smile, highlighted by the curl of his lips. Somehow, CAT's sarcastic and challenging response appeared to have soared, at least figuratively, straight over the judge's head since he neither reacted nor responded.
CAT's flash of annoyance appeared to cool as he casually and very deliberately pulled a money clip from his trouser pocket. Theatrically moistening just a single fingertip with the tip of his tongue, he calmly began to count out dollar bills from his clip all while nonchalantly strolling up toward the judicial bench. Courtesy of his athletic height and physical skills, CAT was able to toss the paper money all the way up onto the judge's bench. “There ya go! That oughta cover my tab with you, at least for the moment.”
Clearly unsettled now and realizing the full courtroom plus a live national TV audience was watching him, Judge Hand hesitated. “Mr. Taylor, you're entitled to a hearing before I can hold you in contempt and fine you. Don't you realize that?”
Already strolling away from the judge and with his back to him, CAT responded to Hand while facing away from him and over his shoulder. All clearly for the benefit of the eager video media. Raising just a single eyebrow, he answered simply, “Sure, I know that. But, Judge, what would be the point of a hearing? I mean, I'm an honorable man. So I'd have to admit it to anyone asking me. I do absolutely and personally have significant contempt for you. And with very good reason!”
“Damn it, Taylor, we ain't done with this yet,” His Honor sputtered. “Not another word from you! My word counter is running, mister. Every word comin' outta that mouth of yours is gonna cost you! Now you got any question about what I just told you?”
CAT's sarcasm was clear and unmistakable as he stood tall, staring back at that man in his black robe. “Actually, Judge, I do! But it's just a single question, and it's just a little one. Really nothing you need to bother yourself about at this moment.”
Attempting to display controlled sarcasm himself, the judge snidely asked, “What, pray tell, is not clear to you, counselor? I need to know now! I want this settled now. So I want you to tell me! Do it! Ask your question and do it right now!”
Peering pensively into his right hand, the one still holding his money clip, CAT responded to that demand but slowly, “W-e-l-l. Just so I can manage things and budget my limited available finances to continue our conversation, I'm wondering whether you'll consider asshole to be one word or two words when you're counting my words?”
His Honor's eyes clearly widened as he sputtered, “That insolence is gonna cost you, mister!”
CAT slowly turned back to stand, his hands on his hips, as he stared at the judge. “Excuse me, sir. You rather pointedly and very clearly demanded that I tell you my one little question and to do it, quoting you, ‘right now.' I clearly couldn't simply ignore such a direct judicial demand now, could I? That would be totally rude! Seriously, Judge, I was simply trying to comply with your uncharacteristically clear, personal, and unconditional judicial demand.”
Now obviously, undeniably and openly disrespected, and publicly humbled while also intensely aware of that damn TV camera still staring silently at him with its blinking little red eye, the judge attempted to somehow regain control of things. All despite the clear, obvious, and unmistakable sound of serious giggles beginning to mix with the whispers in the gallery. “I demand an immediate apology, Taylor, or you'll be spending your night in my jail for contempt!”
CAT simply stared at him, shrugging his shoulders as he resumed his stroll slowly and casually away from the man. Clearly heading back toward the defense table now, head shaking slowly from side to side, CAT responded over his shoulder, “Judge, even you must know none of that can happen without a hearing. And you certainly can't be both a judge and a witness at such a hearing.” He stopped and turned to stare defiantly. His challenge silent and obvious.
CAT owned this crowd clearly. Reality had finally convinced Judge Hand of that truism. Opting for retreat with at least a semblance of dignity, he stormed off the bench in silence but with fire in his eyes. Disappearing through the rear doorway, he shouted out behind himself, “We're in recess until Monday morning at ten thirty sharp. And, Taylor, if you're even half as smart as you seem to think you are, you'll bring your damn toothbrush with ya!”
CAT, true to form, ignored the very agitated man disappearing through the very same door behind the judicial bench, where he'd previously and just so recently entered. CAT now simply stood—tall, calm, and dignified at the defense table, listening as the buzz and murmur of the gallery spectators now clearly turned into loud giggles and outright laughter to follow that disappearing judge.

EPILOGUE
Veronica Backpage
Chapter 1
“Veronica, may I have your attention? Summer vacation hasn’t started yet.”
It’s the end of the school term, and all Veronica can think about is slipping into overalls and working with her dad at the boatyard. Miss Jensen’s reprimand brings her back to the moment. “Thank you. Class, I am passing out a notebook. It’s not just any notebook; it’s a journal. It should be used to record important or significant events in your life. Next year, you’ll be a freshman in high school, and Mr. Stone will expect you to write about your summer. Recording your summer events will prepare you for the writing assignment. Any questions?”
Veronica raises her hand. “Miss Jensen?”
“Yes, Veronica.”
“How do we start? We’re pretty dull.”
The class laughs mildly, as does Miss Jensen. “If you think your summer will be dull,” Miss Jensen continues, “you can talk to your parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles to gain insight into their lives and how they shaped you.”
The class groans. “It’s only a suggestion,” their teacher responds. “You should not treat this as a one-time assignment but rather as an ongoing journal of your life. This is not for a grade! It’s to help you organize your thoughts and, of course, to improve your writing. Class is dismissed.”
Veronica has been very interested in writing. She wants to be a teacher. She likes Miss Jensen and has really taken her suggestions to heart, especially the journal idea. But she doesn’t have time to write today because she’s on her way to the boatyard to work with her dad, Stan.
Veronica runs into the boatyard, which is on the inlet side of Isle City, New Jersey. She heads for the office/shed to change from her school skirt and blouse into her work jeans, denim top, and deck shoes. She is tall for her 13 years but has not reached menarche yet. She takes after her dad, slender in the hips and angular. If not for her round, feminine face, so like her mother’s, she could be mistaken for a boy.
Stan, a strapping mariner at six feet two inches and a solid 200 pounds, has left her a list of tasks to complete. Summer means the “swells” will be moving to the shore for the season. They are mostly from Philadelphia, own their summer homes, and have boats. The mothers and children stay through most of the summer, while dads come in on Friday and go back on Sunday. They expect their boats to be ready for the water. Stan and his full-time crew of two work throughout the year to maintain the boats.
Veronica loves working on the boats, and she loves sailing. She recalls the first time she came into the yard when she was nine. Dad gave her a block of wood and coarse sandpaper to work on a boat hull, then took her out for a sail as a reward for her work. She liked the wind in her face, with her black hair flying behind her, and enjoyed the sense of freedom found on the water. Stan is happy that she has taken to sea life.
When she was 10, Stan gave her more responsibility. She did some painting and cleaned out the galleys of the boats in the dry dock area on the south side of the yard. She preferred being outdoors and around the boats rather than working at home or in the family bakery, where she was always mediating spats between her Aunt Nicoletta and her grandmother Magdalena.
The first language Veronica learned was Italian because her mom, Concetta, and Aunt Nicki are Italian. When Vee was younger, Aunt Nicki spent a lot of time with her niece while Concetta, who also speaks English, ran the bakery. Stan is Polish, so he speaks fluent Polish and fairly good English. Grandma Magdalena, Stan’s mom, is a big, outspoken blonde woman who loves her grandchildren. When she came to live with them, she only spoke Polish, and even now, she stubbornly wants to speak only her native tongue.
Vee, who eventually learned both Italian and Polish, was put in the middle between a hard-headed Italian diva aunt and a stubborn Polish grandmother. While they shouted and gestured in their native tongues, Vee would try to mediate and resolve the issue of the day. She was definitely learning how to be a diplomat, but working with her dad in the boatyard allowed her to escape that mayhem. She was thinking about this as she put her new journal next to her school clothing before starting work on the sloop.
Vee started sanding the hull of the 36-foot sloop Stan had salvaged from one of the other yards on the inlet. He had made a good deal for it because it was in terrible shape and needed a ton of work. As Vee became more skilled in her boatyard duties, Stan let her start working on the hull of the sloop. Over the past few years, dad and daughter have made significant improvements to the craft.
As the day comes to an end, Stan calls, “Veronica, pick up your clothing. Mom’s got dinner, so let’s go. You can continue working tomorrow.” The two of them head home.
The next morning, Vee rises a bit earlier than usual and sees the journal from Miss Jensen sitting on her dresser, still unopened and blank. As she brushes her hair, she recalls the guidelines that Miss Jensen had suggested to the class. On the way to the yard, she develops some ideas about what to write. She knows that her dad will give her time off to go out for a sail since daylight is longer now. She can think about the journal while sailing.
At the end of the day, Vee completes her duties quickly and efficiently. “Hey, Dad, can I take the Scatterboxx for a couple of hours?”
“Did you check the barometer for weather?”
“Yes, Sir,” she replies in an amused tone. Dad laughs. “Go ahead, you old salt.”
As she leaves, Stan ruminates on his family. He loves Vee and appreciates her desire to work with him instead of in the bakery. Overall, though, he’s thankful for his whole family. The twins, Helena and Stella, like helping in the kitchen and bakery. They look somewhat like Vee, with about the same angular facial structure and features, but they have a lighter hair color, bordering on dirty blonde. They have the coloring of their grandmother, Magdalena, and they are more petite than their sister and don’t like getting down and dirty like Vee. Their little brother, Thad, is still too young to determine where he fits. He looks more like Connie, with a darker complexion and black hair, but has Stan’s frame. They certainly have a blended family, Stan thinks to himself.
Vee has become quite proficient at handling sailing vessels and powerboats. She easily navigates the 14-foot sailboat with a single mast through the waterway to the ocean, concentrating on tacking on the outward leg. When she reaches a position far enough out, she comes about to the downwind leg. She loves this part of sailing. She’s in control—the captain! But she has realized that her long hair is a problem when sailing alone. She knows it’s time to wear it shorter.
When she’s almost to the mouth of the channel, she drops the sail and kicks in the outboard to take her back to the yard. She starts to think about her first journal entry. Once docked, with the sails furled and the boat secured, she goes to the office to pick up her journal. Stan is waiting for her. Vee asks her dad where his helpers, Carl and Phil, are.
“I sent them home early. Tomorrow is going to be a long day. Four boats have to be ready for Saturday. The swells are coming with their sailors. Everything must be perfect.”
After discussing the details for Saturday, Vee tells her dad about the journal. “I want to know how you met Mom and why you love the sea and the United States.”
He laughs. “I’ll tell you no lies, but there isn’t a grain of truth in any sea story a swabbie will tell you!”
“When will you talk to me?”
“I’ll tell you a bit of it each day on the ride home.”
Once home, Vee cleans up and then checks to see if any disagreements have broken out between Aunt Nicki and Grandma. Luckily, Helena confirms that all is well. Vee will spend some time after dinner helping Grandma with English and then will help Aunt Nicki later.
Connie is glad that Vee can handle the family’s language education. That allows Connie an extra hour of sleep. She is always up earlier than the rest of the family so she can get to the bakery to start the bread. She then returns home to start breakfast for the family.
Connie needs help in the bakery. Her sister and mother-in-law are quite good in the back end of the bakery, but their English competency is so poor that they can’t help at the counter. This challenge is why Connie enlisted Vee to teach English. Now, Aunt Nicki and Grandma can almost fight in English, and even better, they can help at the counter.
Vee often wonders how her parents, two people from such diverse backgrounds, came together. Maybe Miss Jensen’s suggestion was a good starting point after all. Vee takes the blank journal out to the porch, where the light from the table lamp inside shines through to the porch table. It’s barely adequate but enough for Vee to complete her first entry, a condensed version of her day.
The next day, Vee’s in the truck waiting for Stan. It’s a ten-minute drive to the yard, so Vee has prepared some questions to ask her dad on the ride. As she starts to ask her first question, he puts her off. “I’m concerned about some problems at work and some comments from Harold.”
The swells on the boats and the boatyard. Some also own big mansions with scenic ocean views in the high-end neighborhoods. In Vee’s mind, they are beyond rich. These wealthy men chose some of their members to serve on a board that oversees boatyard operations. Stan reports to these board members and their commodore. Vee knows the commodore is the most important boss. She also knows her dad worries when he has to meet with this group because they control the destiny of his family.
When they arrive, Stan sees that Carl and Phil are already working on the rigging of the commodore’s boat, a sleek 44-foot sloop. It has all the brass and teak to make it an impressive craft. Stan sends Vee to help Carl and Phil. Carl glances over his shoulder, sees Vee, and calls to her, “Vee, can you climb up and rig this halyard?” Vee scampers up the mast like an old salt.
Carl is older; he’s an experienced blue-water sailor and sailmaker. Phil is younger, about six feet tall and burly, with tattoo sleeves on both arms. Stan hired Phil to work with the engines. He works in the north building, where he has a dedicated area to maintain and, when necessary, rebuild engines. Phil finishes his check on the engine, greets Vee, and then heads to his engine shop. Vee will work the rest of the day with Carl.
Chapter 2
“Vee, are you going to help me instruct the potential young sailors starting next week?” asks Carl. “Did my dad approve that?”
“Sure did, and that means you’ll be able to spend some time on the water.” As they continue to work on the rigging, Vee rambles on with questions about what to teach the sailing students. Carl responds, “You know that the first lessons your dad insists on are about water safety, which means swimming, using safety equipment, and … you know the drill.”
Once the rigging is complete, it’s lunchtime. As they eat, Vee reflects on why she likes working with Carl. He was married as a younger man, but his wife died in childbirth while he was away at sea. Immersed in guilt and grief, he started drinking and lost his sailing license. Her dad had befriended Carl at the hiring hall when both men were still sailing. When Stan got the job here, he got in touch with Carl and hired him. Carl is beholden to Stan, and he treats Vee like a niece. He literally helped her “learn the ropes,” and he’s the only blue-water sailor in the area besides her dad. Vee knows she’ll be working with the novice group while Carl handles the intermediate group.
Later in the afternoon, Phil needs Carl to help him pull an engine, and Stan has to work on schedules for updating the repair and maintenance of the boats. With everyone else busy, Vee heads over to her family’s salvaged sloop. There’s always something to do. The hull is in good shape after almost two years of sanding, scraping, caulking, and painting, and the cabin is clean. Now, they need to work on the deck, mast, and rigging to make her seaworthy. Vee starts working on the standing and running lines.
Meanwhile, Stan has been immersed in his reports for the Commodore. Realizing it’s almost dinner time, he goes to the door. “Vee, secure and clean up. We need to get home for dinner. Meet at the truck.”
Once they are both in the truck, Stan says, “I’ve thought about a few of your questions. I’ll give you a little bit each day, but don’t push it.” Vee responds, “I’m listening.”
“I grew up on a farm in Poland. I hated it. When I was about 15, I ran away to the sea. I didn’t like the cold, so I headed to Greece, to the Aegean Sea, which was beautiful, sunny, and warm. It was heaven! I was able to work on an inter-island freighter, a schooner, and a fine sailing vessel. They never asked me my age because I was big. That’s where I learned how to sail. That’s it for today; we’re home.”
Vee says hello to the family and runs upstairs to write down the revelations from her dad. When Vee is out of earshot, Stan asks Connie whether Vee has begun menstruating. Connie nods yes. “She’s got to wear a heavier top or wrap her chest,” he tells his wife. “Her nipples were showing!”
“Yes, she’s becoming a woman,” Connie agrees, “and you remember when you saw me for the first time, you went right for my breasts… and nipples. I’ll approach her about it and tell her I noticed.”
“With the swells coming in, I want to be sure they don’t think they can have their way with her,” Stan says. As he turns to walk away, Connie says, “Stan, remember that she’s not just a trained seaman. She’s your daughter. I’ll have a talk with her.”
Stan turns around, looks deep into Connie’s dark eyes, then gives her a hug and kisses her neck. He loves the dark, sensuous look of his Italian lady.
The next morning, Vee comes to breakfast with shorter hair and a looser, heavier shirt. Stan nods in approval to Connie. Father and daughter head to the yard. As they arrive, Stan sees Carl talking with Harold Winton, one of the board members. Harold is Stan’s immediate superior and is the person who recommended Stan for the job. He has been a supporter of Stan and his crew since he hired him in 1901, twelve years earlier. Stan greets Harold, and they go into the office. Carl calls Vee over, and they head toward another sloop to check the sails and rigging.
Phil shows up. Seeing that there is someone with Stan, he decides to check on the fuel supply nearby, which is something he usually does later in the day. He’s interested in what’s going on in the office—maybe too interested.
After a little chit-chat, Stan asks Harold, “Is there a problem? I spoke with the commodore a few days ago, and he cut me short a few times.”
“Stan, I’m here to warn you that some of the new blood is pushing for a change,” Harold replies. “The commodore and I still have leverage, but just be alert for anything unusual.” Stan nods. “I appreciate that you gave me notice.” Harold continues, “By the way, Stan, you know that on the Fourth of July, there will be a big fireworks celebration down the coast. The commodore wants you to sail his boat so he can entertain his guests, most of whom have never been on a sailing vessel. Be sure you have a good mate.”
“I’ll get Carl to crew with me,” says Stan. Harold suggests that Carl and Phil need to handle the 50-foot tour boat. The two men exchange a friendly handshake. Stan understands Harold’s advice.
The rest of the day is uneventful. Vee is anxious to find out more about her dad. At the end of the day, they climb into the truck. Vee is beaming. “Go on,” she says, “you were in the Aegean.”
“OK,” he agrees. “I worked for about four years in the inter-island trade. I learned passable Greek so that I could learn good seamanship. Those Greeks made me a first mate, and if I had stayed longer, they would have let me skipper one of their boats. OK, we’re home.”
As they walk to the house, Stan smiles and looks at Vee. He tells her about the Fourth of July crewing duty and announces that she will be his first mate. Vee jumps with enthusiasm. She tells her mom, aunt, grandmother, sisters, and anyone within earshot. Excitedly, she heads upstairs to journal about Stan’s revelations to her and her new crew status. She looks in the mirror, repeating, “First mate, I’m a first mate!”
The work in the yard continues. Vee instructs the novices for one hour each weekday. Her students range in age from eight to fourteen. Most of the older youths are in Carl’s classes.
Vee is getting a taste of being a teacher. When not teaching or helping Carl with his group, she tends to the cabins on the boats to ensure they’re clean for the owners and their guests on the weekend when the husbands come out to the shore. When time permits, she works on the family sloop.
On the ride home, Vee discovers that her dad was able to get his seaman’s license for large ships at age 18. He started as an able seaman and, after four years, became a bosun’s mate. His specialty was moving cargo and people in small crafts from ports that had no port facilities.
Vee keeps asking about her mom. Finally, Stan shares some insights about meeting Connie. “Having been in Greece, I found I liked dark, shapely women. They penetrated my soul.” He laughs. “But Mom was in Italy, wasn’t she?” Vee asks.
“Yes. Our one regular port was Naples. I was helping the cook by picking up supplies. I was told about this one bakery that was family-owned and operated. They had great bread and pastries. I walked in for the first time and saw your mom behind the counter. She had some flour on her cheek, but it could not hide her beautiful face. When she saw me, she broke into a delicious smile, and I could see into the depths of her dark eyes, which were stunning. She was shorter than the Polish women I knew in my teens, but she had the figure of a classic beauty. And her eyes—her eyes just glistened and pierced my heart. Then, I ordered from your mom the best I could in gibberish Italian. She asked if I spoke American, and I gestured no. Anyway, we worked out a deal, and I took their baked goods back to the ship.”
Vee coaxed, “And …”
Stan is starting to feel a little uncomfortable. He suggests that Vee talk with her mom at this point. They have reached home, and Stan goes to wash up while Vee heads to her mom to find out more. Connie says, “I’ll tell you more after dinner. Now, set the table. Your sisters are with your aunt, trying to shop.” She chuckles, and Vee grins. The twins know how to work Aunt Nicki. They both will come home with something new.
After dinner, the twins clean up under the supervision of Grandmama. From Italian/English while shopping to Polish/English cleaning up, the twins are picking up both languages. Vee goes to her room to pick up her journal, then finds her mom, who’s on the back porch getting vegetables ready for tomorrow’s dinner. She’ll be up early to start the bread for the bakery. Her customers, usually the maids and cooks of the swells, shop in the morning. Nicki is a big help in the bakery, and the extra money from the summer swells helps carry them through the winter, but Vee knows that Connie runs the show. Vee takes care to listen and not be demanding.
Vee sits next to her mother, reaches into the bowl of green beans, and starts to help her mother. “Mom, Dad said I should ask you how you met.” She tells Connie what Dad has told her so far. Connie begins, “I kept speaking to him in American English, hoping he’d get the hint that I was learning the language so I could go to the United States. The big, dumb Pole wasn’t getting it. I liked him the first time he came into the bakery. He was tall, with a bright smile and a friendly tone to his voice when he tried to communicate. On his fifth visit, he took out a piece of paper with the English terms written on it so he could order in English.”
Vee chuckles, then reaches for more beans. “He had a shipmate from the U.S. who had started helping your dad learn English. And I, in turn, started to pick up some Polish.”
“First date?” Vee asks, like a true American child.
Connie, still shapely after four children, continues. “My parents were very strict, so I had to convince them that he was a good customer so I could talk to him. Our first date was a walk up to the lemon ice stand. He bought me a lemon ice. We talked about his schedule and when we might have future dates. But the most important thing he told me was that he wanted to go to the U.S.” Connie looks at Vee. “Your father can pick it up from here.” Vee helps Connie put the food away in the kitchen. Grandma’s cleaning crew had left everything spotless.
The next morning, Vee leaves for the boatyard with her dad, feeling anxious about the 4th. Her novice classes are over, so now she oversees the small boat schedule and cleans the cabins. In the yard, she collects her cleaning supplies and boards the first sloop. She descends into the cabin and finds a complete mess. She is not used to seeing so many empty bottles, and more than that, the room is trashed. As she cleans up, she encounters her first condom, which she picks up with a piece of newspaper. She instinctively knows this is not something she wants to talk to her dad about.
Vee finds Carl aboard the powerboat he’ll be handling on the 4th. “Carl, I found this,” she announces, unwrapping the newspaper to show him the condom. He looks at her seriously. “Does your dad know you have this?” She shakes her head. Then Carl asks, “Have you had a talk with your mother?” She nods yes, with a questioning look on her face.
“I will be blunt about this,” Carl continues. “It’s what a man puts over his male part before inserting it into a female’s opening. It’s used to prevent making babies. If you see these, do exactly what you did, then throw them in the trash bin. Be sure not to touch it.” Vee is awed by Carl’s honesty. “I won’t mention this to your dad. We’ll keep it to ourselves. You’re coming of age, and the yard is not usually friendly to women.”
“Thanks, Carl, for not treating me like a little kid. I appreciate that,” Vee replies warmly. Then she continues on to clean the next boat.
Later in the day, Vee runs into Carl again on his way to the rope locker. “By the way, which boat did that thing you found come from?” he asks. “The Phillips’ boat,” Vee replies. “Oh, OK,” Carl says, then continues to the locker. He knows that the Phillips family has four boys who are handfuls. The other night, he saw the two older boys, with their friends and a few local girls, going out for the evening. He’s not a prude, but he also knows that Mr. Phillips himself is not always a stand-up guy. Carl realizes he needs to let Stan know.
The day is over, and Stan and Vee hop in the truck. Stan looks at his daughter quizzically. She wonders if Carl told him about the condom, but then Stan says, “Where did I leave off? Oh yes, meetings with your mother. We spent a lot of our early meetings talking in our personal dialect, which involved hand and arm gestures,” he says, chuckling. Vee understands—that’s what she had to do with her aunt and grandmother early on. Now, both women have enough understanding of English to get by.
“Naples was a regular port,” Stan continues, “so about every two weeks, we would bring our cargo, unload, then secure a load back to Greece. I would be in port for 2-3 days, and we would spend as much time together as we could. Eventually, I told her I was going to ship out on a transocean freighter to New York. My English was good enough to get hired. I told her that it would give me the opportunity to check out America. So, I signed on and made two crossings. I’ll continue this story tomorrow. For now, let’s eat.”
Vee is thankful that Carl didn’t tell on her, but she needs to know more about sex and babies. She finds Connie sitting in her chair on the porch after dinner. She approaches her mother with a serious expression and sits down next to her. She asks for more details about having a baby. Connie had given Vee the basic talk about six months earlier, but she realizes that Vee now needs more than just the ins and outs of sperm deposition. Her interest has intensified.
Connie spends about 40 minutes recapping their first talk and then adds information about venereal disease, birth control, abortion, and adoption to the discussion. Most importantly, Connie emphasizes that the girl bears the stigma of these actions and consequences. Vee is surprised to hear her mother stress that men have the upper hand in sex and voice this opinion so strongly. Vee mulls over their conversation as she goes to journal about today’s happenings. She enters her notes on their talk and then notes that tomorrow is July 1st, only three days before her assignment as a first mate.
The next morning, Stan and Vee arrive at the yard, and it’s back to work. The men have their monthly record-keeping duties. Vee is a math whiz and has started helping Connie with the bakery bookkeeping. So, Carl, Phil, and Stan now have her check their columns of numbers as well.
Vee goes to Carl’s table, and he winks at her to let her know everything is cool. She asks Phil if he needs help, and he curtly says no. Vee has noticed that he’s been grumpier lately. He’s always been somewhat of a grump, but now he’s even more so.
With the national holiday fast approaching, there’s a lot of activity on the beach and at the fun parks along the Jersey shore. Vee is anxiously awaiting the 4th.
At the end of the workday, Vee gets into the truck as Stan starts the engine and continues, “I was in New York in 1897, and there was a lot of noise and activity. The U.S. and Spain were about to get into it. I had told your mother that I’d marry her on my third trip back, but the war came up. I enlisted in the U.S. Navy because that way, I could get official papers once I finished my service.” Stan pulls up by the beach and parks. “I want to finish this part today, so we’ll be a little late. When I signed up, it was for a two-year hitch. I didn’t write to your mom when I signed up, but I did write to her once the Navy told me where I was going.” Father and daughter get out of the truck and walk to a bench.
“I was assigned to a troop ship because I was a cargo specialist and small boat operator. The next thing I know, I’m handling horses! You read about President Roosevelt—well, it was his command on board my ship. I personally ferried him to Cuba. Mr. Winton was my officer. We picked up the ‘ruffians’ after the military campaign.
When we got back to the U.S., they discharged us. The war was over, so they wanted to save money. That’s when Lt. Winton offered me a job, but I told him about promising to marry your ma. He was good enough to lend me the fare to Naples so I could marry her.”
As they get up and walk back to the truck, Stan finishes, “Your mom and I were married in Naples. It was a grand wedding! The food was magnificent, and the vino seemed to flow endlessly. Then we had to get to the ship to start our new life.”
Vee asks, “Lt. Winton is Mr. Winton?” “Yes. To this day, that man has been fair, kind, and honest with me. When I tried to pay back the boat fare, he said it was his wedding gift.”
The truck stops, and Vee jumps out and runs to her room to write these new tidbits in her journal. She needs to ask her mother a few more questions, and then she’ll have the full story of Concetta DiGuarda and Stanley Mzozoski.
Chapter 3
After dinner on July 3rd, Vee and her mom take a little walk together. “Dad finished up to the wedding. He said you could tell me more,” Vee tells her mother. Connie looks longingly toward the ocean, then at Vee. “I hadn’t heard from your dad for almost a year. Your grandfather DiGuarda wanted me to marry right away. He said, ‘I have one old maid (your Aunt Nicki). I don’t want another!’ So I met other suitors, but nothing came of those dates. Finally, a bunch of letters arrived. I still have them.”
“Can I see them?” Vee asks.
“Maybe someday, but not now. In the letters, your father explained the situation and told me when he would reach Naples. He said to prepare for a wedding. I set the date for two days after his scheduled arrival to be sure he would be here. All was set, but there was no Stan.”
“What happened?” Vee asked.
“Everything! When he didn’t appear, your grandfather was furious. He vowed to shoot him on sight! Aunt Nicki helped to get him under control. Two days later, your dad arrived all dressed up and ready to go. He explained they ran into heavy seas, rain squalls, and thunderstorms. Then he missed his connection in Portsmouth, England, and lost a whole day there.”
“So he went to my father, hat in hand, and apologized in Italian. Aunt Nicki had coached him. The wedding was the next day, and we had to leave four hours later for our ship to the U.S. If we missed this one, it would be two weeks until the next ship arrived. We had a very short time with friends and relatives.”
Vee sighs, then they turn around and head back home. “Aunt Nicki is here, but will we ever see any of your family again?”
Connie shakes her head. “Probably not, and I miss them.”
They reach the house. Vee rushes upstairs to enter the conversation into her journal, then heads to bed. Tomorrow, the 4th, she’ll be the first mate!
Vee hardly slept. She is the first to get up, so she gets the coffee started and waits. Connie is next up. She was able to sleep later because the bakery will be closed on the 4th. Next, Stan comes down. He knows it will be a big day and that he’ll need to be at the top of his game since he’ll be skippering the commodore on his own boat.
Connie prepares a big breakfast for them, aware of how important this cruise is. Stan had confided to her what Winton had cautioned him about and had also told her about the condom incident that Carl had related.
Vee is excited as they get in the truck. Stan goes over the checklist from memory, and Vee responds. They hit the yard and make final preparations.
At about 11:30, a steward comes to the boat with food and drink that will be on board for the guests, and Vee helps him load everything. The steward asks where he can change since he’ll be on board to serve the guests. He tells Vee they’re having lunch and should be ready to sail in about an hour. Vee finds Stan and informs him about the schedule change and their later arrival, then goes back to the boat to continue preparations for cast-off.
Stan is a few minutes behind. He goes over the checklist once more, then he goes to the boat and asks Vee to go to the safety locker and pull another six vests, just in case.
The commodore and his party, consisting of good friends, business associates, and potential clients, arrive for a day under sail. He goes over the route with Stan and gives last-minute instructions, telling him not to bother him once at sea. He needs to spend time with his prospects. Stan has Vee check the barometer.
Vee checks with Stan on the updates, then secures the additional life jackets, placing them at strategic locations on the boat. The commodore comes aboard, acknowledges Stan, and then he and Stan greet the guests as they board for a fun day in the sun. There are two additional couples not on the original list. Good thing Vee picked up the extra jackets! She is instructed to stay away from the guests until she needs to interact with them.
After a quick tour of the boat, Vee stows the extra belongings of the guests. Now, they are ready to get underway. Vee is on the dock getting ready to pull the gangway when Carl shows up. He tells her to get on board. Stan gives the order to single up the lines. Vee heads to the engine compartment to fire up the boat, and they head to sea.
Once they reach the ocean, a cool breeze hits Stan. Vee has hoisted the sails and cut the engine. They are under sail, and she also feels the breeze. It feels almost like a warning.
Stan calls her to take the helm. He goes to notify the commodore that a storm is a possibility. The commodore tells him to continue. If it hits, it’ll be a squall, and it’ll clear, he says. Stan goes back to the helm and tells Vee to batten down everything she can. Then, they notify the caterer that a storm is likely and that he should secure what he can.
They had been out for about three hours when it started to rain. Stan starts tacking, and Vee takes charge. She trims the sails and gets the passengers into safety vests.
The commodore still thinks it’s just a passing storm. Unfortunately, the storm intensifies. Stan points the prow into the wind while Vee drops the sails. She kicks up the engine to give Stan some maneuverability. At this point, the guests are crammed into the cabin, wet and scared. The caterer is helping as much as he can, but many of the guests are heaving. It’s a mess.
Vee’s take-charge, confident voice soothes some of the passengers’ concerns. She heads back up on deck. The commodore is a sailor, so he is at the helm with Stan. The storm is taking them further out to sea, and it’s intensifying. Stan keeps eyeing Vee, but she’s fine. She remembers the first axiom in a storm: one hand for the boat, one hand for you.
Finally, the storm’s intensity begins to lessen. Vee is drenched. She goes into the cabin to check on the passengers. The men have some dry shirts, and they offer them to Vee. She accepts but tells them she’s a ‘she.’ The women chase the men out and help Vee out of her wet clothes. They wonder out loud why her dad would put her in this spot, but she defends her dad. She knows it is dangerous, she tells them, but she feels in control.
Needless to say, there’s no fireworks display this 4th of July. The storm is enough drama. Stan recalculates their position and comes about while Vee gets the sails up. A few of the passengers feel better, so they come back up on deck. The two hours back to the yard pass quickly. Stan has been a great seaman, but it’s Vee’s competence and calm that makes it more pleasant for the guests.
Once they start up the seaway toward the yard, Vee brings the sails down and drops the fenders. She is ready to jump to the dock when she sees Carl. Stan backs the engine, and Vee tosses the lines to Carl. Once tied up, the bedraggled passengers disembark. A few of the women tell Stan that Vee did a great job, but what is he thinking about letting his daughter be a common seaman? He thanks them and says she is anything but common. She handled the storm as well as any seaman he had ever served with!
The commodore and his wife are the last to leave. She thanks Stan for his skill and praises Vee, saying Vee has ‘a little Columbus in her.’ She has enjoyed the trip.
It’s now after 11 PM. Stan asks Carl to secure everything and puts a sign in the window that says, “Open at noon tomorrow.” Vee is already in the truck, asleep. He shakes his head. She is a great first mate!
A few days later, Winton stops by to talk with Stan. “Let’s go inside. I have something you’ll need to hear.”
“You first,” Stan ushers Harold into the office. “I just got off the phone with the commodore. He originally wanted me to fire you, but because of your seamanship and Vee’s professionalism, he has dropped the idea. He realizes that her actions kept people somewhat calm and that her skills as a mate couldn’t be faulted. His wife, I gather, was 4-0 on your side.”
Stan is stunned by these revelations. He sits silently for a moment, then asks, “Anything else, Harold?”
“Yes. Watch your back. One of your two guys is after your job. I’m sure you have an idea of who, but just let it go. If he goes, you’ll probably follow.
“By the way,” Harold continues, “your teaching programs are a big plus, especially with the women folk. Vee proved that there’s a place for women on the sea. I’ve been approached by several mothers to offer boating safety training to their teenage daughters. I suggest you work on a teen program for next year. Vee and Carl could work together on that, and I think I could round up some additional funding.”
On that positive note, Harold leaves. Stan feels somewhat relieved to know what’s going on behind the scenes. He suspected that Phil was the fly in the ointment.
On the way home, Stan gives Vee a positive evaluation of her work as a mate. He mentions next year but cautions Vee that she must keep up her school grades as well.
As the summer winds down and hurricane season hits the East Coast, sailing gives way to inland water sports, canoeing, crewing, and rowing. The summer rentals empty out as the swells head back to the cities. The boatyard begins to winterize the fleet of boats, and as they close up shop, Vee has more time to work on the family sloop. Her journal entries become more random and boring as inland water sports change to football.
Vee starts high school in September as more of a lady than a tomboy. Her sailing skills are the talk of the lunchroom. In a beach and tourist community, there are very few secrets among the locals. Vee engages in informal conversations about sailing. By Christmas, Vee has a list of six girls who can’t wait to actually get into a boat. Vee turns 14 in January 1914. Her gift is a new pair of deck shoes, and she’s elated.
Stan reminds Vee of the training program they plan to run during the upcoming summer. Vee and Carl start to meet regularly to outline the program. Vee suggests that they use her friends from school as a test class. They can start after Easter and finish in May. The classes would begin after school. Vee has recruited six girls from her class, three older girls, plus three boys who aren’t playing baseball.
Stan and his team focus on maintenance and yard clean-up through the winter months. Stan is fair with work duties and assumes some of the tasks himself. Vee is not scheduled but comes to work on the family boat. Since business at the yard is slow, Stan has Vee help him with the books as well. Meanwhile, she’s waiting for the swells to come back so she can start the seamanship class and get the family boat into the water.
These activities and thoughts are mentioned in her journal. She shows Miss Jensen some of her work, and the teacher offers suggestions. She’s thankful for Miss Jensen’s encouragement.
It’s been a good year so far, and Easter is coming soon. Vee and Carl are excited about the new seamanship training. As planned, the classes begin with her pre-selected group. Carl is the primary instructor, while Vee does the hands-on work with the group. It seems a little boring, but it picks up when they move to the sloop. The boats have been put back into the water by Stan, Carl, and Phil. Vee has cleaned up the cabins as well. Everything is in order so that the boats can be used for the class.
The spring air is fresh and brightens Vee’s spirits. The nip of cold from the Atlantic Ocean is exhilarating and exciting to Vee. She can’t wait to sail.
Carl and Vee break down the group of twelve into four sections: sections one and two on Monday and Wednesday, and sections three and four on Tuesday and Thursday. Everyone will meet on Fridays. The sections are sailing groups. Two spatter boxes go out each afternoon, Monday through Thursday, to sail. The students are having a fun time. On Fridays, they recap their good and bad practices. By the fourth week (which is the second sailing week), they actually get out to the ocean. It’s a little more intense, but the kids are enjoying it. Most of them want more. When the session ends, school is almost out. Based on the feedback from this first session, Carl and Vee finalize their plans for the next classes.
Work intensifies at the yard. Stan gets an OK from Mr. Winton to bring three students on to help with boat cleaning during June and July. Stan talks to Carl and Vee to get suggestions about which three should come from the class. Vee suggests two girls, one from her class and one older, because they stand out. Vee can use the girls as her clean-up crew. Carl can assign the boy to help Phil with the power boats, and Carl can use him when he’s working on rigging and sails.
The swells are returning for the summer. Registration begins for the classes, and there is a sense that the families are enthusiastic about the new programs. It should be a great summer.
The regular classes are set, so Carl and Vee focus on the special classes. It’s a mixed group. One boy catches Vee’s attention. He’s tall and broad-shouldered, with a hardened jaw and deep, penetrating blue eyes. Vee checks the roster; he’s Steven Phillips, whose dad is the commodore. He is the youngest of the four boys. He and his three friends, John, Phil, and Mike, are almost never apart. All have signed up for the special class.
Whenever her schedule permits, Vee checks in on the session Steve is in as a chance to learn more about him and increase the potential for an encounter. But the classes are almost over, and there’s been no contact.
Vee, her cleaning crew, and the other girls who completed the first sailing class plan to get together in the warm summer breeze of August. Vee arranges for a bigger vessel to take them all to an inlet where they can relax and swim. Most of the girls don’t have swimsuits, so they decide to skinny dip. By the end of the day, they have such a great time that they decide to do it again the following week.
Meanwhile, Matt, the male student working in the yard, has started befriending Steve and his friends. After overhearing the girls’ plan for their next swim, Matt passes the information to the boys, along with advice about the best location to view the girls without being seen. He reminds them that they’ll need binoculars to see the girls discreetly.
The next day, Steve, his friends, and a few other boys arrive ahead of the girls at their hiding spot. One boy, Tom, wants to make sure he doesn’t miss a thing, so instead of binoculars, he brings a telescope.
They see it all! Steve can’t stop looking at Vee, admiring her shapely curves, flat abdomen, and rounded, supple breasts. He is also drawn to her confident attitude. He’ll be a junior this year, and he is determined to get to know Vee better.
As the summer ends, Steve approaches Vee. “Would you like to go for some ice cream? I really like you.” Vee is excited but knows Stan will not allow this. “Steve, I can’t. I have chores to do at home.”
“Well,” Steve counters, “I’m leaving tomorrow because football practice is starting. Can we write over the winter?” Vee blushes a little, turns aside for a moment, and then replies, “Yes!” They exchange addresses, and Vee feels a secret thrill.
Chapter 4
School has started, and the buzz around campus is all about the skinny-dipping party. A few boys now have firsthand knowledge of what young girls look like without their swimsuits. Once that gossip has run its course, the next topic is Vee’s sloop.
Thanks to the extra help in the boatyard this summer, Stan, Vee, and her brother Thad have finally finished rehabilitating the sloop. With the fall being warm and no imminent hurricanes, Stan decides they can launch her. Carl and Phil are ready to help, and Vee has lined up her cleaning crew for the final polish once the sloop is afloat. The girls have agreed to work in exchange for being part of the sailing crew.
On Monday, the sloop is put in the water. On Tuesday, they test the rebuilt engine and cruise the inlet. Wednesday, they hoist the used and patched sail to see if they can take it out under sail. Thursday, they tweak the lines, and by Friday, Vee’s crew makes the vessel shipshape for Saturday’s trip.
Saturday morning arrives, and everyone but Phil (who takes the day off) is there at 7:00 AM! Stan and Carl are experienced, while Vee’s crew of six girls and three guys (including “Telescope Tom”) is anxious. They’ve sailed on small boats, but this is their first time on a larger craft. Thad is excited to join Dad and Sis for this inaugural outing.
Stan takes the helm, with Thad by his side as they power down the inlet. Carl and Vee assign duties to the crew, and Carl announces that Vee is the first mate and tactician. The crew looks puzzled—what is a tactician? Carl explains, “It’s the person who manages the wind, the sails, and the course.”
They break out onto the ocean. For many of the crew, this is their first experience on blue water. After initial oohs and ahhs, they realize they have work to do. They sail for several hours before heading back to port. Everyone has had a great day and wants to do it again next Saturday. Vee tells her dad, “The crew had a fantastic time and would like to go out again next weekend. Can we?” “That’s possible,” he replies. “We have a few bugs to work out, but I think we’ll be ready. Tell them 8:00 AM, rain or shine.”
Back at home, Vee has plenty to journal about. Even better, she has received her first letter from Steve, who writes about football and mentions scoring four touchdowns this season. He also talks about all the pretty girls who throw themselves at the football hero. Vee doesn’t take this seriously—she knows he’s teasing to impress her. She contemplates writing a similar letter but decides to downplay her sailing successes, as she has a lot of work to finish for the coming week.
When Saturday comes, they take the sloop out in a rainstorm with some swells. The youngsters think it’s a wild ride, which it is. The adjustments that Carl and Stan made hold up well. After battling the elements for five hours, the rain stops, and a favorable wind races them home.
Vee’s classmates prove themselves to be good sailors on their final sail of the season, and she feels proud of them. But now it’s time to put the sloop in dry dock for the winter and for the kids to concentrate on school.
By the week after Thanksgiving, Vee has caught up on her journaling despite her schoolwork and all the letters from Steve. His letters have become less boastful and more informational, and she responds by sharing more of herself.
With the Christmas holiday approaching, Vee is torn. She has saved some money from what her dad has paid her. Should she send a gift to Steve or contribute to a new sail? Finally, she decides against sending a gift to Steve, at least this year. He has more than enough nice things, and she doesn’t want him to think she’s chasing him. But the sail is a different matter.
Every June 14th, Flag Day, there’s a sailing race from Cape May to Lewes, Delaware. Vee knows that Stan believes entering the race would be good public relations for the yard and would bring in more business. She also knows her dad allowed her classmates to be trained so they could compete.
The commodore is reluctant to put up the $30 entry fee, feeling that Stan’s sloop can’t compete with the Navy’s two sloops, manned with midshipmen, that enter every year. The Navy has won the racing cup for all five years the race has been held.
There is, however, one way they could enter the event. An individual boat can be entered for a $50 fee, but it must qualify in an earlier race. Winning an initial race is Stan’s hope, but to do this, he needs a new sail, and a spinnaker would be a real plus on the downwind leg. Vee knows that boys will be needed to handle the spinnaker.
The two new sails would cost about $500. Dad has saved about $280, while Vee has about $35 to contribute. As the Christmas shopping season begins, Connie calls a family meeting around the dining room table. “Stan, Vee, and Thad, you’ve worked hard salvaging that heap of a boat. I know you’ve saved money for new sails and gifts. I don’t want any gifts this Christmas. Use the money for your sails, and here’s $210 I’ve been able to save from you all.” The family bursts into laughter.
Stan rises to speak. “Connie, I know how hard you, your sister, my mother, and the girls work. That money should buy something for you…”
“Hush, Stan. I talked it over with everybody. The boat is ours, too. It’s a family gift.”
And that was that. Christmas came and went with everyone receiving something small in their stockings—fruit and homemade cookies that felt special to all of them.
Now the hard work began for Stan and Carl. They designed the mainsail, using every inch of canvas the boat could carry. The spinnaker was a no-brainer, and Carl designed a delivery system. Then Stan came up with the idea of weighing the centerboard, which would enable the sails to tilt into the wind so the boat could knife through the water.
The new year arrives, and Vee turns 15. War in Europe is the topic of discussion. Will the U.S. get involved? She writes to Steve about the progress on the sloop and the plans to try to race it in June. Steve responds, saying it sounds like fun.
Vee has also lined up the crew for the race, and they start meeting in February to review seaman duties and positions. A racing sloop requires different crew roles because the goal is speed. As the weather begins to warm in March, they go to the yard, practice their positions, and start getting the boat seaworthy.
Stan must register the craft to enter, but it needs a name. Vee suggests “Turtle One” because of how long it took to prepare it for racing. Everyone agrees. By the end of March, the paperwork is completed. Now they need to get the boat in the water, rig her with the new sails, and finish in the top three of a qualifying race to compete in the main event.
April becomes a busy month in the boatyard. Not only must they prepare Turtle One for the race, but they must also get all the member boats ready to be launched and cleaned up for the season. Phil has become more involved because there are more powerboats to prepare than sailing crafts. Meanwhile, Carl has taken on additional tasks so that Stan can focus on Turtle One.
Unexpectedly, Stan receives a call from Commodore Phillips, who reprimands him for not getting a boat and crew from the yard to enter. Stan reminds him that the commodore had refused to spend $30 to enter last fall. Nevertheless, the commodore insists that his boat be entered, and he wants Stan to sail it. Stan replies that he can’t because he’s on the paperwork for Turtle One. “Carl can be your skipper, but he’ll need a crew,” he offers.
“OK,” says the commodore. “I have four sons, and they have friends. Go ahead and enter my boat. I will have my crew there on the eighth of June to prepare for the race.”
Stan, Vee, and the crew prepare for the first preliminary race on May 23rd. They have worked hard, but this will be the first pressure the crew experiences. There are six girls and three guys: Vee, Thad, and Stan. From a distance, the crew looks like boys. Vee cautions the girls to guard themselves against distractions and stay focused on their sailing duties, which will force the guys to do the same.
They enter the preliminary race, starting slowly but tacking nicely into a good position for the downwind leg. They pop the spinnaker, but there’s a bit of confusion when unruffling it. This small error could mean a lower place. Nevertheless, they close in at the finish to place third, qualifying them for the finals.
Stan wants them to enter the next preliminary race for a little more practice on June 1st. On race day, everyone works in unison, and they place second by 12 seconds. Vee realizes that the winner stole some wind from Turtle One. She has been charting the races in her journal, so she notes this information as well.
Vee receives a letter from Steve, telling her that his father’s boat has also been entered in the race. Curious, she asks her dad, who tells her the story. “I’m not going to roll over for them,” she tells Stan firmly.
The commodore’s crew arrives at the yard on June 8th, and they are cocky. They have a few sailors on their crew as well. Carl takes them out and informs Stan that they aren’t as coordinated as Stan’s team—they’re too interested in getting a beer when they return. Nevertheless, Stan trusts Carl to do his best, and Carl knows how hard the Turtle One kids have worked for the race.
On race day, the Turtle One team arrives at the yard early. Connie has a surprise—she and Aunt Nicki have made matching shirts for the crew. “Now you look like a team!” Connie exclaims. Stan adds, “I am proud of all the hard work you’ve put in for this race. Just stay calm, don’t panic, listen for the orders, and execute.”
They head to the boat and start pre-race prep. The commodore’s crew arrives at the last minute. Steve gives Vee a half-hearted salute, showing no respect for her crew. He doesn’t know what awaits him.
Meanwhile, Phil prepares the power launch for the spectators. Sixteen boats queue for the start. The Navy sloops are decked out in traditional blue and gold, with midshipmen in uniform. From the judging vessel, the commissioner fires the cannon to start the race. The Navy boats take the lead, but Vee positions Turtle One behind the second Navy vessel. Carl starts in about tenth place.
The tack enables Vee to pass Navy 2. She has learned how to steal wind! They are still about 95 seconds behind Navy 1. The midshipmen glance over their shoulders at Turtle One, puzzled by their presence. As the boats approach the turn into the downwind leg, Vee’s crew executes the spinnaker position flawlessly. They are on Navy 1’s port quarter, and then Turtle One has the wind, the lead, and the trophy!
They beat both Navy boats with a winning time of 2 minutes and 18 seconds. The Navy is stunned but gives a respectful salute to the winners. Carl’s boat finishes in 12th place, over 20 minutes behind the winner.
Once the race concludes, the boats head to their home ports. The Cape May Yacht Club, sponsor of the event, will host a dinner to present the trophy. However, Turtle One’s victory presents a problem for the club. Since the winning boat is unaffiliated, does the club have to pay for their dinners? The Navy midshipmen hear about this and offer their dinners, shaming the club. The commissioner phones Stan the next day and invites them to be guests at the dinner. Stan is elated and tells Vee that this will be a swanky affair, so everyone should wear their best clothes.
Vee doesn’t have anything nice except her old confirmation dress, so Connie, Aunt Nicki, and Grandma get to work. Vee was a 32A when the dress was made, but now she’s a 36B, so the first task is to let out the chest area. She’s also three inches taller at 5’6”, so the hem needs adjusting. When the alterations are complete, the dress—and Vee—are stunning.
The Turtle One crew meets at the boatyard at 4:30 PM so they can go together. Stan has rented a tour bus for the occasion, and the drive takes about an hour.
When they arrive at the club, they are in awe. The valet asks if they are lost, as this is a dinner for race winners. Stan assures him they are the winning team. The valet smiles wryly, eager to see the fireworks.
The club’s commissioner approaches the bus and asks, “Who are you?” “We are the winners,” Stan replies. “We were expecting your team, not children!” the commodore exclaims. “I assure you, these are the sailors who crewed Turtle One.”

Introduction
Identity theft is a pervasive and evolving threat that has become increasingly prevalent in the digital age. The author’s own experience inspired this book. There are many forms of identity theft, and the statistics are astounding. We will look at ways the reader can use to protect themselves, but a word of caution is advisable here. No matter what steps you take or what anti-theft apps you install on your devices, the thieves are constantly staying up to date and they will eventually find a way around your protections. The lesson to be learned is; if you want to protect yourself, you must keep up to date with the changes in technology. When you are the victim, you are on your own to fight back and fight back you must. Local and federal authorities offer little help because experience has taught them the perpetrators are usually based in a foreign country and they cannot offer you much help.
Identity theft is one of the fastest-growing crimes globally, with millions of cases reported annually. According to the Federal Trade Commission, Americans lost $8.8 billion to identity theft in 2022 alone and it has grown exponentially ever since. Identity theft presents itself in many forms. It involves credit card fraud, tax refund fraud, medical history theft, and even creating a fake identity using your own information.
The thieves use different methods to accomplish their goals. Phishing is a common method which involves fraudulent emails, texts, or phone calls tricking victims into sharing personal information. Another method is when cybercriminals breach large databases containing personal data from companies. Skimming is another method where your information is acquired at ATMs or point-of-sale locations. Others are mail theft where the thief gets your mail containing sensitive information about you.

The theft may result in the victim’s loss of money directly or even the cost of attempting to resolve the problems. This fraud can leave the victim with great harm to their credit history, making it difficult for them to obtain loans or even renting a place to live or obtaining a job. On average, it requires 7 to 200 hours to recover from identity theft and can sometimes require years, depending on the level of the theft complexity.
Avoiding identity theft requires using strong, unique passwords and changing them regularly. Monitor bank accounts and credit reports for unauthorized transactions. You should shred sensitive documents before disposal. Avoid sharing personal information over unsecured networks with unverified entities. Lastly, use identity theft protection services for monitoring and alerts.
In conclusion, protecting your identity in this technological age is difficult and can be catastrophic. You must constantly be cautious when sharing your personal information. Even with all your efforts, you can become a victim and if it happens, you must be prepared to act alone because you will get little help from anyone else.
Chapter One Getting to Know Dan Green
Dan Green, aged 45, is a handsome and athletic middle-aged man who exemplifies success in the world of investment banking. Born and reared in a modest Atlanta neighborhood by middle-class parents, Dan showed a keen interest in numbers and finance from an early age.

He began his professional journey with a clear goal – to make a mark in the world of investments. Dan realized his dreams with the power of strategic decision-making, a relentless drive to climb to the top of the ladder in his field, and with an unwavering commitment to excellence in investment banking,
Dan’s success was not an overnight phenomenon; it resulted from long, hard work, dedication, and a deep understanding of the financial world.

Dan’s investment philosophy revolves around asset diversification, risk management, and long-term growth potential. By thorough analysis of market data, economic indicators, and industry trends, he identified undervalued assets, emerging markets, and high-growth sectors that resulted in his accumulation of great wealth. Through shrewd investments in stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets, Dan built a robust investment portfolio, delivering impressive returns year after year. Recent reports show Dan’s investment portfolio shows an impressive average annual return of 20%, significantly outperforming market benchmarks. Dan has navigated volatile market conditions and economic downturns through his diversified asset holdings, risk management, and capital preservation and is actively involved in early formation.
One of Dan’s most notable investment successes was backing a tech startup that became a billion-dollar company. Early in the company’s growth phase, he recognized the disruptive potential of emerging technology and invested actively, reaping substantial rewards and solidifying his reputation as a visionary investor. This uncanny foresight demonstrated Dan’s ability to identify investment opportunities ahead of other investors.
Outside his work, Dan is known to be a very generous supporter of many charitable organizations, including United Way, Habitat for Humanity, and his Methodist Church. Since his father was a wounded Vietnam Veteran, Dan can always be counted on for any Veteran’s cause. He provides financial support and loves participating actively in whatever charity he is involved with.
Dan’s private life revolves around his wife, Amy, aged 44, also from modest means, who is pretty, well-educated, and with a winsome personality. Dan and Amy’s love story began in the hallways of their high school. In addition to his love of mathematics and investing, Dan was a star on the high school football team, and Amy was a beautiful cheerleader, one of the most popular girls in school who never met a stranger. With Dan and Amy, it was love at first sight.
Amy is also a very busy lady in town. She is a leader in the Atlanta Botanical Society and the flower guild in her church. Every Sunday, her flower arrangements are greatly admired, and they add much beauty to the service. Amy also makes time each week for her church choir practice and their Sunday performance. She is an active member of the Feeding the Hungry organization, where she helps prepare and serve hot, nutritious meals for Atlanta’s homeless population.
Today, they find themselves happily married but with no children due to Amy’s infertility. Amy has accepted this fact and adjusted her life to volunteering at their church, garden club, and other community projects. The couple also enjoy hosting extravagant and unforgettable parties at their home just a few houses down from the Governor’s mansion. Their parties are not just social gatherings; they are grand affairs eagerly anticipated by all lucky enough to receive an invitation. Besides the social aspects of the parties, they are designed to be the perfect venue for guests to make new friends and business opportunities for the men as The guest lists always include local, state, and national politicians, regardless of their political persuasion. The parties offer the perfect opportunity for guests to have fundraisers for the office holders and often lead to appointments to some obscure government agency that gives the appointees inside information that is invaluable for investment opportunities.
One of the allures of Dan and Amy’s parties is the meticulous attention to detail that they put into every aspect of the event. From the exquisite decorations to the delectable gourmet dishes and the carefully chosen guest list, everything is thoroughly planned to ensure that each party is a memorable experience for all attendees.
Another factor of Dan and Amy’s parties is their keen understanding of their guests. Amy is the chief party planner, and she spends much time getting to know the guest’s preferences and tastes, ensuring that each party is tailored to suit the interests of those in attendance. This personalized approach has earned them the reputation for holding some of the most sought-after events in Atlanta. Amy’s planning usually includes entertainment by classical orchestra groups that create a relaxed atmosphere. One time, Amy departed from the ordinary classical entertainment performance when she was able to book the Eagles for a private, outdoor performance that is still remembered by all those lucky enough to be present.
Amy’s intricate pre-party planning includes flying to New York in their private jet the morning of the event, where she has a standing appointment with one of the country’s most notable hair and makeup artists. Next, she is off to the garment district of New York, where she is fitted with an utterly unique custom-made ensemble before flying back to Atlanta in time to ensure every detail is as planned.
Dan and Amy also take extraordinary pride in the wine selection they offer their guests.

In summary, Dan Green’s story illustrates the transformative power of dreaming big, working hard, being dedicated, and being determined. Dan is at the top of the ladder and the envy of Atlanta.
Chapter Two The Hunt Begins
As Dan sat at his desk in an elegant office in one of Atlanta’s most prestigious skyscrapers, engrossed in his work, a man named Benjamin Williams, age 31, sits at a desk in Mougin, France. Benjamin has been staring intently for many hours in his dimly lit room as data streams down his computer screen. He is on a mission of a different kind. Benjamin was born in Wichita, Kansas, and was reared in an orphanage when both parents died in an unfortunate automobile accident. Benjamin was adept with computers from an early age, often being asked by adults around him to help solve their computer problems. Benjamin was born with a natural inclination for the digital world and a propensity for foreign languages. He is gifted with the ability to pick up almost any language he is exposed to in short order. He graduated from high school as the class valedictorian, but he never even considered college. The digital world was all he needed. As he works feverishly, scanning the dark web, he jumps for joy, shouting,” I found him! The biggest fish in the sea! The very one I’ve been looking for all my life.” Now, I will get rich enough to retire and live the good life where I can’t be found. This is really going to be fun!
Just before their deaths, Benjamin’s parents lost practically all their savings and investments in the stock market crash of 2008. They had invested using the advice of a financial planner associated with the same firm Dan Green is with now, not only depriving Benjamin of any inheritance but the loss of his parents at the same time. This would be “sweet revenge” in Benjamin’s eyes. Dan Green was a perfect scapegoat for all the anger and resentment he had carried with him for all the years since his childhood.
Benjamin’s modus operandi was simple yet effective. He would scour the internet for hours on end, searching for personal information about potential victims, piecing together details from social media profiles, public records, and data breaches. Armed with this knowledge, he would then assume the identity of his chosen victim, exploiting their financial accounts, credit lines, and assets he could easily convert for his own use. After piecing together the life of Dan Green, he grew jealous of Dan’s success and sterling reputation. Benjamin’s revelation soon led him to formulate an intricate plan to ruin Dan financially and wreck his life, including Dan’s marriage, much like he had experienced with the death of his parents.
Benjamin was a seasoned identity thief, skilled in exploiting vulnerabilities. He read every email, examined every bank account, copied passwords, calendar appointments, contact lists, including addresses and phone numbers, and investment accounts. In short, Benjamin knew every detail of Dan’s life, and he was set to spring the trap. The ramifications of his crimes would extend far beyond the confines of his own greed, affecting innocent individuals like Dan and Amy, who were unwittingly caught in the crossfire of his malicious intentions.
As Dan wrapped up his work for the day and prepared to head home, little did he know that his path was about to intersect with that of Benjamin Williams, the identity thief on the prowl for his next victim. Their fates intertwined in a web of deception and danger, setting the stage for a high-stakes showdown to test the limits of trust, resilience, and justice in the digital age.
As the sun set over the bustling cityscape, casting long shadows across the urban landscape, the hunt for a rich identity victim continued unabated. Benjamin Williams was poised to strike, and Dan was unwittingly caught in the crosshairs of a dangerous game of cat and mouse. The stage was set for a thrilling saga of intrigue, betrayal, and redemption, where the lines between perpetrator and prey blurred in a world where trust was a fragile commodity and deception lurked around every corner.
1415
In the next chapter, we delve deeper into the intricate web of deceit and manipulation that defines the world of identity theft, exploring the motivations driving individuals like Benjamin to commit these crimes and the far-reaching impact they have on their victims. Stay tuned as the hunt intensifies and the stakes reach new heights in a gripping tale of crime, consequence, and redemption.
Chapter Three Benjamin’s Plan Is Set in Motion
“Susie, how long will it take you to pack up?” asks Benjamin. Susan replies, “Where are we going? How long do I pack for?” He replies, “Pack everything you have; we’re not coming back here. You remember I told you that in this business, I can’t stay in one place long. It won’t be long before Mr. Mouse gets in touch with American law enforcement, and then, in a few days, we’ll be getting a knock on the door. We must stay one or two steps ahead of them.”
Susan asks,” Is it worth it?” “Worth what?” he replies. “All this moving from one country to another?” “This mouse is so rich, Susie, it’s worth whatever we must do. When I’m through with Mr. Mouse, we’ll be so rich we can retire and buy us a big place anywhere we want. Then we can get lost; they’ll never find me. Most times, the target gets mad at first, and some even try to find me, but I’m too smart for them. After a few weeks, sometimes a few months, they just get tired of it all, accept it, and move on. Remember what I said: always stay one or two steps ahead of them, and I know how to do it.”
“Okay, what part of the world are we going to next?” Susan asks. Benjamin takes a dart off the world map hanging from the bedroom door and hands it to her. “You pick, close your eyes, and throw the dart. Wherever it hits, that will be our new home for a while,” he answers. Susan throws the dart and opens her eyes, “Brazil she shouts and jumps up and down in excitement. I’ve always wanted to go there!”
Benjamin grabs her in mid-air and tosses her onto the bed. “One last thing to do here in France, he quickly begins to undress her. How about a little afternoon delight?” Susan replies, “I thought you’d never ask!
While Dan is going home after an exhausting day at work in the bumper-tobumper traffic jams of the overcrowded Atlanta freeways, Amy has prepared an elegant dinner. As she waits for Dan to arrive, she decides to open her laptop and look on Facebook to catch up on all the Atlanta gossip. Suddenly, she is shocked to see friends posting statements about her husband. They are insinuating Dan is having an affair with a strip tease dancer at a downtown watering hole who goes by the stage name of Miss April Showers. Some posts even appear to have photographs of the two in intimate conversation over an expensive dinner. Amy is devastated. The evidence seems so real and indisputable, but it is difficult for Amy to imagine her beloved husband of more than 20 years, who has always adored her and been faithful, never keeping any secrets from her, being so devious and hurtful. It is as though everyone in Atlanta knows about his infidelity except her. Just then, Amy hears Dan’s Mercedes pulling into the garage, so she hurriedly wipes away her tears and sets dinner on the table as if nothing is wrong.
Dan walks into the dining room, tired but looking forward to a delicious meal with the love of his life, Amy. He reaches out to give her a hug and a quick peck on the lips, but Amy seems distant and cold, pulling away from him. Dan senses something is wrong but has no idea what is happening, so he asks, “Amy, what’s wrong?” She replies, “Don’t play that game with me, you know damn well your secret is the talk of Atlanta. Everybody knew but me. How could you do this to me, Dan?”
Dan asks, “Amy, what in heaven’s name are you talking about?”
She replied, “Don’t pretend you don’t know, here, take a look at these Facebook posts and tell me with a straight face these pictures aren’t you with your little whore?”
Dan replies, “Amy, I don’t know what’s happening here, but that is not me! I’ve loved you since high school, and you know I have never lied to you, and I never will. You must believe me! Who put that trash on Facebook?”
“Some of our closest friends,” she said. “You will admit it sure looks like you, won’t you? I’ve always heard that pictures don’t lie, and that is you. Tell me the truth! Don’t I deserve to hear the truth?”
Dan said, “I am telling you the truth. Yes, it sure looks like me, but I swear I have never cheated on you, and I never will. Just give me a little time, and I’ll discover what’s happening.”
“Hey, it looks like you’ve fixed my favorite meal, so let’s sit down and enjoy our dinner. Tomorrow, when I get to the office, I’ll dig into this. I know there must be some obvious explanation, you know, like a cruel joke or something.”
1617
Amy replied, “You go ahead and eat; I’m not hungry anymore. I’m going to get ready for bed. I want to believe you, Dan. Don’t let me down.”
Chapter Four
Dan Learns He Has a Bigger Problem
Dan leaves home early so he can beat the heavy inbound traffic into Atlanta. He got little sleep the night before since Amy kept her distance from him, sleeping in another bedroom. He knows he must uncover the motivation behind the nasty Facebook posts, and have it stopped, or he might lose Amy. All night, he has racked his brain about who would do such a thing to him and why. He has no clue about how much worse things are about to get for him this day.
Dan pulls into the parking lot of the office building on Peachtree Street, retrieves his briefcase, and takes the elevator to the 25th floor, where his office is located. As soon as he exits the elevator, a worried secretary, Melanie Sumner, comes running to meet him. From the look on her face, Dan knows something is terribly wrong.
Melanie says, “Thank goodness you’re here, Mr. Green! Our phones have been ringing incessantly since I arrived.” Dan asks,” Slow down, Melanie. What’s going on?”
“It seems there are all sorts of rumors going around town about you she said. “Some of your best clients are worried because of another rumor that you have been embezzling client’s accounts to maintain your standard of living. Many have reported you are not answering your cell phone and are not responding to emails either. Even I couldn’t reach you earlier this morning when I tried to call you and give you a heads up.”
Dan said, “Melanie, let me go into my office and start trying to sort out exactly what’s happening. When someone calls asking for me, tell them we don’t know how these unsubstantiated rumors got started, but there is absolutely no truth to any of them. Also, take their names and phone numbers, tell them I am working diligently to find the underlying cause of these rumors, and I will get back to them as soon as I can. Melanie, you have worked side by side, but I have been with you for over 10 years now, and you know what kind of person “Yes, sir, you have always been above reproach with me and all your clients. That is exactly what I will tell them”, she said.
“Okay, now let’s get to work. First, let me try my phone and make sure it’s still working fine like it was yesterday,” he said. Dan tries calling Amy several times, but the line stays silent. “First of all, get my cell phone company on the line for me so I can try and get that problem cleared up. Maybe my carrier is having an outage,” said Dan.
Melanie calls and routes the phone company customer service representative to Dan’s office number. When his phone rings, Dan picks up and explains his problem of not having access to his number. The rep asks if she can put this call on hold for a few minutes while she pulls up his account. She returns to the line and tells Dan their network is working perfectly, and she has found his problem. Dan is totally dumbfounded when the lady tells him his line is no longer working because he called last night and had his number “ported” or routed to another phone carrier. Dan explains that he did not make that call and that someone must have impersonated him. He demands that the company restore his old number with them at once, but the lady explains that is not possible and he needs to contact the other carrier himself and explain what has happened. After several hours of going back and forth with the phone companies, Dan decides he has spent too much time on that problem and needs to move on to the other disasters that are coming in by the minute. Dan quickly looks at the trading floor just outside his office, and he sees all the traders are busy answering calls about the rumors making the rounds in Atlanta concerning Dan and any possible fraud.
I am. You know I would never do any of those things you just heard, right?”

As the day passes, Dan becomes increasingly alarmed at the events unfolding. Instinct tells him he should check on some of his bank and investment accounts. As he pulls up the first personal bank account, he is stunned to see discover $250,000.00 has been withdrawn just that morning alone. He immediately calls the bank and puts them on notice that fraudulent activity is occurring in his account. The bank recommends putting an immediate freeze on the account until further investigation can be done. They also recommend that he file a police report with the Fulton County Sheriff’s Office first and then file a report with the Federal Trade Commission since they are the federal agency tasked with dealing with identity theft.
Chapter Five From Bad to Worse
As the day continues and Dan has not had a break from the stress and tension, he decides to take a quick break, grab a cup of coffee and a doughnut, and take a brisk walk outside to help relieve some of the stress. During his walk through the park near his office, he realizes he has not notified his personal attorney.
Returning to his office, Dan calls Thomas Adams, his personal attorney whom he has used since he began his career. When Thomas answers the call, Dan carefully relates the events taking place and asks for Thomas’s help in dealing with the problem. Thomas assures Dan he will be able to help him. He says he will start the Sheriff’s Department investigation and report the theft to federal authorities so Dan has more time to deal with the problems at hand. Dan thanks his friend and promises to keep him informed as the crisis unfolds.
Soon after returning to his office, Melanie steps in with a worried look on her face as she announces, “Sorry to interrupt Mr. Green, but Mr. Cartwright from the New York office is on line 5 and insists he must talk with you now”. Dan replies, “Thanks Melanie, I wondered how long it would be until New York stepped in, put him through”. James Cartwright is President and Chairman of the New York-based investment firm, “Cartwright, Harding, and Higgs, LLC, one of the largest investment firms in America.
“Dan, what the hell is going on in Atlanta?” he asks. “Everybody is calling and wanting answers. Our clients are worried because they have heard rumors that their accounts have been embezzled. Tell me, why haven’t I heard from you by now”? Dan replies, “I’m sorry, Jim. I intended to fill you in earlier this morning, but I have been busy putting out one fire after another. The short answer is I don’t know what’s going on. Somebody took over my phone number and my email address and has been posting awful things about me on social media. My wife is about to leave me, and suddenly, people think the worst of me. I give you my solemn word that none of it is true! You’ve known me a long time now, does this sound like the Dan Green you know? As for the accusations of embezzling clients’ accounts, I stand on my past impeccable record.” Jim replies, “Dan, I do believe in you, and I take you at your word, but you know what must happen now; since the accusations have been made, I must order a thorough investigation. A team of auditors will be there first thing in the morning to get started. Until we get this thing settled, I am putting you on a temporary leave of absence. If I don’t do it, the Securities Exchange Commission will, and we can’t give the public or the regulators any room for doubt. The audit will clear your name and the firm’s name”. Dan replies, “I know Jim, and that’s what I want. I want my good name restored. I’ve nothing to hide, but I just don’t understand why all of this is happening now”.
Hours later, Melanie knocks on Dan’s door, enters, and informs him that the rest of the staff has left for the day since it is well after normal business hours. This information startled him because he had been so busy all day that he had no perception of time. Melanie says, “Excuse me, Mr. Green, I know you are terribly busy, but I wanted to let you know the staff, and I have been taking calls all day from concerned clients, and we have assured them the rumors circulating are false and without merit. Is there anything else you need me to do before I leave for the day?” Dan replied, “Thank you, Melanie; no, there is nothing more for you to do today. In case I haven’t told you, thanks for your help today. You have been super helpful, and I really appreciate it. I won’t forget it.” Melanie smiles and replies, “You’re welcome, Mr. Green; I’m just doing my job. Now, you need to wrap things up here and head for home yourself. It’s a suitable time to leave because the traffic has thinned out considerably. Good night; I’ll see you in the morning. Oh, there is one thing I almost forgot to tell you: your wife called earlier today, but you were on the phone, so she said to tell you your debit card, as well as your credit cards, were declined when she tried using them today. I’m sorry, Mr. Green; maybe you can get things under control tomorrow.”

Soon after Melanie is gone, Dan’s office number rings. He almost doesn’t answer it since it is an unfamiliar number. Still, he takes the call, and the voice on the line introduces herself as Rebecca Sumner, identity theft investigator for the Fulton County Sheriff’s Department. Rebecca apologizes for the late call but explains she has been contacted by Dan’s attorney and, if possible, would like to come to Dan’s office and start the fraud report now so she can begin her investigation immediately.
Dan is very tired from the long day of trying to find the underlying cause of what is going on, but he agrees and tells her to come over. He’ll let her in after she identifies herself to the guard at the front door.
Thirty minutes later, Dan receives a call from the front desk guard letting him know Rebecca Sumner is on her way up to his floor, so Dan goes to the elevator entrance to meet her. When the door opens, Rebecca, age 29, with blond hair and dazzling blue eyes, steps out and introduces herself to Dan. He is completely caught off guard since he had assumed the investigator would be an older, more rugged police veteran, but he quickly recovers and leads her into his office and invites her to have a seat in front of his desk. Dan offers her something to drink, but she declines and suggests they get on with the interview.
While Dan is relating his experiences, Rebecca meticulously takes notes on an interview pad, which will become a permanent item in Dan’s report. Occasionally, she stops him and asks for further clarification.
Rebecca said, “Thanks, Mr. Green, for your willingness to stay late for the interview. I know you must be exhausted after such a stressful day. This will allow me to dive right into the investigation. The usual scenario is someone will contact you soon by text, phone call, or email to extort more money from you and he is anxious to see if she has calmed down since the night before. He hopes she has realized by now that he would never be unfaithful to her. Now is when he needs her love and support most of all.
When he arrives at the gated entrance to their home, the first thing he notices is that the entire house is dark except for the exterior lighting, which seems odd since Amy always leaves a few lights on inside. Dan pulls into the garage and has an eerie feeling something is not right. Amy always leaves the garage light on since he often works late. She also leaves a note on the table telling him she has placed a meal for him in the oven.
in exchange for something valuable. If that happens, let me know at once, day or night. Here’s my card so you will know how to reach me anytime.” Dan replied, “I appreciate you taking such an interest. So much is happening all at once, and for the first time in my life, I feel lost and alone, unsure of what I should do next. Whoever is responsible for this is an evil person. We must stop them, or they will ruin my life and then move on to other victims.” “Just doing my Job”, she said.
Dan Said, “I can tell you take your job seriously. I feel a little better knowing you are on the case. I am exhausted, and on my way home for the night, may I escort you down and to your car?”
“That’s not necessary, but sure, since we are going to the same place, I would be delighted to have someone accompany me,” she replied. Dan and Rebecca silently took the elevator to the first floor, where they both checked out of the building and continued to their automobiles.
The time is 12:30 AM the following day as Dan easily drives through the empty Atlanta streets and hops onto the downtown connector for a quick trip home. He has tried calling Amy all day from his office phone with no success,

As he cautiously makes his way to the kitchen, he is relieved to see a note on the table, and he reaches for it to pick it up. The note is from Amy and is attached to a photograph. The note is from Amy, and it reads, “My darling Dan, I fell in love with you at first sight, and that love has only grown stronger through the years. I always thought you loved me the same way, but I guess I was wrong. I found this picture in our mailbox today, and it seems to explain everything. I have packed a few belongings and will be staying with my mother over at Lake Oconee until I sort everything out. Please don’t try to contact me. I will let you know when I decide how to move forward.”

Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids
422 ratings","Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids by Jemima Paul and Arvind Paul is a children’s book meant to inspire the younger minds of Christian children. It is about a family constantly indulging in prayers and reading the Bible. The parents of eight-year-old Emma and six-year-old Bella have always taught them about God, His love for His children, and how they should love Him back. The story is predominantly about Emma, who dreams about heaven and God. She excitedly shares the vivid details of what heaven is like, how God looks over His people, and how it is the most stunning place she has ever seen. I like how the story unfolds as Emma shares her dreams. The extraordinary scenes in heaven match the descriptions in the Bible. It must have been incredible for her to see the people she had only heard about from the Bible stories, to experience the exquisite nature, and how all the creatures lived together in harmony. The illustrations will fascinate a young child. It will provide an empty canvas for the readers to unleash their imaginative creativity. I was slightly displeased with the depiction of hell in the story. Since it is a book for children, the authors should have been gentler. Yes, indeed, children should be taught to do the right thing. However, they should do it because it is right and not out of fear of going to hell. That was the only thing I disliked, but that did not affect my opinion of this book. Because I did not find any errors, I can say the book was exceptionally well-edited. Excluding the dissatisfaction mentioned earlier, I found no concerns with the book. Hence, I rate this book 5 out of 5 stars. This book intends to convey to children a sense of what Christianity means. It answers questions about Jesus and how to grow in faith. I recommend this book to parents who want their children to know more about God."

422 ratings","Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids by Jemima Paul and Arvind Paul is a biblical resource for parents who want to raise morally upright children. Emma and Bella share a small house with their parents and baby sister. Emma is eight years old, and Bella is six. They have everything they need as children, including clothes, food, and toys to play with. And their parents adore them. Emma and Bella's parents teach them about God, how much he loves them, and how important it is for them to reciprocate that love. Before bed, they pray together, and their parent reads the Bible to them. One day, Emma had a dream about God and what heaven would be like. The following day, she appeared ecstatic and eager to share her dream with her sister and parents. Emma told her family about her dream, and everyone sat down to hear her explain it because they were all interested. This book appeals to me because it is instructive and beneficial to kids. Despite being young, Emma's ability to clearly describe her dreams impressed me. I like how much love and care Emma's parents showed their kids; this is a behavior that parents should emulate. Emma was blessed to have these experiences when she was young, and sharing the dream with her family is commendable. It's good that Emma instilled in her the value of prayer at a young age, and her description of heaven was lovely. I had no reason to dislike this book, and I rated it 5 out of 5 stars. I didn't encounter any errors while reading this book, which shows that Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids by Jemima Paul and Arvind Paul was exceptionally well edited.

422 ratings","Have you ever dreamt about going to heaven and seeing how beautiful it is? Have you also ever dreamt about going to hell and seeing all the dreadful things that happen there? Well, if you haven't, then join me in reading about a girl who dreamt about seeing both heaven and hell. In the book Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids by Jemima Paul and Arvind Paul, Emma dreams that she and her sister go to heaven. They meet God the Father, Jesus, and angels, among others. Many people have always tried to imagine what heaven looks like, and it has been described as a land that flows with milk and honey. It also has golden castles, and people in heaven do not know suffering. One of the things I appreciate about this book is how it conveyed the difficult topic of heaven to children. The authors explained what is in heaven in a simple and engaging way that will capture the attention of children. The illustrations in the book are also worth mentioning. These illustrations complement the text perfectly and bring the story to life, thus making it more visually appealing. Moreover, children will enjoy looking at the illustrations and have an idea of what heaven is like. I also liked that the Bible was used as a reference throughout the book. The Bible is the holy book for Christians, and it describes heaven. What is said about heaven is similar to what is said about it in this book. This means that the two girls are being brought up in a Christian family, and very few families nowadays actually raise their children this way. This book might, therefore, be an inspiration to parents to also raise their children in a Christian way. There is nothing I disliked about this book, so I rate it 5 out of 5 stars. The book also seems to have been well-edited since I encountered no errors while reading it. I recommend this book to children and parents who want to tell their children about heaven."

She describes the streets paved with gold, Jesus welcoming everyone, angels dressed in white, and an abundance of beautiful plants, trees, and animals.

It was enough to show that Hell is a bad place without going into any details that may be above a younger audience.

Emma and Bella are two little girls who live with their parents and have a loving relationship with them. They also have a baby sister, and the two girls get to learn a lot from their parents about God. Emma has amazing dreams where she sees and knows more about heaven, and she doesn't go through this beautiful experience alone; she also goes through it with her sister. As she shares these dreams with her parents, she finds out if both she and Bella will learn more about God and aspire to do his work. Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids by Jemima Paul, Arvind Paul is an incredible book that shares what Christianity is all about. One thing I would say that I liked about this book is that it shares the word of God in a way that both adults and children would understand. The visual illustration of the dreams Emma had made the book even more beautiful to read. I also loved the inclusion of Bible verses in the book, and I loved the fact that the characters were able to interpret all of these Bible verses understandably. There was absolutely nothing that I disliked about this book because it shared so much of God's word with the little ones and the importance of reading the Bible. I also liked that the characters asked questions about these interpretations because these were lingering questions that hovered over one's mind while reading it. The book was exceptionally well-edited, and I would rate it 5 out of 5 stars because of how simple and understandable it was. I would recommend this book to children, as I feel they would learn a lot about Jesus and the love he has for all of us. I would also recommend it to those who seem to experience difficulty in the interpretation of their dreams."

Emma and her six-year-old sister, Bella, are two little girls who are loved dearly by their parents. Mommy and Daddy teach the girls about God and how much He loves them. Each night, they read the Bible together and pray with them before bed. One morning, Emma woke up very excited after dreaming that she and Bella had visited heaven. She couldn't wait to share it with her family. Bella is thrilled that she was part of the dream, too. Emma prays to God, asking Him to let her dream about visiting heaven again. Will He answer her prayers? What did she see and do in heaven? I'm sure children will want to know what Emma experienced. This book is a wonderful way to introduce children to God's love, mercy, and forgiveness. It talks about the reward of heaven for those who seek forgiveness and ask Jesus into their hearts. I appreciate that it also addresses the consequences of not living according to God's will. It is obvious that the authors are in tune with their younger audience because the language is simple and appropriate, making it easy for younger readers to understand. The quality of the illustrations is delightful. They are colorful, vivid, and fitting for the narrative. This story is intriguing and would entice children to learn more about God and what the Bible teaches about salvation and telling others about Jesus. There was nothing I disliked about this book. I didn't find any errors due to the exceptional editing. I enthusiastically rate this book 5 out of 5 stars, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to parents and grandparents of elementary-aged children."

Emma has a dream, and in that dream, she and Bella are brought up to heaven by angels. While she’s there, she sees all sorts of things, like a rainbow, a golden road, and so much more. Emma soon learns that all these things are supported by scripture. She meets Jesus and learns about God’s love. Then Emma is shown hell and sees the fire and torment of those in hell. She sees Satan and his demons. Her parents tell her about the need to share the word of God with those around her, so she does. Despite this book being geared toward children, I really enjoyed it. I liked that it was easy to read and understand, and I also liked that it helps kids grow closer to their faith. I felt that aspect was done really well. I also like that they had the passages of the quotes at the bottom instead of the story so that kids don’t have to read that as part of the story. As a result, the story flows better than if they quoted the verse every other sentence. I also liked the illustrations and how they helped you visualize the scene. I loved everything about this book, there was nothing I would change. There were no spelling or grammatical errors, and I enjoyed the book. I rate Snatched up to Heaven for Kids, by Jemimia and Arvind Paul, 5 out of 5 stars. I felt the book was put together in an easy way, both for kids to understand, and also to read, despite the difficult subject of hell. I would recommend this book to Christian families who want to help their kids grow in their faith.

In this story, eight-year-old Emma has dreams where she and her younger sister Bella get to visit Heaven and Hell led by Jesus. Emma excitedly shares her adventures with her sister, her mother and her father who listen with keen interest. Her parents refer to the Bible to confirm Emma's accounts of both Heaven and Hell. As you would imagine, such dreams bring about many questions for the two young girls. Questions that their parents can answer using their Bible. Emma's enthusiasm while recounting her dream adventures is sweet. Her little sister's innocence is adorable. Her parents do a fine job of interpreting her dreams and sharing their thoughts with their girls. Anyone planning on reading the story to very young children might want to read it first as it does reference Hell and goes into some detail describing it and the people there. It is also important to note that the message for parents is one of repentance and even suggests that 'God's patience will eventually run out'. The book uses references from the Bible throughout. It is a story for Christians and doesn't allow for any other belief systems or ideas. The illustrations are beautiful and complement the story perfectly. It is a short read and can be read in one sitting. Perfect as a bedtime story or just an excuse to sit and connect with a loved one.

They listen carefully and excitingly, asking her questions and trying to understand everything. In her dreams, Emma and her sister Bella are taken from bed to visit heaven.

422 ratings","This was a wonderful book for reading to young children to teach them about heaven and even, a little bit about hell. The accompanying pictures were bright and colorful; very attractive for children. I would read this book to either boys or girls, anywhere from 4 years old to around 9 years old. It was eye catching. It would be a great way to introduce children to the concept of heaven and hell in a manner that is not too scary. It is biblically sound with scripture references through out the story; another way to further engage children by getting into the Bible and the Word as a family. Having references reinforces the truth of God’s Word. This book was written to where a young elementary child could read it on his or her own and come to their parents with further questions and/or to read further on the scriptures. Or a family could simply make this book a part of their family time learning. It would also be beneficial to include in church Sunday school rooms or young youth groups as just another way to further their knowledge of the kingdom of God, from another teacher or along with their peers. I read this to my 6 year old and she really enjoyed the drawings alongside the story. It gave our family a good evening of discussion about heaven and what heaven will look like. We certainly appreciated having scripture to look up and then we were able to keep going through the bible and learn about even more than what we started out to do and that’s an amazing feeling, to foster the love of God in our child and even in ourselves; over a topic that we do not often study or go into detail with with our children."

It's a story about how a little girl dreams of heaven , all its beautiful roads , gardens and the Angels, she even dreams of visiting hell with Jesus so that she can getvthe answer to her question on if heaven and hellis real.

I will give this book a 5 out of 5 because it gives a clear indication that children are very important in the world as it is them who we need to teach about God. Our children are the way because you need to be humble like a child to get into heaven. It tells a person that we can learn for children what is important in the eyes of the lord. This book teaches you about value and morals in life. Emma is a little girl that dreams every night about going to heaven and seeing all the wonders. She wakes up each time after a dream and tells her parents about it. We learn from the book that she is only dreaming as her parents read to her and her sister every night from the Bible and then pray together. She then takes what she just heard and dreams about it, it's as if she sees a movie in her sleep about what her parents just read to her and her sister."

It is explained in such detail with distinctive pictures that it makes it so much better for kids. She has had numerous dreams of heaven, and she even dreams of hell. The story is about two sisters and their guardians having every day Book of Scriptures readings, prayer, and examining Emma's dreams of going to heaven. I cherish the guardians who talk with and answer the girls' questions about Jesus. Their illustration to readers about investing valuable time together and talking about almost the most critical thing in the world is perfect. I can tell in the event that this can be a genuine story as a genuine girl's repeating dreams, or in case the dreams were fictional, but I have had prophetic dreams myself and accept unequivocally that the Master still uses dreams to talk to His children in some cases. It shows kids that Jesus has a plan for everyone. Generally, the book is delightfully composed. I read the Book of Scriptures to my 7-year-old child each day as well, and I pray with them. I expect her to be exceptionally energized, needing to see and listen to Jesus in their dreams as well. Heaven is their greatest trust, and I'm looking forward to perusing this book with her. I believe the book is good for everyone of the Christian faith. I have found no errors in the book, and I rate it 5 out of 5. Keep writing and showing your faith to children."

And it definitely needs to be well written and thoroughly edited. When finding a book to read, I look at the cover of the book first. If the cover catches my eye, then I read the description. This book fit the description perfectly. And the cover illustration is definitely an eye catcher. The book “Snatched Up To Heaven” is a very good book. I’d give it a 5 out of 5 rating. When I began reading, I had a checklist in my head for grammar errors, sexual content and profanity. Typically, you’d find multiple of the above mentioned in any book, but not this one. As I neared the middle and end of the book, I found none. This is a very well written and thoroughly edited book. It’s very rare to find a book with no errors. But this book passes every test. If you’re looking for a short but sweet book for your children, you found it. This book is a perfect choice, from the creative illustrations to the descriptive words. I actually work with kids on a daily basis, and I like having books available for them. If I had to choose between this book and a pile of others, there’s a good chance I’d pick up this book. Not only did I enjoy it, and smile while reading it, but I’m sure the kids I work with would love it. I fully recommend that you give this book a shot.

The parents take seriously their role as the primary educators in the faith formation of their children. Every major religion has factions, and that includes Christianity. There are the traditionalists, the progressives, and the ones in between. It is worth mentioning that some Christians may not agree with the authors’ interpretation of certain Bible passages quoted in the book. This is by no means the fault of the authors. I for one do not find anything disagreeable or offensive in the book. Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids deserves a 5 out of 5 stars. There are no spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors, and the wording is done beautifully. The story progresses smoothly and coherently. The magnificent artwork is eye catching, inviting, and endearing. It is obvious that the book was professionally edited. The book is geared towards elementary children who are Christians. It is a good bedtime story for parents to tell, but it can also be used for Sunday school instructions by teachers. Although the subject of Heaven is one of profound depth and breadth, the authors are able to explain it in a manner that children will understand without watering anything down."

422 ratings","Snatched up to heaven for kids is a heart-warming Christian storybook by Jemima Paul and Arvind Paul. The authors narration style is engaging and it makes one want to finish reading the entire book at one go. The authors used simple grammer alongside colourful illustrations which makes it a good read for children above the age of four years old. The story is about a Christian family of four-Father, mother and two daughters, Emma and Bella. It was a daily nightly routine for the parents to read the Bible to the two girls and pray. One night, Emma had a dream of going to heaven with Bella and meeting Jesus who showed them what heaven is really like. Emma gets a glimpse of heaven in her dreams every night and her excited narration to her family about her adventures is fascinating to say the least. The curiosity of little children about heaven and hell is well projected when the children asks questions and the parents provide them with answers. I love that the authors provided relevant Bible verses that go hand in hand with the storyline. This endearing book shows the love and bond between the sisters and their parents while simultaneously instilling the virtues of faith, hope and love that comes through the salvation Jesus Christ. As a parent of small children, I would highly recommend this book to other parents who want to inculcate the teachings about heaven and hell to their children in a light hearted way. This beautiful book encourages children to obey God and do right by Him. It teaches them about the consequences of their deeds and choices in an entertaining and thought-provoking manner. I give this wonderful book a rating of 5 out of 5 not only because of its simple writing style but also because of the storyline which makes it an intriguing book not just for children but adults as well. I found no errors in the book."

It is, without doubt, one of the most easy read and educative books I’ve recently read on Christianity. And with the awareness of more kids growing up in a hard world, full of possibility to make the wrong decision, it’s a priority for all parents, teachers, and anyone who’s in charge of teaching kids how to behave in this world, it is mandatory to find a way to show children, since a young age what happens if you believe in Jesus and what could happen if you don’t act how you are supposed to. The message shared is of significant importance, and it's presented to children in a way that is easy for them to comprehend through the dreams of a little girl. This writing reveals the 'good' and the 'bad' and outlines the necessary measures to take in order to achieve a place in heaven. In addition, the illustrations are incredibly accurate and incredibly impressive. Both adults and children alike will be captivated and compelled by what they encounter in the illustrations. Those pages brought the dreams to life in such a stunning way that I just fell in love with them, and I am sure others will too. I would certainly like to purchase a copy of this item for different family members who have young children and need a little help in explaining why it is important to listen and read the messages shared in the Bible. Without a doubt, this book is worthy of the highest rating 5 out of 5, your time, and your children’s time, and I highly recommend that you buy it so you can share it with your friends and family."

422 ratings","This is a book that touches the souls of children and adults who believe in God and his greatness! The heroes of the book refer to and explain the position and nature of God in simple and comprehensible vocabulary, both for adults and for small children. It is a book that does not cause fear or questions, but only a happy mood and, perhaps, a security for the fact that there is a higher power that protects and forgives. It is easy to read, the plot progresses smoothly, it has some elements of small suspense for the continuity and it is not boring at all. The reader is drawn in and cannot let go of it until the end. Ideally, I would like there to be a second part that explains and describes what the heroines did after they grew up and how they applied the principles of the Bible in their lives, finally. I believe that similar children's books dealing with religious content are lacking in variety and it would be nice to publish more that refer to different religions with simple vocabulary and clear concepts. Regarding the rating, it is 4 out of 4- excellent, amazing and 5 out of 5- amazing; one of the best books ever."

422 ratings","Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids is about a young girl named Emma who, being educated by her parents about God and Jesus, begins to have dreams of visiting heaven and hell. Her parents listen to these dreams, help explain them, and support these explanations with Bible verses. I thought this book was well-written and suitable for young children. I especially liked the parts when Emma explained the dreams; her parents reinforced what she said as being correct, looked up Bible verses to support what they said, and read them to her. There were many beautiful illustrations, and footnotes to indicate where the verses could be located in the Bible. Although this book was written for children, I found it to be entertaining for adults as well. For example, the story was very detailed about what Heaven looks like, who could be met there, and believable as being described from a young girl's perspective. While reading about Emma's encounters, I was able to imagine how my own visit might be. The length of the book is reasonable enough to flesh out the story but not too long that it would lose a child's attention. I rate Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids a 5 out of 5, for how detailed the descriptions were, and because there were no grammatical errors. I also think it is very important to teach our children about faith as early as they can grasp it. I caution that in a portion of the story where Emma also visits hell and is scared by it, although that allows her to understand the importance of saving others from hell, it may be too much for a very young child to hear and understand. I did not rate down for this because I felt it was an important part of the character's learning process of how heaven and hell both work and how we should help others to understand."

I did not witness any grammatical or spelling errors anywhere. Well done on the editing and illustrations! As a believer of Jesus and His place in heaven and on earth, this book was a helpful tool in providing answers to a child's question about heaven, God, hell, and Jesus. The book was great because it provided Bible verses to talk about and answer questions about who were in heaven, what they do everyday, what they wear, what they eat, etc... This book is a must buy for those new believers, but also for children who want to learn more about heaven. The very question of, is heaven and hell for real, are answered in this book. The idea that both places are very real can be a scary thought, but the way this book broke the truth down, made it palatable because it was taught from a child's perspective. The faith of a child doesn't make things like heaven and hell complicated. Out of the ratings, I would give this book a 4 out of 5. It's not the very best book I have ever read; however, it is a book I wished that I had when I was a child starting out on my Christian journey."

422 ratings","Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids is a very interesting book. It is very simple to read. The language used is that which kids will enjoy reading eating. While reading, I imagined myself reading it for my kids. That dialogue between Emma, Bella, Mommy and Daddy is one which every parent will enjoy reading to their kids. The change of voices is an interesting part of parents reading for their kids. The suspense also applied in the book will make the kids awake, wanting to hear what happens after that. In my mind, I found myself thinking exactly like that, 'what happens after Emma has been taken up again the next night. The interesting ending of the book gives it a good balance. The other side of the dream and the hope that the parents give. A very good pattern is laid by the parents of spending time with their kids in the word and explaining to them all that they need to know about the matters of Christian life and expounding to them all that is in the scriptures that Emma Experiences. Daddy is always available to spiritually direct the children and answer satisfy their curiosity. That is an excellent work done. However, the only thing I have is that the book seemed to favor Emma over Bella. She was the one who had dreams while the other one didn't have. Apart from that, there was a healthy balance between the experiences of the two in the dream and I thought that was great. I must say that the editing was excellent. The use of pictorial illustration also encourages one to continue reading. It has a simple way of bringing the Gospel to kids and showing them what is required of them. Yes, there are joys and there are agonies after life and that message is clearly send to the mind of every reader, whether kids or grownups. It is a book that you should plan to read with your kids."

422 ratings","As a Christian mom of young children and a primary teacher, I found this book to be a beautifully simplistic explanation of Heaven and Hell. Told from a child’s point of view, this book will excite readers of all ages! I rated this book 5 out of 5 stars because it is captivating and can hold the attention of its youngest and oldest readers. It follows the dreams of a young girl as she shares them with her parents and sisters each morning. She describes each dream by detailing the people and things she encounters in Heaven. Her parents and middle sister engage her in wonderful conversations about her dreams, asking questions and reading verses from the Bible that confirm the accuracy of her dreams. This book is well-written, well-illustrated, and flawlessly edited. I followed the book with joyful anticipation until coming to an illustration that quickly changed the course of the story and set a foreboding tone. This transition from describing Heaven to describing Hell really caught me off guard. It is a topic not often covered in Christian children’s books and can be scary for young readers. For parents looking for a way to describe Heaven and Hell, though, this book does it in a direct and Biblical way that can lead to great discussions! As an educator, the thing that I loved the most about this book were the citations of scripture throughout the story. It is a great opportunity to teach older children how to look up these verses and connect them to what they’ve read. I highly recommend this book to all Christian parents. Read it on your own first and prepare yourself for the questions that will likely come from your young reader."

I enjoyed the illustrations of the family and the different settings of the story. The illustrations are very colourful and easy to understand. It is educational as almost each page there would be verses from the Bible. It is a nice introduction to Heaven with a page or 2 about Hell. It is perfect for Christian families who want to spend time with their children, helping them understand their religion.

The author has also included footnotes of each verse that were being used on each page. The author has also included a small message for parents as well, which is thoughtful. The story itself was very easy to understand, with no difficult words. It was nice to see that each ‘chapter’ was somewhat connected but was also separated at the same time. Each section of the story has a hidden message. Which is nice way to help parents bond with their child, by asking what the hidden message is. I would rate the book 4 out of 4. Though, I would say that it would be nice to include other genders and not just have 2 girls, as I find that it might not be inclusive to other children. As the only male figure would be the dad. I would say that it is not for a bedtime read, as Hell is described with enough vivid details along with the illustrations, which some children might find unpleasant. Overall, the story was a nice read with illustrations on what Heaven and Hell is and soft introduction to the religion. But would not read for a bedtime story. For this reason I would rate the story 4 out of 5."

422 ratings","""Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids"" was my first Christian children's book, and I must honestly say that it surprised me how wonderful this religion is.What I liked most about this book was that it had a childlike, friendly writing style, and there were lots of beautiful, colorful pictures to illustrate it. The general plot was very well written, and you learned a lot about God and the world. What I liked best was that exact words from the Bible were used. I am not a believer myself, but this children's book has changed my view of the world a bit. It showed me that we have to take responsibility for our own actions. This book taught me a lot and was very enlightening and exciting at the same time. I also think that the pictures used in the book express a lot of the written words, and as the biographies of the two authors show, they all put their hearts into this book. You could literally tell that they knew what they were writing, and I liked that the most. I give this book four out of five points in terms of rating. I thought it was excellent, and I definitely recommend it. It is also well written, and as a non-religious person, I think more people should read it. But unfortunately, I didn't like the open ending. You don't know if Emma will continue to dream of heaven or if her sister will be able to see it later. It's also very unrealistic that she dreams exactly what her parents read to her, because that's what happens when you dream—you process new information. Nevertheless, you can clearly see the connection that the children have with their parents to God and that he is important to them. There was also the feeling of a lot of family and love, which is an important factor for me. a book that you should definitely read to your children, but also as an adult."

In six chapters, Emma explores the concepts of heaven, hell, and the Christian belief in her dreams in a child-appropriate way. In the first four chapters, Emma visits heaven in her dreams. When she wakes up the story unfolds in conversation with her parents and sister Bella. Questions about what heaven looks like, who will be there, and what you do in heaven are being explored and answered. The answers paint colorful pictures to the reader and are based on the Bible. Chapter Five describes the place of hell in a kid-friendly manner but might still be scary to younger children. Emma's father matches everything Emma describes from her visit to heaven and hell with bible passages he or someone else in the family recites from an unstated Bible translation. The last chapter describes how Emma is feeling after her exploration and coming up with an action plan for her to talk to others about heaven, hell, and the Christian faith. The book ends with chapter Seven, which is a note to parents from the authors. I rate this book five out of five stars. It is easy to read for parents and easy to understand for children. The flawless editing stands out. It can be read as a nighttime story for children ages 5 and up. The story answers general questions about heaven and hell in a way children can understand. It explains the concept and belief of Christianity to children. It supports parents talking to their children about these concepts and it helps children talk about their faith to others. The bright drawings that are appealing to children and adults alike, go well with the story and make the book complete."

The story throws light on the concepts of heaven and hell through the dreams of an innocent child, who habitually listens to her parents read the Bible before she goes to bed. The story shows how keen, imaginative, compassionate and observant kids are at a younger age and how parents can use this curiosity, empathy and eagerness in kids to positively mould them into being humble, loving, caring and God-fearing human beings. It also shows how a little encouragement and understanding from parents can help develop their children's imagination and creativity, and help them find fun and easier ways to learn life lessons.

It is from the perspective of an eight-year-old child, which makes it relatable to a younger audience.

The writing is easy to read and well-edited. A young child would be able to read and comprehend the story. I like how the themes of family and the Bible are consistent throughout the book. Each character plays an active part that shows a supportive and loving family. There are Bible references embedded to accompany the things the little girl describes in her dreams. The book is immersive in how the main character recollects Heaven and Hell in the dream. It truly is like how a child would get excited to share their own experiences. It is well structured in showing the different aspects of heaven and hell. However, it became too systemic when it came to listing the various features at a fast pace. It became evident when the pace slowed down in the chapter on Hell. I would say that is the most immersive section because it injects the fear the character feels into the reader. At this point, the reader could feel what the It made me realise that even Emma was excited to visit Heaven, the pace doesn’t slow down for the reader to enjoy and share in her excitement.

It clearly shows a family whose parents want their kids to be brought up in the “right way” following the faith they believe in. The language was written in simple terms making it easy to understand for children of readable age and particularly I find the use of images a great tool to appeal to kids who are first moved by sight. The Author did well to convey the message in simple words which is remarkable. The Author uses the little child’s eyes; Emma to tell her story and quite interestingly how every answer given was backed up with follow up verses from the Bible, teaching the children truth and how they can refer to a reference book instead of having doubts and here it was the “Bible” However, in my opinion the stories from the little girl’s dreams had too much information & details to it making it quite unrealistic to believe. Also the only fault I noticed on grammatical error was from the chapter titled “Emma has lots of fun” particularly from line six (6) Which read ""The very next night, I dreamed about heaven”. The word “dreamed” was used instead of “dreamt”. I couldn’t tell if it was a deliberate use of grammatical error from the Author seeing that it was the little girl “Emma” who said it and might be unaware of the right tense. In all, the book was an interesting one, easy to understand, educative and I would recommend this for children, adults who fancy this kind of books and for Christians or those who want to know more about “Heaven & Hell”."

422 ratings",I greatly appreciate the care that author Jemima Paul put in to aligning her two young daughter’s dreams to scriptures in the Bible that describe heaven. It grabbed Jemima’s interest when both girls claimed to dream about heaven and mysteriously the details each shared overlapped. It appeared that they shared the same exact dreams. Jemima took this as a sign that what they dreamed of was meant to shared. She documented their experiences with pictures and videos then set out to share them through a book. I rated this book a 4 out of 5 stars due to the fact that Jemima did not provide an opportunity for one to read straight through the fascinating trip to heaven but immediately dove in to the dreams by separating them into categories and sharing pieces of the visions and then giving her analysis and scriptures that also have similar reports of that category such as heaven or hell. This book is great for any Christian who wishes to strengthen their faith. It’s a great book to share with someone who has questions about heaven and hell.

It discussed real hard topics about Christianity and what it means to be Christian. It does so in an informative, fun and understandable way. It does not leave you questioning what was meant as the writing is clear, especially for a children’s book. The illustrations are colorful and bright. They maintain the story line. The illustrations add lots of value as one can imagine just what the author is saying. It is perfect for children as it is easy to see and visualize. Another thing I loved and I think what stood out the most to me were the Bible verses and where to find them. This is an excellent addition especially for those new parents who are not versed in the Bible but are willing to learn and teach there children. The book provides easy pointers of where in the Bible you can find the particular verse to elaborate on it both for the benefit of the child / children and parents. While reading this book I did not encounter any errors, which shows that time was taken to edit it to perfection. All in all this was a delightful read I throughly enjoyed it and I am extremely happy to see children books geared towards religion and religious teachings. I have nothing negative to say regarding this book. I believe the author set out and delivered exactly what she wanted to. It really is a delightful read. I score the book a 5 out of 5"

Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids
422 ratings","“Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids” is a Christian book that introduces the reality of heaven and hell in a way children can easily relate to. It awakens the imagination and paints an image of the beauties of Heaven and the horrors of hell. It’s interesting because it’s not just an adult telling kids a story. The book is narrated from a child’s point of view- a little child having a series of dreams about what Heaven is like. I particularly liked the fact that details from Emma’s dreams were linked back to the Bible with Bible references to support her revelations. It gives the reader a nudge to read the Bible to expose themselves to even more realities hidden in the Holy Book. There’s also a lesson on intentional Christian parenting, which I found interesting. The graphical representations are perfectly related to the story which provides young readers with images etched in their mind palace for them to reference and think about anytime. I imagine how exciting that will be for kids who read this book. The story is very progressive with new details in each dream but I thought it got a bit over the top at some point. On the other hand, it’s a book for kids and the extra details may be necessary to keep their imagination alive. The book is properly edited with very minimal typographical errors. I rate the book five out of five stars. Though some of the details of the story were a bit speculative it’s not enough reason to deduct any stars. Perhaps the writer needed to encapsulate the minds of the young readers so, as I mentioned earlier, it is not a problem because it may help the imagination of the reader to picture themselves in heaven. This is not just any Children’s book so I recommend it to Christian parents and children as there’s a lesson in there for everyone."

I would recommend this book to anyone out there. The pictures are well colors and have great details. The wording is very easy to read and understand. The cover is very well detailed as well. The author make great points to get the message across. There was no grammar errors and everything came out just right. The lighting on the pages was just right and so was the darkness for the hell part of the story. It was amazing to read that the angels came down and took the girls out from their beds in the dream just to show them how peaceful heaven can be. Then Jesus showing them what hell was like and why you should avoid it. To see that there is still many things to do in heaven but its not hard work it is easier than what we are going through down here on earth.

The main character here is one of the children,the little Emma who after repeated habit of listening to God's word, through her parents, had a dream of going up to heaven.This is because she had developed an inner need and more desire to know much about God.Because human mind is liken into a computer,thus whatever we feed in is what we give out. So the little girl dreamt of having met Jesus in her adorning apparel and just liked how heaven was, even felt the joy therein.She said that in her, dream her sister had some stomachaches but when they got there everything was okay.The parents related the dream to some bible verses and it's actually what's is spoken. I would like to appreciate the artwork of this book,it's readable and personally I enjoyed it.The language used is simple and easy to understand.So I find nothing to dislike of the book. I rate it 4 out of 4 since I find no justifiable reasons of why not to do so.

422 ratings","Child training is beautifully expressed in this short and beautiful novel ""Snatched up to Heaven for Kids"". The author brilliantly highlights a unique aspect of Emma's and her sister's moral training through a dream. How Emma has a dream in which she visits a palace where everything looks golden. It even informs about the fruits and vegetables that grow on the trees. And she tells all this sight to her parents. That she meets Jesus. She sees in a dream how she plays with Jesus and also informs about his characteristics. For example, it also describes about their height and the reason of their face. And the most important work that has been enhanced by adding images along with the characters of the story. Because children learn more from pictures than from words. The image of Jesus playing with children reflects a very high level of thinking about how Jesus will live in heaven with the children of his nation. They are very happy to see the children of their community playing with them. On this, Emma's mother convinces her that in heaven everyone will live like the children of kings. There will be no poor. When she tells all this, her father is looking for something from the Bible, then he finds how the Bible says about Noah. He also meets Noah who built the ark. was And in the end, she also sees hell in her dreams. Which creates a sense of difference between good and evil. I think it would be a good masterpiece for children's training if read in front of them."

422 ratings","Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids by Jemima Paul and Arvind Paul, is a lovely short new book designed with young Christian children in mind. Although written and published by her devoted parents, the main storyteller in this little book is a young, creative girl. It is very fascinating to hear her stories about God, Jesus, Heaven, and Hell. This book can help bring up difficult subjects in a healthy and friendly way, with stories that young children will easily comprehend. With nice bright and bold colours, the beautiful illustrations used complement the story on the nearby pages quite nicely. This children's book is a decent length of 31 pages, and would be a great addition to all Christian children's bookshelves. Although this story is ideally read by a parent and discussed, it is so simply written that most children capable of reading would not struggle to read and understand the messages within this book. Without any spelling errors, this is an almost flawlessly written piece. The author does drop consistency with the capital lettering (or lack of) for a few different words throughout the book, although it does not impact reading. With a very modest price, this book is a definite recommend for any young family who would like to explore their religious beliefs more and discuss them with their young children. After reading this children's version and the more in-depth version, I must commend Jemima Paul and Arvind Paul on their dedication to not only their faith but also their children's. I will be purchasing a copy of this children's book for my own little ones. I rate this lovely book a complete 5/5 and recommend it to all young Christian readers and parents. The Bible teaches us to spread His word, and this book beautifully encourages young children to learn more about their faith, as the children in the book have done."

Sometimes we forget that life is too short. Everything here one earth including us is here only for a short amount period of time. Everyone has a final destination and that is Heaven and Hell. The generation we are currently living right now is full of dreadful things that one needs to see what is the most important thing. When one is too caught up with themselves and all their problems we just can't see how one should live one's life. Sometimes all you need is a children's book to help you get out of your head. Also some children's book has much more depth and more things to teach us. I would definitely want more people not only children but also adults to read this book and get the author's message.

Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids by Jemima Paul and Arvind Paul is a book of learning, kindness, values, faith towards the Almighty, and so much more. It is a small story of 35 pages but with important lessons to learn from. The story explores the beauty of heaven as well as God and Jesus. It also warns us about the consequences we might have to experience if we end up in hell. It's a children's book; hence, the authors were careful and responsible enough not to include any gory scenes, which I really appreciate. The book is full of beautiful illustrations of heaven. It also contains a single illustration of hell, of course, not so horrifying that it would scare the children. The book clearly explains the glory of God in simple language and encourages us to be good, do good, and follow the righteous path to obtain eternal happiness. It shares the learnings from the Bible in simple terms through eight and six-year-old kids, making it easier for the little ones to follow and understand the story. The book does not contain any foul or abusive language. The book is well-edited, as I didn't find any typos. The story is short yet concise. The book rightfully deserves 5 out of 5 stars.

422 ratings","I grew up in a Christian home. That means I've heard narrations and ideas of Heaven's appearance. I've often tried to build castles and get the right image of what that fantastic place would feel like, and I always fall short. Having to experience that in a dream would be momentous for me. In the book Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids, Jemima Paul and Arvind Paul narrate their daughter Emma's dreams about Heaven. The book describes Emma's family, a basic family of mom, dad, and two daughters. Emma, one night has a dream about God in her dreams and cannot wait to inform her family about it. In the morning, she gives them all the details. This then becomes a routine. Given her parent's efforts to teach them about the Bible, Emma continues to have these dreams and narrate them to her parents. She talks about how the people there look, their activities, and how they are treated. I evaluate children's books majorly by the message they pass. On messaging, this one scored excellently. Being a Christian, bringing up children by teaching them the values and principles of the Christian faith is quite essential. This book helps pass those messages to kids early in a way that is enjoyable for them. The thing I loved most about the book, however, was the colorful illustrations. Capturing kids' minds can be difficult, and the beautiful and bright images in the book help with that. The cover page shows that the authors invested time and energy to make this book captivating and eye-catching. The language they used was also simple and easy for children to comprehend. The book was also edited perfectly, as I noticed no errors. I did not notice any flaws in this book. Therefore, I'm glad to award it a perfect rating of five out of five stars. It is well-written and captivating for kids. It is also insightful and enriching for kids. I'd recommend it to Christian parents with children between three and ten years of age. I'm sure they'll enjoy reading it."

422 ratings","Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids is a children's book written by Jemima Paul and Arvind Paul. The book is about a young girl named Emma who tells her parents and sister about a dream in which she was taken to heaven. The authors hope that through Emma's journey, they can give children comfort and hope that if they are good on earth, they will have a beautiful life in heaven waiting for them. The story is meant to inspire children to live lives filled with kindness, faith, and love. Emma describes her extraordinary experience of being transported to a beautiful and peaceful place where she meets angels, hears music, and sees incredible sights in the book. She also meets Jesus, who imparts vital messages to her about love, discipline, and living a good life. But Jesus also allowed her to go to hell so she would understand what happens when you are bad and do not repent. The book is beautifully illustrated and written in a simple language that children can understand. My favorite illustration was one of her in a garden with her sister, looking around at the animals. It portrayed animals living in peace, harmony, and unity. I liked how the parents instilled Bible teachings in their children at a young age and prayed as a family. The authors were able to answer all of the necessary questions that small children would ask while reading the book. It was exceptionally well-edited and researched, and I found no errors. I recommend it to Christians, children aged seven and up, and parents who want to read to their younger children. I sat down with my seven-year-old daughter, and she was able to read it in one sitting. It is a heartwarming and uplifting story that encourages children to believe in Christ. It deserves 5 out of 5 stars because there are no negative aspects."

422 ratings","Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids by Jemima Paul and Arvind Paul is a children's book narrating the story of a religious family. This family consists of the firstborn Emma, eight years old, and Bella, six years old. These two girls are raised by their parents to have a fear of God. One night, after their parents tuck them into bed, Emma had a dream about them, Emma and Bella, being brought up to heaven by angels. The next morning, she was so excited to tell the details of her dream to the whole family. Little did she know that this is just the start of the exciting dreams she'll dream of. The first thing that caught my attention is the inserted animations inside the book. There are illustrations in between pages that the kids will enjoy and also help them to visualize and imagine the scenes in their minds. Additionally, some of the illustrations were used as the background of the narration of the story so there are sentences before the illustrations. What I liked here the most is that these sentences are still legible. So despite the colorful illustrations as the background, the sentences are still highlighted. The book is narrated mostly by Emma through the dialogues. So despite the fact that Emma is only eight years old, the author still managed to narrate Emma's dream in a descriptive yet playful way. I didn't find any grammatical errors while reading the book. This factor makes the book exceptionally well-edited. I also didn't find any reason to dislike this book. For the reasons stated above, I rate this book a complete rating of five out of five stars. This book is highly recommended for Christian parents who are looking for a book that will teach their kids lessons about being faithful. The kids could also read this book even without the supervision of their parents since it is easy to understand. However, this book might not be advisable for readers whose beliefs do not align with Christianity since it talks mostly about Christianity."

422 ratings","Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids by Jemima Paul, Arvind Paul is a story about a little girl named Emma, whose parents read the Bible to her and her sister Bella. One night Emma starts to dream about journeys to Heaven, where she will have many adventures. What did the little girl see in Heaven? Or, more importantly, who did she see? First of all, I cannot express how much I admired the illustrations accompanying the story. They were so delicate and beautiful that I found myself stopping while reading just to look at them a little longer. In my opinion, the book fulfils its role as a guide to introduce little children to Christianity and the idea of Heaven. Also, I would say that it would be a helpful tool for families dealing with loss to explain to kids the idea of death and what will happen after it. What is more, the verses from the Bible are a nice touch, as they are a way to give the book a sense of realism so that the children will know Heaven, etc., is not something imagined by the adults. I give Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids a solid 5 out of 5 stars. The story, complemented by the illustrations and the verses, was just beautiful and educational. I could not find any downsides, and moreover, the book is well-edited, as I could not find any errors either. I would recommend this book to children at least five years old or older. Even though they will probably need help from their parents with reading it. In my opinion, they are old enough to remember enough information from the book but still young enough that this form of the book will be interesting to them and will make them curious to learn more about Christianity. It is worth mentioning that it may not be a good book for children who come from families with faith much different than Christianity, as it is based on this religion. "

422 ratings","Childhood is an age where we absorb information without having a filter to determine whether it is good or bad. Some of the information we obtained from our childhood could be the foundation of our character as people. Therefore, it is important to grow up in an environment where we can learn to differentiate between good and bad in the safest place with the safest people. If I am blessed to have a kid someday, this will be added to the list of books that I will read for my child. This book is an example of a safe environment where children can learn lessons in a gentle manner. Emma and Bella are able to learn in such an environment because they have loving parents who put God at the center of their family. It is a kind of environment that lets the children use their imagination and exercise their thoughts, so they can learn from their own perspective. Emma and Bella's parents were just there to answer their questions about their interpretations of what they saw; they served as guides but still let them learn on their own, which for me serves as a great example of a safe environment. I haven't read a children's book in a while, so it felt a bit new to me.The book made me miss being a kid so much. I could feel the warmth while reading it. This would be a perfect example for Christian kids to read. It’s full of innocence and imagination, which makes it fun for children but also provides lessons for them to be kind and good. I like how the author gave a message to the parents in the last part. I like how it gives lessons in a gentle way. This could also create a great bond with children and parents, wherein parents read their children these books and teach them how to be closer to Jesus at the same time."

One day, Emma woke up with joy and said, ""I had a dream about God and heaven."" Her narrative was wonderful and very similar to those in the Bible. Her parents taught her the words of God and the verses that justified or gave even more strength to her dream. Another night, Emma woke up very confused, screaming ""Mommy."" Jesus had shown her what the hell was like. I loved Emma's story as told in this book. It's a truly special book, designed in a format for children. Every two pages, there's a beautiful illustration, and the writing style is very gentle and suitable for children. I also appreciated the perspectives that Emma gained after having these dreams about heaven and hell, and these are convictions that children will also have when reading this book or hearing it from their parents. This book not only shows the miracles that God can perform in the lives of children but also restores faith in Christians. It's a book filled with valuable lessons that will enhance a child's knowledge of Christ. This book beautifully captures the wonder of faith, delivering a heartwarming message that will inspire both children and adults alike. I couldn't find any flaws in this book.

She discovers what is beyond her imagination and perspective after seeing Jesus and meeting God and his angels. Grab Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids by Jemima Paul and Arvind Paul to enjoy the book's chilling effect and wisdom. This is my first reviewed book in my format, with beautiful photos. So far, not quite as high, but close to average. The book is biblical, so you may read it as either fiction or as a bible study guide. It is effective in locating biblical and narrative components. The author's writing style is fascinating and simple to understand, making it suitable for readers with varying degrees of biblical knowledge. Overall, it provides a fresh take on well-known stories and can be a useful resource for personal contemplation or group discourse.  The writers had overlooked the fact that the names of Emma's and Bella's parents were not mentioned in the novel. Given how constant they have been throughout the narrative, their identification should speak for them as well. Bella appreciated Emma's advice on her dreams. But I wanted Bella to have dreams as well. Perhaps they are God's special regulations. Perhaps the author might have specified whether or not Bella's position required luck. I strongly rate it 5 out of 5 stars. The book was exceptionally well edited. I haven't discovered any mistakes. Everything I stated about the bad elements is my take on the novel. Still, the book is wonderful. I suggest the book to Christians who enjoy the Bible. The plot of the book is excellent. It also integrates key Christian ideals and lessons, making it an excellent addition to the library of any Christian teen. The storytelling material is both commendable and informative."

422 ratings","""Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids"" by Jemima Paul with Arvind Paul is an amazing storybook for Children that talks of an eight years old Emma who was snatched to heaven several times in her dreams, with her little sister Bella by an Angel of the Lord. Emma saw God and heaven (pgs 2, 3, and 7). On one of her visits, God took her to hell and she had a terrible experience (pgs. 24-25). In the end, Emma understood that God gave her this dream to evangelists to other children by telling them that heaven and hell are real (pg. 32, 34). The book ""Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids"" is authored by two persons that are Jemima Paul and Arvind Paul. This is an amazing book that not only teaches children to do evangelism but also teaches parents to help their children understand the importance of evangelism. The negative aspect I picked from this book is that the author's character Emma made a statement of what she saw in her dream contrary to the scriptures (pg. 11) that is: "" I saw God. God looked a lot Like Jesus....."". The Bible made it clear that no one can see God and live again (Exodus 33: 20). I rate the book 4 out of 4 for recommendation and 5 out of 5 for rating. I recommend that this book should be read by every kid who can read and as well for every parent to read the book to their children during their story time. Also, every children's minister can use the book as one of their lessons book."

Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids
422 ratings","Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids by Jemima Paul and Arvind Paul is a fictional story about a young girl named Emma who visits Heaven in her dreams with her sister Bella. She finds Heaven very beautiful and loves every second of it, so when she wakes up and tells her family, she prays she can go again. One night she didn’t dream of a place as beautiful. Instead, she dreamt of a horrible place, Hell. Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids is a story that I really enjoyed because it was so beautifully written and touched my heart as a Christian woman who loves children so much. I loved how every page a child could learn something new about Heaven, Hell, and especially Jesus. The story was very descriptive of what Emma saw in Heaven and taught it using biblical scriptures. I also enjoyed the illustration paired with the story because it brought the words to life allowing children to see how it was described in the Bible. I enjoyed this story. There wasn’t anything negative about this book - despite the typos that appeared rarely- everything is enjoyable and you wouldn’t put it down unhappy. You would leave learning something new that you can teach to others. I rate Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids by Jemima Paul and Arvind Paul five out of five because I really loved this story, the typos were very rare, and it is something the kids should learn from. I also loved how they included the parents although it is a children's story. It sends a message that parents could learn too, not just children. I would recommend this book for anyone to read, but especially young children. This book could be for children who love God and parents who want to teach about Heaven and Hell to their children. I believe that this story provides a perfect introduction to Christianity and provides important lessons for all to learn."

422 ratings","Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids by Jemima Paul and Arvind Paul is about Emma and Bella, young kids in a Christian family whose parents read the bible to them every night. They do this so that their children may know God and love him. Emma begins to have vivid dreams and describes them as best as a child can articulate. Her parents take her seriously and use her vivid dreams as a teaching moment to reinforce the scriptures of the bible. The story illustrates her experience with sister Bella as they visit both heaven and hell with Jesus. This short story has clear and colorful illustrations with simple terms and concepts that are fitting for children. The authors did a great job of conveying their message in a very digestible way. I also commend them for adding the footnotes of relevant scripture for the bible. This is definitely a heartwarming and inspiring story for religious families. I admire the moral teachings that illustrate to children the importance of right and wrong. There are no critiques that come to mind about this short story. It was concise and clearly conveyed the intended message for the target audience. I would certainly recommend this book to be a part of the Christian teaching curriculum for kids. The illustrations perfectly relayed what the text was describing making it a good learning tool for children that are not able to read yet. With that being said I rate this book a 5 out of 5 stars on account of no errors, good editing and superb illustration. Seeing children passionate and enthusiastic about their beliefs is absolutely inspiring and touching. I would recommend maybe a softer approach for the introduction of hell. For young children, this may have the effect of a scary story before bed. The description of hell could have been less graphic."

422 ratings","Jemima Paul and Arvind Paul’s Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids is an exceptionally written children’s book. The main character is little Emma, who after dreaming about flying to heaven with her little sister Bella, gets excited about sharing it all with her parents the next day and prays to God every night to return to that magical place. What adventures does she face and what important lessons does her journey teach us? I found this book extremely heartwarming and simple to understand for little kids, it’s useful as it gives an early introduction to Christianity and explains everything that needs to be known; I loved that there are many references to the Bible, with little notes by the end of the page to help find the verses. The illustrations are creative and colorful, they definitely help keep the kids interested in the story. I couldn’t find one single flaw in this book, it’s skillfully written and edited, it cleared some doubts I had about religion, and at some point, it even touched me, it really does help understand something so big by explaining it in such simple words, I think we adults have yet to learn many things, and doing it with our kids is the best. In my opinion, this book absolutely deserves 5 out of 5 stars, reading it is so worth it, literally flawless!! I had no problem with downloading it, viewing the images or the text. It was clear and an overall easy read. As someone who has worked in a professional environment with children aged 0-3 years old before, I recommend this book to kids aged 6-9 years old, because I think they’re capable of understanding the concept and can really put into action what they learned, also, because there’s more text than drawings and their attention span is higher than really young children."

Read about Emma's fantastical dreams as she sees what heaven is like with God and Jesus today. I think ""Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids"" is an amazing book. From the illustrations to the descriptions, and even quoting phrases from the Bible, I found this book a pleasure to read. Emma's vivid and colorful descriptions of Heaven, and Bella's adorable and amusing reactions, down to their parent's strong support, pride in their children, and love made this book beautifully fantastic. If I am being completely honest, I can not find anything negative to say about ""Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids"". Its colorful illustrations and vivid descriptions, going as far as accurately quoting from the Bible, even stating where it was quoted from, I found it to be a wonderfully beautiful children's book.

422 ratings",This Book is so good. Especially if you have young children and want them to learn about god in a easy way. Highly recommend it for younger audiences. I wish i had this book growing up for my younger siblings. You're never to young to learn about the lord and this story tells it all. Keeps it simple for young minds and even have good illustrations. When I talk about spiritual things sometimes people say I'm like a child. Reading this book made me feel the excitement of a child who is going on vacation to a new place. If heaven is going to be our future permanent home then don't you think it would be fun to know all about it? In this book Randy Alcorn answers a great deal of questions. Will we have the same nationality as on earth? So many questions! There are lots of fun ideas like how we might learn many different languages or how we might get to invent and explore. There is a little bit of information on what the New Heaven and New Earth will look like. There is also a description of the New Jerusalem. This book explains that we will never get bored in heaven. It also explains how we might explore the universe. This book not only explains heaven in great detail but it also tells children how to make sure they are going to heaven. I can recommend this book to kids but parents might also love reading it. The only thing I think they could have done was to create pictures. Instead they have pictures of the same kid's faces all through the book. Some pictures of how an artist might imagine heaven would have been fantastic. Maybe they'll think of that in the future. After all books can always be improved. I give this book a 5 out of 5!!

422 ratings","I thoroughly enjoyed reading “Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids”. The book is about a family that is Christian and the parents teach the children about heaven every day. The book goes into detail the whole way through with definitive lines notated straight from the Bible. One of the children, Emma, has several dreams about being flown to heaven by angels. She tells her family distinct memories from her dream about what she sees in heaven. She gives detailed examples of golden streets and the perfect temperature and all the rooms in God’s golden house. She tells of people living there all being if the same middle age. Also that they eat and there are fruit trees. The details in this book pain the perfect picture of what the author is trying to portray, in my opinion. I give this book a 5/5 rating as it is amazing. No errors were found due to wonderful editing. I found no profanity either. She even has one dream where she is introduced to hell and Satan. Again, very vivid details about what she sees and feels. And she explains everything so expertly to her family. I feel like this is one of the most bible centered, family oriented, perfectly illustrated books I have ever read. My wish is that every family have this book in their at home library and read to their children and grand children. Even habit passed down from one generation to another it is truely a superb book."

In this clever and captivating story, eight-year-old Emma and six-year-old Bella take their parents through a riveting tale of Emma's dreams. Emma dreams about visiting Heaven on multiple occasions with her sister, Bella. They go to Heaven with Angels and meet Jesus. Jesus shows them parts of Heaven and briefly shows them Hell. The story takes us through many Bible stories that are easy to understand and fun to learn about. I was pleasantly surprised to find so many pages of beautiful artwork. The placement of the artwork felt purposeful and reiterated the words written on the page. I was grateful for the art while the story talked about Hell. The artwork and dialogue during this part of the story made me feel safe while reading about something scary. As a parent, I recommend this book to anyone looking to introduce their children to Christianity. The story explains things such as Angels, God, Jesus, Heaven, Hell, and the Bible. The story and the artwork worked together to paint a beautiful picture of Emma's dreams, and it was easy to create an image in my mind due to the detail in the story. The story was easy to read and follow and would be easy to read to a child. I give this book 5/5 stars. I felt that it was engaging and clever. Using dialogue and a fun family dynamic made this a great read. The artwork within made the story come to life. My only critique would be that I wish it lasted longer! I hope the authors take this concept and create other Bible-based stories that are easy and fun. I am excited to see what they do next!"

I found no errors in grammar or punctuation and it was written from a child’s perspective. The author did an amazing job of telling this story with easy to follow illustrations. This should be in every Library! The details describing the appearance of Heaven with the Golden Streets and Castle will spark the imagination of any child as well as their curiosity. The feelings that the writer invoked about being in heaven were well described portraying peace and happiness. The author is very descriptive of the appearance of Jesus, God as well as the angels. I enjoyed how it was described that angels were worshipping and dancing. I was also impressed with how the description of Hell portrayed how it is described in the Bible. By connecting the descriptions of feelings and clothing worn by Jesus, God, the Angels as well as those who were in Hell to the characters gives a reader a good sense of the differences in Eternity. I especially was impressed at the way the writer had the parents explain things to the girls directly from scripture, giving the girls references to connect the dreams to the Scripture and allowing them to understand the meanings of the dreams! The ending was done well and leaves an opening for future books involving these characters as they grow and mature. I give this book a 5 out of 5 it is very well written!"

It relays the story of an 8 year old girl Emma where she is carried into heaven through her dreams. Emma then conveys it to her family where they enduringly listens and explains what little Emma has witnessed. Emma on the other hand is stoutly waiting to spread the message of heaven and Jesus to the world The book with its colourful illustration is beautifully compiled and I am sure it is gripped by the young audience. No evidence of any typos or profanity found. It is all put together in very simple language where a child could read all alone without a parent. I should say it is actually professionally edited. I felt contented to see Emma s little sisters receptiveness to the story and how she actually participated throughout. Parents here are such active listeners and it shows how actual parenting looks like ..They patiently listens and interprets what emma witnesses where they totally deserves a round of applause. ""The Bible tells us that there will be no sickness or pain in the heaven"".. Though the book is Christianity centred, it is in similarity with other religious believes as well where heaven is a place where good people spends eternity. It implies god is heaven, as heaven is his dwelling place. The book encourages us to do good and good only to reach our final destination heaven. It also warns us what evil can bring with a complete terrified scenario of hell and the life out there. I totally loved the concept of the book and there is nothing I dislike. With full heart I rate the book four out of 4 stars this is definitely a bedtime read for children 4 to 15 years... I would even rate it 5 out of 5 stars for its flawless compilation... It will do a lot for their moral development.. so let's hold hands together and take a walk in heaven"

One night, Emma has a magical dream where she and her sister Bella are taken on a journey to heaven. The very next day, Emma shares her dream with her family. The dream was so magical that Emma prayed for more heavenly dreams. The book is simply written, with simple formulations and short sentences that are appropriate for young children and easy to understand. Also, the catchy and colourful illustrations in the book work well with the story and were definitely the icing on the cake. Common religious beliefs are well portrayed in the book. One of the common beliefs being portrayed is the belief that people will be held accountable for their actions in life. People who perform good actions in the course of their lives will enter heaven, whereas those who perform bad actions in their lives will enter hell. Although the book relays common beliefs found in all religions, it is not appropriate for all religions as it focuses heavily on Christian beliefs.  The one thing I dislike about the book is the portrayal of hell in the story. I feel the writers could have been gentler. Although I fully understand the writers' intentions behind their detailed descriptions of hell, the portrayal of hell is not appropriate for children, especially sensitive children. I give this book 5 out of 5 stars. The book is easy to understand, and I found no grammatical errors. Although I disliked the detailed descriptions of hell, I believe the book still serves as a good motivator for young children to do good and avoid bad.  I would suggest this short and sweet but powerful book to Christian parents, as the book relays important Christian beliefs. I suggest parents read this book to their children at bedtime. It will most definitely serve as motivation for children to do their best.  Thank you to the writers Jemima Paul and Arvind Paul for this great book."

The book is professionally written and edited. No grammar or spelling errors were found. The book is quite easy for a young reader to follow along. The characters and dialogue are very relatable to a young audience and the discussions about the Christian faith were very age appropriate for children. I found the hand-drawn illustrations to be very colourful and delightful to look at and the images depicted helped to visually tell the story. This book is both entertaining as a children's book but also as an educational book for children's biblical studies. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the magical way in which a child could envision heaven to be like and I am easily able to imagine a young child anxious to go to bed each night so that they can travel back to His wondrous kingdom.

What would be Emma's answer? This book is a great introduction to Christianity, the teachings of the Bible, Jesus, and prayer, also the salvation message. Emma has a vivid and radiant dream of heaven. Along with a scary and horrible dream of hell. I'm sure just about all of us at one time or another. Have wondered what it is like on the other side of this life. For the Christian faith, the Bible contains some answers to our questions. This book takes a simplistic look at what the Bible declares. About the afterlife both the good and bad sides of it. With excellent text and colorful captivating illustrations. It also includes Bible verses. That you can look up for future reference and study.

Emma have just had a wonderful dream about heaven and told her parents and her sister Bella about the dream. She prayed to God to keep bringing the dream to her and Emma continued to tell her family about the goodness of heaven. Every time that Emma told the dream about heaven, her father would read some verses from the bible to prove Emma right. Emma said that she had a stomach ache but when they went to heaven, she felt fine. That entailed that there was no sickness in heaven. Emma was also taken to hell by Jesus to see how horrible it was. I think this book will help some parents to believe in their children's dreams without judging them wrong. And it can also help young people to believe in their dreams. Religious people can also get a better understanding of the heavens if they go through this book. Being that the book talks more about religion, it can help religious people by strengthening their faith in God. My favorite part of the book is where Bella could always ask questions that happened to be so important, and her father would read a verse to give Bella the answers she needed. Boys and Girls between the age of 3 to 6 would admire this book because it enables them to learn to respect and obey God in their early life. As we know from the book children are innocent creatures and people should be as innocent as children. I give this book a rating 5 out of 5 since I believe that it is good for children to learn more about God's goodness and it was also well-edited."

The book provides children with an understanding of what heaven is to be like based off of the Bible. It contains illustrations that provide the reader with a visualization of heaven as well. Emma is an eight-year-old girl who falls asleep one night and dreams about God and heaven. When she wakes in the morning, she is excited to tell her sister and parents all about what she had seen. Her parents are just as excited and confirm what she has dreams of is what the Bible says heaven would be like. She learns it can be fun and she can make friends, but she also learns about hell and how it isn't a good place to spend eternity. This book would be best suited for elementary-aged children. It also would be good for parents to read to their children. The book wouldn't be one for anyone who doesn't believe in religion, God, or heaven. It also would be below the reading level of older youth so they would want to skip it as well. I found Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids to be a unique story about heaven and what it would be like. The authors do an amazing job describing a fun and peaceful place. The authors also include biblical references to show the reader how the Bible explains how heaven would appear. The illustrations in the book go perfectly with the story. They add to the story and give younger readers a better understanding of what Emma is describing.

The book is exceptionally edited and written with no errors along with its excellent layout and stunning art. However, the story mentions Hell and Emma is scared when she sees it, although it is described in a soft subtle way, which I believe families would consider telling their children about it because the Bible tells of it. I especially loved the Bible readings from the parents that gave their children a lesson about God and Jesus. Furthermore, this book gives children a unique opportunity to learn the teachings of Jesus. It is an encouraging story and it would be useful for families. The story is educational and is of great value for schools along with children’s religious groups because it gives some insight into religious teachings.

Emma has two younger sisters, and the two of them share a comfortable apartment with their parents. Every night before they go to bed, the parent prioritizes teaching them from the Bible and leading them in family prayer.  She was so thrilled when she had a dream about heaven one night that she told her family about it. She afterward dreamed about heaven and hell. When she dreamed, what did she see? What response did she get from her family when she revealed her dream? What is the meaning of this dream she had?  The intriguing book Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids by Jemima Paul and Arvind Paul teaches love, faith, and many other important lessons. The children's excellent upbringing taught me something. I have learned that having our children near us offers them the opportunity to talk to us about most of their problems or worries. In addition, I discovered that no matter how busy our schedules may be, we should always listen to what the kids have to say.  This book is broken up into a number of sections, each with a lovely title. It also includes a few biblical texts that support or add to certain points. For ease of understanding, it also includes lovely images. The writing is clear, well-developed, and not overly complicated in the book. No grammatical or typographical problems can be found, and the characters were well-developed. Because of this, it is exceptionally well-edited.  There were no issues I encountered when reading this book. As a result, I'll rate it five out of five stars. Anyone who wants to learn more about heaven and hell should read it, in my opinion.

Their book tells the story of eight-year-old Emma and her journey to heaven and hell in her dreams. In these dreams, she is accompanied by her six-year-old sister Bella. Is God looking to give Emma a mission or a message? I enjoyed this book a lot. I think the co-authors work very well together. I also enjoyed how they did not sugarcoat anything and included heaven and hell in this children's book. Because more often than not they sugarcoat things for children and don't include hell in children's books. It brings me back to my childhood and reminds me of being sent to Sunday school every Sunday morning. Unfortunately, I have to include the things I dislike about this book. Though I greatly enjoyed the book. I disliked the use of the word ""snatched"" in the title. I feel like it's too harsh to explain Emma and her sister's journey to heaven. I feel that Jemima and Arvind could have found much better words to use. I think this book was well written. I also think this story was professionally edited.This is why i give the book five out of 5 stars. It's really worth reading. However, I think those who read it should be from a religious background. for there is a lot of religious content in this story. It's a perfect bedtime story for sunday night."

I especially liked the biblical annotations that help point us parents right to the direct word of God on this subject! My 6 year old daughter and 8 year old son both loved reading this story and asked many questions, which allowed us to expand on the conversation about where we go when we die and how we, as Christians, have a responsibility to adhere to God’s word and principles. This book also sparked an excitement in my children knowing that the troubles we will go through in this life are temporary and we will spend eternity in such a beautiful place. While Heaven is easy and fun to talk about, Hell can be a little trickier. The author did a fantastic job presenting hell in a very real way that younger kids can comprehend and gain a healthy fear of, but also showing how we can ensure we don’t have to worry about going to Hell when we put our lives in Jesus Christ. This is a timeless story that can be enjoyed for generations to come. Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids was put together with no grammatical errors found and was in language that my 2nd and 4th grader could easily read out loud to the family. The illustrations were fun to look at and we talked about the pictures (“Is this really what Heaven looks like?!”) almost as much as we read the story itself. I would love to have this book in a completed format and to share it with all my mom friends to read to their children! We will be reading this book many more times!"

Every night they read the Bible and pray together as a family before the girls drift off to sleep. Unexpectedly, Emma has a strange dream where she and Bella are carried up to Heaven. When she wakes up, she excitedly relays the dream to her parents. Her parents confirm that everything she saw matches quotes in the Bible. She then prays to be taken to Heaven again, not knowing if her prayers are to be answered.

This approach is particularly effective when it comes to teaching children about difficult topics like heaven and hell. Speaking of hell, I was impressed by the book's willingness to tackle this subject head-on. The depiction of hell is not meant to scare children, but rather to help them understand the consequences of sin. The ugliness of hell serves as a powerful motivator for young readers to turn away from anything that might lead them down the wrong path. In addition to teaching children about the consequences of sin, ""Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids"" also offers a message of hope and redemption.

422 ratings","Avind Paul and Jemima Paul's Snatched Up to Heaven is an excellent read and the perfect children's book that blends in a parent's love and care with teachings of love, obedience, and morality. Eight-year-old Bella lives with her parents, her six-year-old little sister, Emma, and their baby sister in a typical Christian home, raised with adequate love, care, support, and attention that's appropriate for kids their age. One night (and several nights later), they were snatched up to Heaven by angels, where they experienced the stories and teachings they'd gotten about heaven from their parents firsthand. There, they met Jesus, who taught them about love, faith, and the reward for obedience. They also get to see the suffering and agony experienced by those in hell. One of the major reasons I enjoyed this children's book was the vivid description and the illustrations utilised by the authors in telling their stories. Another reason I liked the book was how easy it was for the authors to simplify complicated Christian and spiritual contexts in a way that was easy enough for even children to grasp. The authors told their stories with appropriate pictures that would keep the young audience hooked until the end. I also liked the fact that the choice of vocabulary the authors employed will be easily understood by young readers. I found myself with absolutely no dislikes for the book throughout my reading period. I'd rate this book 5 out of 5 stars because I had no dislikes whatsoever about the book, and it was flawlessly edited. I'd recommend this book to a young audience (which is quite obvious because it's a children's book) and to parents who'd love to instill morality in their children and teach them the importance of obedience without taking away the love, care, and attention directed towards the children."

422 ratings","A book that truly captured my heart is Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids by Jemima Paul and Aving Paul. It is a story that portrays the essence of the Christian belief. As a Religious Educator myself, I believe that what has been written is a book that truly seeks to educate our young one’s on Heaven and Hell, Jesus and God, angels, and the values that incorporate all the Christian belief. The story is about Emma, an eight-year-old that has the most beautiful dreams ever (except for once). She dreams every night that she is taken to the sky where she makes different experiences of heaven. One she met Jesus and God and she described how they are so similar in age yet clothed differently. Once she saw people eating and even saw the patriarchs from the past! She made even new friends. Emma however, once experienced something that was very very scary that she wanted no one to experience. The book is a narrative that instills in the young one the love for the Christian belief. The authors managed to write in a very beautiful way about how children see heaven and hell. I loved how all the references made in the Bible are put down in the book itself. This makes the story more authentic to the Bible since it contains references to it. The illustrations are phenomenal and every page captures the pure and innocent essence of the story. It is a very heartwarming experience to see the essence of the book. Even the language used was very simple for children to understand which makes the story unique. It can be an extraordinary experience for children to read the book or to have it read to them by a family member. Well done to the authors!"

422 ratings","The short story 'Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids', is a children's book that deals with the difference between heaven and hell. There were two children here who had a dream with God the Father, who showed paradise how beautiful it was, gave them a glimpse of what heaven looked like, what kind of people were there and what reward awaits those who are still waiting. There are verses from the bible where they come across a philosophy of exposition. Hell is also shown in extreme heat, people are worm-eaten, thirsty and they are suffering from extreme pain. So if I were you, where do you want to be heaven or hell, then when are you going to do the right thing? Recommendation (would you recommend this book? Who to? Why? ) I recommend the short children's story 'Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids' to children aged 4-8 because it is about our Lord God to shape their spiritual personality.

Emma and Bella live very normal childhoods. They are like any average 8-year-old and 6-year-old. They have a loving mom and dad and are well taken care of. Throughout their young childhood, Emma and Bella's parents have been trying to teach them about God and His love for His children and how they should love God back. Every night, their parents tucked them into bed, but one night, something magical and unexplainable happened... Angels came down and took Emma and Bella to Heaven! Emma describes Heaven exactly like how it is portrayed in the Bible. There is no fear, no worry, and overall, just a pure and wonderful place. She describes God as wearing a clean, white robe with red fabric draped across His shoulder. She says the angels are dressed in white, the city is made of gold, and a lot of rooms in Heaven. Throughout the book, Emma continues to have these wonderful dreams about visiting God and Heaven. Every morning, Emma is so excited to tell her sister and her parents about her trip to Heaven! Then, one night, Emma woke up frantically because of a dream she had. This time, God didn't take her to Heaven, he took her to Hell! Emma is terrified of Hell but knows that Jesus is with her and will protect her. After talking with their parents, Emma and Bella understand that they need Jesus in order to live eternally in Heaven with Him. They also decide that everyone needs to accept Jesus into their lives so that they don't go to Hell, where it is terrible. I give this book 5 out of 5 stars. I really like how the author made the concept of Heaven and Hell easier for little ones to understand."

One chapter's cursory reference to hell's specifics suggests that the writers decided not to go into great detail about it—possibly in an effort to keep readers from being frightened. The writers also offer a note for parents that addresses how parents might approach having these conversations with their kids. ""Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids"" not only teaches kids about the effects of sin, but it also conveys a message of hope and salvation. The book describes how we can be saved and how we can support those who might be having a hard time figuring things out. For young readers who might be having difficulties with their own faith or going through a difficult period in their life, this message is especially crucial. All things considered, I heartily endorse ""Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids"" to parents, teachers, and everyone else searching for a book that will uplift and instruct young readers. The book's lessons are a great way to start conversations on morality, religion, and the afterlife. Teachers of Sunday schools who are searching for interesting and educational lessons to educate their students may find the book to be a valuable resource. The book is a 5 out of 5 with nothing to dislike."

Emma's descriptions of heaven are awe-inspiring, with streets of pure gold, a golden house, and a massive rainbow that fills the entire sky. She tells her parents about Jesus being the light of heaven and the angels and that all wounds and sickness disappear when you enter heaven. Then Emma sees something scary. As they entered the darkness, Jesus lit up the surroundings for them to see. She dreamt about another dark, hot place with people screaming and worms crawling. People were hungry and thirsty and had no food or water. There were no beds for them to sleep on when they were tired and no medicine to heal them if they were wounded as they were trying to escape the fire. She dreamt about Satan and demons. She was scared and wanted to wake her dad to discuss this dream. What do you think this dream meant? The book also features Bible verses that reinforce the message of living a Godly life, making it an excellent resource for families who want to teach their children about Christianity. The author has incorporated the references to bible verses so well that it deciphers the whole dream. My children were captivated by the story's descriptions and imaginative portrayal of heaven.

We should pray to God daily or have a good connection with God in order to go to heaven. The book clearly depicts how Heaven and Hell look, as perfectly described in the Holy Bible. The book is not just a little description of Heaven and hell. It also tells us about love, communication, and the bond between parents and children. The parents guide their children through the word of God by reading verses from the Bible to them. It teaches parents how to raise a good Christian in this age, how to tell them about God, and how to read the Bible to them every day. It also teaches how children should be raised in this world, how we can tell them about God’s love, and how we can promote or engage them in reading and believing in God. It teaches us that we should do good things to enter or have a place in heaven. The book describes every detail of how Heaven and hell look, such as shiny seats and no need for lamps, and how people are crying for food without mercy or help from anyone. It portrays how some people are happy in one place while others are dying of diseases in another. What a lovely and wonderful place heaven is, and on the other hand, what a disaster place where everyone is crying and weeping for love and some hope for the afterlife. Where you can meet your guardian angels whom you have read about in the Bible and, on the other hand, cannot recognize anyone or want to meet anyone. This book is the perfect description of Heaven and God’s love for children.”"

The author brings out the real image of heaven and hell so as to show the children that hell is a real place just as heaven is. He shows them how best to live so as not to go to hell, as those in hell also know that Jesus exists. Emma guides us on how to help others be able to go to heaven, as she does not want to see anyone suffer in hell.  The author also helps ingrain good morals in the children. Emma reminds us that it is good to knock on the door before going in. She also reminds us of the importance of good relations with others, as they were in heaven. The importance of friends, just as Emma and her sister Bella were, as she says they were always together.  The author also brings out the role of parents in the upbringing of children as they grow up spiritually. Emma’s parents listened to her dream and believed what she was telling them. Afterwards, they helped reassure her, and when she had a bad dream, they also comforted her. They confirmed all she had dreamed about by reading bible verses on the same and corrected them whenever they needed it.  With the use of vivid description to bring out the exact image of what takes place in heaven and hell, the author makes it easier for the readers to understand. He also uses pictures to illustrate, which helps the readers memorise the book. I would rate the book 5 out of 5. There is nothing I dislike about the book.

I can exhort the book to children growing up, as it will help them by pulling them closer to God. "

It provides a short but soft and potent introduction to the concepts of God, Jesus, heaven, and hell in a way that is creative and easy enough for children to understand. The addition of illustrations also serves to capture and hold the attention of the target audience. The story follows eight-year-old Emma on her adventures as she dreams. She is the oldest of three girls, living comfortably with her mother and father. She dreams of her and her younger sister, Bella, being carried up to heaven by angels. On getting to heaven, Jesus shows her different wonderful things about heaven. She is also shown hell and sees the suffering that goes on there. After each dream, she narrates her experience to her mother, father, and younger sister.

Eventually, she decides to spread the good news of heaven and the horrors of hell to everyone around her to save more people. The plot of the book was interesting.

422 ratings","This was a great book for children with a lot of depth to it. At first, I thought the concept of the little girl visiting Heaven in her dreams was going to be overly cheesy, but this narrative device was used quite well to impart theological truths in a way children could understand. It is laid out well for reading aloud for children, with the artwork set beside the pages of text. The artwork is bright and eye-catching. It’s a style that children will enjoy. The theological content is robust. I was really impressed. Sometimes books for children about Bible stories are overly cutesy and do not really impart the truth of the Gospel. This book delves deep, and includes many Scripture references, including Isaiah and Revelation. It lends itself well for reading from the Bible with your children. There is even a note for parents in the back with a prayer to walk through with the children when they understand the Gospel and are ready to accept Jesus. I would say the book is better for slightly older children, say no younger than kindergarten age. It would be a bit too advanced for toddlers. It introduces very weighty concepts to young children in a way they can comprehend. It does discuss the concept of Hell. Parents should be aware of that in case they don’t want to introduce their child to that yet. I would rate this book 5 out of 5 stars. It is very well produced, with excellent editing, good layout, and fun artwork. The editing was top-notch, I did not find a single typo. It is bright, engaging, and good for small children. It discusses very difficult theological concepts in a way children can grasp, and even helps parents learn how to have those conversations with their children."

Though they were trying to escape from it they could not. At that time Daddy taught her that those people who had committed sin would be punished like this and those who were with good deeds would be rewarded with heaven. The book will be a good option for parents who wish to inculcate the lessons of love and morals of Christian religion to their kids. Moreover it tries to warn that though people are sinners in this world, god is patiently waiting for them to repent, confess and this patience may eventually run out and wants everyone not to take that chance and accept Jesus as their Saviour. This book can be easily comprehended by children because of the simplicity of language used. This can be recommended as a good book for kids those who are just starting to reading. The book can be rated 5 stars due to its content clarity, proper illustrations used and good layout."

422 ratings","If you're a Christian parent looking for a book to teach your children about the concepts of heaven and hell, ""Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids"" by Jemima Paul and Arvind Paul is a good choice. There's an adult version of the same book, but it is far more complex, which is why I think the authors wrote a kids' version. It is about two sisters' dreams about heaven and hell. Eight-year-old Emma, alongside her six-year-old sister Bella, lived with their parents in a loving home. One night, when sleeping, Emma dreams about heaven. She dreamt that angels carried her and Bella to heaven, a place filled with wonders. It was a beautiful and sparkling place, with golden streets and a golden house. She also meets several biblical figures, like Queen Esther and Noah, and has a personal interaction with Jesus. However, it's not all fun and games when she also sees hell, and what she sees scares her. To avoid spoilers, I'll leave it to you to complete the rest of the book. As I said earlier, this is a good book to teach your children about heaven and hell and also let them have fun with an interesting story. It can be effectively used to teach your young ones the importance of living a life in accordance with God's teachings and obeying God's words. It instills important morals and values by teaching the goodness in heaven that awaits those who walk upright and the torment in hell that those who are greedy, jealous, thieves, and other bad characters will face. It is short and simple to read, so your children won't struggle to get through it. I found nothing to dislike about the book, and I highly recommend it to Christian parents for their children. I rate the book 5 out of 5 stars, and I found no justification to give it a lower rating. The editing quality of the book is exceptional."

422 ratings","The life of young Emma, who was raised alongside her sister Bella in a Christian home, is the focus of this book. Emma is taught about Jesus, the beauty of heaven, and God's love for everyone by her parents, who read aloud to them from the Bible every day. Emma becomes fascinated by this to the point where she starts dreaming about it. And with that, Emma is taken up to heaven in her dreams. She confides in her family after witnessing numerous amazing things in paradise, and they support and encourage her. Snatched Up to Heaven is a children's book that aims to instill a knowledge of God in young children. It is a great way to introduce the concept of Christ to young readers and urge them to get closer to God, who will embrace them and offer them hope. Considering that this book was written with young readers in mind, I like how straightforward it is. It was sufficiently simple for the kids to understand, thanks to Jemima Paul and Arvind Paul Children's Books. Kids would better understand the ideas covered in this book thanks to the pictorial depiction, which further enhanced its appealing elements. And last, it was just fantastic when someone used scripture to emphasize a point that was presented since it gave the reference gravitas. This is a children's book; the topics covered were done so professionally, and it is not intended to be overly complicated. It was simple and educational, lacking a lot of plot twists and turns that could confuse some younger readers. It contained many important moral teachings. All of this is to say that I think this book is fantastic and have nothing against it! I give this book a five out of five star rating. It has flawless editing, zero mistakes, fantastic image references, amazing moral lessons, and a writing style that is both effective and simple to understand. I'd suggest it to kids of all ages. Though religious beliefs may vary, I think this book's moral lessons and message of optimism are universal."

Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids
422 ratings","This book is a very short read, and this is typical, as it is a children’s book. It is about the dreams of 8-year-old Emma and 6-year-old Bella that they shared with their family and the mysteries of heaven and hell that they experienced within. This book is unique in the sense that it is open for interpretation and belief. Some may argue that this is a mere fiction of the kid’s imagination, but a true believer may believe otherwise, like I do. This book is an eye-opener and a revelation in its most mysterious form, a child’s dream, and God does work in mysterious ways. I absolutely enjoyed reading this book as an adult and would highly recommend this book for children to gain a basic understanding of the Christian Faith, Heaven, and Hell. The book really caters to a child’s curiosity and will thrill them whilst educating them in the ways of Christ with valuable morals and lessons embedded in this brief yet powerful read. I rate this book 5/5 because it is a fantastic children's book with easy-to-understand text and phrases, as well as stunning watercolor illustrations and figures that are sure to captivate younger readers. I again recommend this book for a Christian parent looking to solidify your children’s belief in the word because, since the girls' experiences are discussed by the family, it's an avenue to use the opportunity to talk with your own family and gain more knowledge about Christ and his word. Another reason I gave this book a perfect rating is because it was written for children, yet it provides for a unified sense of understanding. I also like the fact that it used quotes from the Bible as references to describe each of the accounts given by the kids. This book contains absolutely no profanity, and not one typographical/grammatical error was in sight. A true editorial masterclass, I must say."

422 ratings","Raising children is not easy these days. Parents redouble their efforts to keep their children on the straight and narrow. To do so, it is always good to guide them to Jesus. Jemima Paul and Arvind Paul's book is a children's book that shows how essential Jesus is in the life of every child. This allows them to know the Bible which contains the word of God. The book is about a wonderful family that lives happily and believes in the word of God. Emma is a little girl who believes in God and dreams almost every night that she is visiting Heaven with her sister Bella. She lived the most beautiful thing of her life because she has never seen anything so wonderful as paradise. She always tells her dreams to her family and her parents told her that her dreams confirm everything that is said in the Bible. She also visited hell in her dreams. She told her family it was horrible. Therefore, she wants to spread the word of God in order to allow others to go to Heaven. This story shows us how important it is to obey the word of God. What is fascinating in the story is the way the parents of the little girl listen to her attentively and clearly explain to her what she does not understand. This book is very understandable and there are pictures to illustrate each passage. It can be used in more contexts in other words in several places like: at school, at church and at home. Thus, children will be able to tell the difference between heaven and hell and they will behave better with their parents and those around them as well. I give this book 4 out of 4 stars because it is positive and informative. Besides , the book was well edited. That's why I couldn't find any errors. For all parents who want to introduce their children to biblical things, I highly recommend this book. If they don't have that intention, they don't need to read it."

Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids
422 ratings","Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids by Jemima Paul and Arvind Paul is a book that introduces children to the idea of heaven through dreams. The story follows two sisters, Emma and Bella, but mainly focuses on Emma, who has vivid dreams about heaven. Emma is so excited to share her dreams with her family that she can’t wait to tell them everything she sees. What makes this even more special is that Emma’s dreams match exactly with what the Bible says about heaven, making the experience even more meaningful for her and her family. The book does a wonderful job of portraying heaven as a place full of light, beauty, and peace. The descriptions of the characters and their activities, along with the ones of flowers and fruits, give the kids a colorful and joyful picture of what heaven might be like. The authors also talk about hell after Emma had a nightmare about it; they do it in a very gentle way, making sure it’s not too scary for young readers. This balance helps children understand the importance of faith without overwhelming them. Another thing I loved about this book is the drawings. They are vibrant and full of life, perfectly matching the mystic feeling of the story. The illustrations help bring Emma’s dreams to life, making it easier for kids to imagine heaven. The book is also professionally edited, as I didn’t find a single mistake, which made it a smooth and enjoyable read. There is nothing I disliked about this book. I give Snatched Up to Heaven for Kids a full 5 out of 5 stars. I also plan to read the adult version, Snatched Up to Heaven! I highly recommend this book to all Christian families who want to teach their children about faith and give them a lovely picture of what heaven might be like."

CHAPTER 1
THE SLEEPLESS NIGHT
March 14, 2030
Dr. Joshua Lee rolled onto his back and stared at the ceiling. It was impossible to go back to sleep. He sighed and asked his virtual assistant, Sylvia, what time it was. Her response didn’t help: “Good morning, Joshua. It is 4:33 a.m. local time, 6:33 p.m. Sydney time. Would you like me to summarize your upcoming day?”
“God no,” Joshua mumbled.
“Alright, Joshua. Please let me know if you need anything,” Sylvia replied.
At least he had gotten four hours of sleep. Drinking coffee past 8 p.m. was never a good idea, and having a cup at 9:30 p.m. to help calm his nerves was, in hindsight, an awful decision. With the biggest day of his life staring him in the face, Joshua should have popped some edibles, put on a movie, and gone to bed at a reasonable hour. Oh well, there was nothing he could do about it now.
He pulled off the blanket slowly and stumbled to the bathroom to relieve his bladder. Maybe that would help him relax.
After what felt like a record-breaking piss, he returned to the bedroom and opened the drapes of his suite on the top floor of the St. Regis hotel, staring at the bright lights of Washington, D.C.
He couldn’t help but wonder what this day, three and a half long years in the making, would bring for him. Joshua had poured his heart and soul into this project, missing first steps, first words and one anniversary with his wife Julie, all for the goal of getting legislation onto President Randolph’s desk for signature.
If that happened, and it was still a big if, Julie and Joshua could confidently say it had all been worth it.
As a result of this goal, he had been in Washington, D.C. for the past three painstaking weeks, which were filled with meetings, late-night sessions, and sleepless nights, all to prepare for his speech today to the Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence, a subset of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law.
His colleague, Neil Jergenson, was more than happy to let Joshua handle the speech and was hopefully sleeping in his suite on the second floor. Given his fear of heights, Neil had suggested Joshua take the suite on the higher floor, which was ironic given how high Neil was all the time.
At the relatively young age of 35, even Joshua found himself physically and mentally exhausted by the end of this three-week stretch. As such, everyone on his team agreed that he should take it easy the day before the speech. So, he had done just that by working out in the morning, eating a lean, healthy breakfast, and reading some books he had packed before his trip from Sydney. After a nap, he ordered a late lunch from room service, watched TV, and practiced his speech.
Julie, their seven-year-old son Owen, and two-year-old daughter Olivia had returned to Sydney weeks ago. The kids needed to get back to school, and Joshua and Julie didn’t want the kids around the media chaos that could follow his speech.
Joshua already missed his family dearly. And his home city of Sydney. He hadn’t spent much time there since they moved to the United States a few years earlier to allow him to perform his research. He eagerly looked forward to returning home after this exhausting process was over.
Julie had been an absolute angel, supporting him through each failure, redesign, subsequent failure, subsequent redesign, and eventual breakthrough. She was the rock of their family, never complaining about the long nights and weekends required of him and always understanding why it was necessary.
He was grateful she was by his side when he received the call that Neil and he were to present their findings to the panel after the huge success of human trials performed earlier in the year.
As he gazed out at the lit-up buildings of downtown Washington, D.C., tears welled in his eyes. He sighed, turned away from the window, and searched for the remote control to turn on the television so he didn’t feel so alone. The local station popped on, with the “really early morning” crew reporting protests in London, which had broken out as a rebuttal to the Church of England’s statement that Artificial Intelligence was against the teachings of the Bible and society should eliminate it in lieu of reverence for God.
“Ah, London,” he thought, sighing deeper than before.
Though he had been to London only a few times, the city held a special place in his heart. Even as a young boy, reading Sherlock Holmes, he had wondered what it would be like to walk the dark and misty streets of London at night.
As a teenager, watching old movies and shows about the Royal Family’s history and majesty made him wonder what it would be like to be a royal, surrounded by people who were privileged and wealthy, yet so stuck in their ways. While traveling the world and being adored by millions of people sounded wonderful, the lack of privacy would surely get old after a while.
However, it was his visit to London in June 2026 that he would never forget, as it changed his life forever.
Lying back in bed, he switched off the television, hoping to get a couple more hours of sleep. “Don’t get yourself worked up, J-Dog,” he muttered out loud, using the nickname he had created when he was very young as a way of fitting in with the cool kids from school. “Stop thinking about London and focus on your breathing. In… out… in… out…”
Yet, breathing didn’t help. His mind kept returning to London, to the raw excitement and hope from that phone call in 2026 that brought him to this very bed in Washington, D.C.
Prior to 2026, Joshua and Julie had been planning a trip to London for many years, starting when they first met in college at the University of Adelaide in 2015. Back then, Joshua was a shy and soft-spoken 20-year-old junior studying computer science on the advanced track, hoped to be part of the generation that took computing technology to the next level.
Growing up as an only child in the middle-class community of Smithfield, in the suburbs of Sydney, he never imagined getting a full scholarship to the university, let alone being accepted into the Australian Institute for Machine Learning program to continue his research into the most advanced computing technologies of the time.
His studies and research took up most of his spare time through the winter holidays of his junior year, when he decided to stay on campus and finalize some of the programs he was working on.
One day in late December 2015, Joshua stopped by his local hangout, the Adelaide Coffee Bar, a few blocks from his apartment. It was there that he first laid eyes on Julie behind the counter.
It was the first time he had seen her there and she was stunning: long blonde hair, crystal blue eyes, and the warmest smile he had ever seen.
When he ordered his coffee and croissant, she greeted him with a friendly, “How are you doing today?” His brain urged him to respond, but his mouth would not follow suit. After several seconds, he managed to say, “I’m good.”
As if that bland response wasn’t embarrassing enough, he spilled his freshly received coffee across the countertop and onto her apron. He wanted to crawl under the counter and die. It was one of the worst moments of his life.
Fighting the temptation to run out of the coffee shop and back to his apartment, never to set eyes on her again, Joshua, returned to his table with a new coffee and croissant, and escaped into his work.
Thirty minutes later Julie approached him, and asked how he was doing. This time, he replied, “Well, I haven’t made a complete ass out of myself in a half hour, so I’d say pretty good.” She shook her head and laughed, which led to a huge sigh of relief from Joshua. He proceeded to learn about her studies in Marine and Wildlife Conversation, her part-time job at the coffee shop to save up for a chance to travel the world visiting the most exotic tropical locations, her love of the ocean, music, dogs, and, of course, London.
It was like the heavens had opened up and dropped down the most perfect woman a mere few hundred meters from where he lived.
This conversation eventually led to a first date, subsequent dates, a relationship, a marriage, a family, and a life together that Joshua could never have imagined when he first walked into that coffee shop years earlier.
After college, Joshua landed an entry-level software development role at a fintech upstart in Sydney, making decent money. At the same time, Julie had just landed her dream job working for the Australian Institute of Science, studying the impact of climate change on the coral reefs around Australia.
They got married in late 2019 and planned a honeymoon in London for the summer of 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic ended any hopes of traveling. Once travel resumed in 2022, they planned another trip to London, only to have it derailed by Julie’s pregnancy with Owen.
Finally, in the summer of 2026, when Owen was three, they decided to take the 30-hour trip from Sydney to Heathrow to visit London together, as a family.
It was an exhausting and stressful trip, with stops at most of the major touristy spots. However, it was the phone call Joshua received while sitting in one of the oldest pubs in London, The Seven Stars in Aldwych, that made it an unforgettable trip.
Before they left Sydney, Joshua had told Julie he wanted to grab a proper “pint” in London, preferably at one of its oldest establishments. While he wasn’t a huge beer enthusiast, this felt like something he should do. Back then, the relatively few times a year he went all-in on his alcohol consumption, it was usually a nice Australian Shiraz or Pinot Noir. Occasionally, he would dabble in bourbon or scotch, mostly when Julie’s parents visited, as her dad had developed a taste for the finer things in life, which included a good bourbon.
On their last day in London, Owen was cranky and tired, so Julie told Joshua to find a pub to have the (hopefully) perfect beer by himself for a few hours.
After some quick research, he saw a pub about a click away called The Seven Stars in Aldwych. According to the website, the pub was built in 1602 and seemed to have all the traditional English pub features: oak floors, wooden beams across the ceiling, and a narrow, steep stairway from the bar area to the second floor. Shakespeare was said to have frequented the bar while working at the Blackfriars Theater, half a mile away.
Funny enough, the owner was Australian and had settled there in the 1970s. It felt like the right place for his perfect beer.
Joshua was feeling down that day as he crossed London Bridge over the River Thames on his way to the pub. The rainy, chilly weather didn’t help his mood but he was just in a general malaise.
Sure, he was happy with Julie and adored little Owen, but his career wasn’t where he’d hoped it would be. In college, he and his friends had talked about how one of them would change the world by creating the next multi-billion-dollar tech conglomerate. Joshua always believed that he would be the one to do it.
While that hadn’t happened yet, Joshua was still regarded as one of Australia’s top code developers. He was working on exciting projects in the fintech space that he hoped would receive some investment soon.
On top of his career concerns, he and Julie had also been arguing more recently. He loved her commitment to her research and respected her greatly, but a lot of the day-to-day care for Owen fell on his shoulders since she had to be out of town for her research.
Joshua loved how his relationship with Owen had blossomed, and he loved spending time with his son, but the mental and physical exhaustion was starting to get to him. Owen missed his mom, and with nightmares recently creeping into his nighttime routine, Joshua was not sleeping well and he found himself taking it out on Julie, making her feel guilty for being away so much.
Joshua disliked the person he was becoming and wished his life had more meaning. That’s why this trip to London seemed perfectly timed—Julie and he both needed family time together, and he had always wanted to explore London and learn more about its history and lore.
So, while his career wasn’t where he ideally wanted it to be, he was enjoying this trip and looking forward to what life had to bring in the coming years. If he only knew how drastically his life was about to change.
When Joshua finally reached the Royal Courts of Justice complex and walked onto tree-lined Carey Street, he was craving a drink. He spotted the small black sign of the Seven Stars bar ahead and headed inside.
It was smaller than he had imagined but cozy, with many old posters and photos on the purple walls. Clearly, the owner was fond of cats, evident from the dominating cat-themed decorations.
The bar area was small, but given it was the middle of the afternoon, it was fairly empty, so he went right up to the bar to place his order. While the beer selection was above average, he went with a traditional Guinness and a beef and potato pie. As he ordered, he felt bad for the hotel room toilet later in the day.
There were stairs to the left of the bar that went up to the second floor, which he decided to quickly check out after clearing it with the bartender.
Upstairs, he found more cat photos, old movie posters, and a small kitchen where something was sizzling in the fryer. It was unlike any bar he had ever been in—the kind he would have likely hung out in if he were a local: quaint, simple, and homely.
Returning downstairs, he sat at a small table by the window with his beer. Looking outside, he thought about the people who frequented this pub throughout the centuries. If only the walls could speak, they would surely have amazing tales to tell.
After a short wait, he received his meal and quickly downed it as he was famished. He ordered another couple of Guinness and checked on Julie and Owen, knowing Owen usually woke up from his nap by late-afternoon.
As he settled his bill, his cellphone lit up with a private number. Normally, he would let such calls go to right to voicemail, but something in him told him to answer. So, he did.
Five minutes later, after a conversation with a gentleman from the United States Division of Health, he knew he needed to get back to the hotel right away to speak to Julie. He had just been scheduled to fly to Washington, D.C., in a week to meet with leaders of something called the Anticipation Day Task Force, which was apparently creating some sort of new simulation experience for citizens of the United States.
Joshua had been selected to join the Task Force by someone within the United States government, although the caller did not say how or why Joshua was chosen. Many questions flooded his mind:
Why him? What would this mean for him and his family’s lives? Would they now have to consider moving to the United States? What the fuck was an Anticipation Day Task Force? What would people be anticipating?
He hurried through London’s crowded streets, feeling a strong buzz from the combination of the beer and the recent phone call. Passing St. Paul’s Cathedral, he stopped on London Bridge to take a few deep breaths and revel in his feelings. The universe seemed to have sensed what was missing from his life and instantly delivered the one absent ingredient: meaning.
It felt like his childhood dream had come true, and he was now in a James Bond movie.
He returned to the hotel and told Julie they needed to talk. It was a brief conversation, as Owen was begging for Joshua’s attention, but Joshua was able to summarize the phone call for her.
While Julie needed time to process the news, as always, she promised to support him, even if it meant finding more help for Owen or working closer to home.
They had no idea what “supporting him” would ultimately entail.
The sound of police sirens outside Joshua’s Washington, D.C., hotel room window interrupted his thoughts. He checked the time with Sylvia: 5:15 a.m. Realizing he needed a couple more hours of sleep, he knew only one thing could relax him enough to put him out.
The one good thing about Julie and the kids leaving was having a huge hotel suite all to himself.
He grabbed his tablet, scrolled to his favorite adult entertainment website, and eight minutes later, he was out like a light.
The extra 80 minutes of sleep boosted him enough to jump out of bed and into the shower when his alarm went off at 6:45 a.m.
The water pressure was so satisfying that he lingered under the hot stream for a bit, rehearsing the opening lines of his speech. He wanted to ensure he got the speech off to a strong start. While Joshua considered himself a decent public speaker and would have the speech there in front of him, addressing a Senate committee was on a different level. Not many people could prepare for the attention such a meeting would generate.
With the Senators, the media expected in the room, and the audience of hundreds that would be behind him, he half-considered wearing a diaper in case he shit himself. His only goal was to meet the Senators’ eyes and project confidence, allowing them to see the intensity in his eyes and hear the passion in his voice, so they knew he truly believed in this technology. Getting the speech off on the right foot was important, so he practiced it until it became ingrained in his memory.
As he finished showering and got dressed, he couldn’t help but think of how grateful he was to his family for their support on the long road it took to get to where he was today.
Once Joshua and Julie realized they would have to move to the United States, Julie’s mom decided to accompany them to help with Owen and household chores. The US government also funded a part-time nanny, providing plenty of support for Owen and allowing Julie to secure a research position at the University of Delaware, to advance her own research.
They settled in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, a quiet and beautiful community situated between Washington, D.C., and Boston. This location allowed Joshua to fly out of Dover Air Force Base, about an hour away.
Joshua needed to split his time between meetings in Washington, D.C., and several leading artificial intelligence research institutions, including MIT, Harvard, Columbia University, Stanford, and the University of California, Berkeley. There, he worked with top researchers and the most advanced technology to expedite the program safely and swiftly.
Consequently, he spent only one week per month at home, which he requested as part of the government deal in order to spend time with his family.
Besides the family support, Joshua appreciated how lucky he was to have been chosen for this position in the first place. As it turned out, Danny Gonzales, a colleague of Dr. Claudine Shanley, the head of the Task Force, was visiting his sister at the University of Adelaide in the spring of 2026 and had happened to sit in on a panel on artificial intelligence that Joshua had led. The panel’s topic was how artificial intelligence could lead to the development of simulated worlds, and Joshua had discussed the technological and ethical dilemmas of developing alternate realities.
While it was a great panel, the reality was anyone else with a similar background could have been chosen to be a part of this amazing and life-changing process.
Joshua’s 7:30 a.m. alarm to meet Neil downstairs jolted him back to his current reality. He checked his appearance in the mirror to make sure his salt-and-pepper hair looked as good as possible, his tie was as straight as could be and no remnants of last night’s chicken dinner were stuck in his teeth.
He went downstairs to the hotel lobby, ordered a kale, apple, and carrot concoction to calm his nerves, and popped two prescription scopolamine to control his nausea.
Seated with his drink, waiting, as usual, for his colleague and research partner, Neil Jergenson, to meet him in the lobby for the ride over to the US Capital, he took some more time to reflect, this time on the insane journey the two of them had been on since their first meeting in the fall of 2026.
If they knew the trials, tribulations, failures, and significant graying of their hair it would take to get to this point, Joshua was certain they would still do it all over again.
Joshua knew Neil was the right man for the job the moment he met him at the Black Sheep bar in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in September 2026. At first, he wondered whether Neil was old enough to drink legally; he had no facial hair, wore glasses, and had a voice that reminded Joshua of Screech from Saved by the Bell (Joshua loved cheesy 1990s sitcoms).
Alas, Neil was old enough to order a beer and turned out to be one of the most intelligent people Joshua had ever encountered, even at the tender age of 25.
Neil was an up-and-coming computer scientist who had recently graduated from the Schwarzman College of Computing at MIT. He was in his second year of research at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), focusing on visual computing.
They spent hours at the bar discussing the government’s request. Neil was intrigued by the technological aspect, bringing up concepts like mind interfaces and implants, duplicating neural connections in the brain, downloading consciousness onto silicon-based devices to arrive at a theoretical Simulation Point, and running ancestral simulations.
Neil mentioned that CSAIL was already working on a smaller-scale project whereby humans could experience a full-scale simulation experience of a specific era within a pod. However, the simulation was limited to a made-up world, with an inability to fully engage all five senses. He was also aware of some private companies that had developed in-home gadgets to create a simulated world, but he hadn’t personally tried them as they were costly.
With recent advances in quantum and neuromorphic computing, time dilation technology, reinforcement learning, and generative adversarial networks, they agreed that this could be accomplished relatively quickly with proper financial and regulatory support.
So, Neil came on board with an enthusiasm that was tough to match. Eventually, the Task Force funded hundreds of millions of dollars for securing computer and server equipment, hiring personnel to develop, secure, and test the technology, renting out facilities to administer the experiences, and analyzing the program’s impact on the economy and society as a whole.
Over the next six months, Neil and Joshua worked closely with their academic research teams to develop a safe and efficient method for delivering this experience to the public.
While they were involved on the technical side of things, Joshua led all meetings with the Task Force and over 150 government agencies that were involved with the process—an amount he felt was about 50% too many. Unfortunately, this involved many painful and contentious meetings with government officials, lunch and dinner meetings with countless lobbyist groups, late-night meetings with government contractors located in Europe, and 6 a.m. meetings with government contractors in India, Vietnam, and other Asian countries.
The Task Force meetings were much more pleasant, with all the leaders focused on delivering this project as quickly and safely as possible. Joshua led the technological development, which was the most important one, given that if the technology didn’t work safely and effectively, the rest of the mission would be rendered useless.
Other leaders on the force were tasked with sourcing data for the simulations, setting regulations around physical and mental health monitoring, sourcing and developing necessary hardware, recruiting test subjects, and overseeing many other changes within the Labor Department, Treasury Department, and the Justice Department, amongst others.
For Joshua and Neil, it was a lot of pressure to deliver something that not only worked, but worked so well that it would leave every participant wanting more. A lot more.
So, they were practically tied to the hip, except during Joshua’s meetings with government officials, dinners, or Sundays—their day off. For Joshua, Sundays were dedicated to his family so they could enjoy peaceful walks on the beach, watch movies, or simply spend time together at home. These days were essential for him to help recharge the batteries.
Their hard work paid off in April 2027 when the approval for testing research animals was received, primarily to ensure the chip implants didn’t impact brain activity or functions, and confirming there were no immediate issues requiring correction before the use of human subjects.
By late August 2027, as they entered a wait-and-see mode, Joshua and Julie took the family back to Australia to wait for the testing to move the process along. This was a refreshing break to spend time with their families, as they hadn’t seen each other in nearly a year.
Unexpectedly, this trip turned out to be quite productive as, in September 2027, Julie discovered she was pregnant again, which certainly threw a wrench into their plans. When they found out it was a girl, Julie expressed happiness since she had always wanted a little girl, leading them both to view it as a blessing.
Julie gave birth to Olivia in June 2028, just as the technology received final approvals for human testing following successful animal trials.
After much discussion, Joshua and Julie decided that he should return to the United States alone. Being away from their extended families with the two little ones would be too difficult, especially since Joshua was going to be traveling so much for work that he wouldn’t be home much anyway. It was a tough decision for him, but ultimately the right one.
His first official speech was delivered in August 2028 to the Committee on the Use of Humans as Experimental Subjects (COUHES) at MIT. He summarized the technology, its anticipated use, pre-and post-study monitoring of the human subjects, and the duration of the testing.
He received many questions regarding the potential physical and psychological impacts of this technology on subjects, as well as its ethical implications for society.
Luckily, his team had prepared for these questions and focused the committee on several important points:
The human subjects could select the time and location of their simulation, provided sufficient historical information existed for accurate recreation. This allowed subjects to mentally prepare for the world they were being transported to and what physical and emotional challenges they would expect. One of the key theories of this program was that the subjects’ experience with their simulation would positively impact the subjects’ emotional and mental well-being, even if the simulation itself was a stressful or negative experience.
Subjects had the option to change their simulation every year, so they would have the ability to learn and experience various simulations throughout their natural lifetime.
The human subjects would be constantly monitored, and they could terminate the simulation at any time, particularly if they felt emotionally unstable or uncomfortable, or if real-word events required their immediate withdrawal from the simulation.
The chip implant technology used as a link from the computers simulating the subjects’ neuropathways used materials with minimal long-term health risks, validated through prior testing on animal subjects. Similarly, the ring device being utilized during the simulation posed no significant long-term risks to the patient.
The subjects would be monitored post-experience, both physically and mentally, to ensure any negative impacts are fully documented and addressed with appropriate medical attention.
Fortunately, the committee agreed, and human research proceeded in the fall of 2028. Forty machines were set up across MIT to conduct over 5,000 simulations, which were expected to take three to four months to complete.
For these tests, each subject would have two simulations run. The first would have the participant choose a historical period from three options provided. In the second simulation, they would choose a specific day from their lives to relive, requiring a separate download of their memories onto a secure drive stored on double-encrypted servers in a government-secured facility.
By January 2029, after completing their final test run and reviewing the favorable survey results, they knew they had accomplished nothing short of staggering.
While Joshua and Neil knew the next step was to convince governmental regulators that this would benefit society, they believed the data was unmistakable and irrefutable.
Over the following year, they monitored the subjects for any long-term negative side effects; with fewer than 1% reporting any such effects.
During this period, the Task Force nominated Neil and Joshua to present the results of this test to the newly formed Senate Committee on Artificial Intelligence, which comprised several influential senators. Approval by this committee almost guaranteed bill passage in the Senate. With Republicans leading the House of Representatives and a centrist Republican in the White House, there was not much to stop the bill from becoming law if this committee approved it.
In February 2030, Joshua and Neil were ready to present to the committee, which brought them to Washington for this morning’s presentation.
As Joshua took a final drink of his juice, he heard Neil’s voice behind him say, “Good morning, fine sir. Are you ready for this?”
Joshua snapped out of his third trip down memory lane this morning, stood up, and shook Neil’s hand. “As ready as I’ll ever be. I slept like shit, but I don’t think I was expecting anything else.”
Neil quickly replied, “You and me both, but for different reasons. I had to kick that waitress from that Italian restaurant down the street out of my hotel room around midnight, but man, what a ride, if you know what I mean.” He winked at Joshua.
Neil had gotten divorced a few months ago and seemed to be enjoying the single life.
“I don’t know what you mean, but yeah, she was cute. Glad you enjoyed your night,” Joshua said with a smile.
“Well, Bob at Rosenfarb and Craven called. He tried reaching you, but you must have been in the shower or jerking off or something. He wanted you to know that if today’s hearing goes well, Claudine and other Task Force members believe we’ll have enough support in the Senate to push this through quickly. Boom baby!
There’s likely still going to be pushback from religious conservatives, but even some of them can be convinced, given they can go back in time to see Jesus or Abraham or whatever. He also wanted to relay the message, and I quote: ‘Do not fuck this up!’”
Joshua chuckled and looked up before closing his eyes and taking a deep breath. As if he didn’t have enough pressure to get this speech right, now he knew that this really had a chance of continuing to move forward. He felt both excitement and nausea; not only would there be a lot of eyes on his performance today in the room, but half the country was expected to watch this session live. Soon, he would be the face of Anticipation Day, whether he liked it or not.
Neil broke his train of thought, pointing out that their team was waiting outside with the van that would take them to the Capitol.
“Let’s go get ‘em, tiger!” Joshua heard Neil say before they exited the lobby into the cool, sunny day, climbed into the car, and headed toward the Capitol building.
CHAPTER 2
THE TESTIMONY
March 14, 2030
- Capital Building 8:15 a.m.
Neil, Joshua, and their assistants, Magda and Omar, arrived at the Russell Senate Building 45 minutes before the 9 a.m. scheduled start time. As Joshua got out of the car and looked around, he remembered the riots of 2028 that had destroyed some sections of the Capitol area, including parts of the Russell building, requiring renovations and additional security measures both inside and outside the building.
As such, it took them about 15 minutes to fully get through security and enter the Russell Rotunda, where Joshua saw multiple white archways and columns extending from floor to ceiling, the coffered dome looming above, and doorways leading in multiple directions.
For anyone seeing it for the first time, the entryway was imposing.
The team walked upstairs to the Caucus Room, which featured a richly detailed ceiling highlighted with gold leaves, twelve giant Corinthian columns, and a multitude of pilasters that had to be over two stories high. There were mahogany benches scattered throughout the room and one large chandelier in the center, which was surrounded by four smaller chandeliers, providing ample lighting.
The room appeared to be about half full, with a few people putting the final touches on the seating and refreshments. A small table was set up in front of an elevated platform that housed a larger table to seat the eleven senators who made up the Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence, along with seats for aids and assistants.
Between the elevated platform and the smaller table, the members of the press attending the hearing were mulling about.
On the floor, there had to be a couple of hundred seats arranged for other attendees, including family, friends, and colleagues of Joshua and Neil, as well as assistants and other guests invited by the subcommittee. Two microphones and a pitcher with glasses, likely filled with water but which Joshua secretly hoped would be tequila to calm his nerves, were on the table.
Neil commented that he was going for a bathroom break. Joshua thought he should too, but before he could turn around to head to the restroom, he heard a familiar voice: “Hey Josh!”
He wheeled around and saw his old classmate, Chris Harbinger, from the University of Adelaide, walking toward him.
“Chris! What on earth brings you here, mate?” Joshua exclaimed, hugging his old junior-year friend.
“Hey man, I wouldn’t miss this—you know that! I’m close to Marily Vazquez, and she invited me. She said you were awesome to work with. Looks like this process has grayed you a bit, huh?” Chris said, grinning.
Joshua smiled back. “Yeah, mate. It’s been a few long years working on this. How the hell are you?”
“Yeah, the wife and I decided to get out of Sydney a few years ago. She got an opportunity to work for American University, so I applied for contracting work with the Department of Defense. I’ve been there ever since, doing cybersecurity work. Gotta keep the bastards in the US government honest on some level. But I’m loving it here. We moved to northern Virginia last year so the kids could have a bigger backyard.” Chris paused, looking at Joshua. “Crikey, man, it’s been so long; it’s great to see you! I heard you were doing this presentation and had to find you to congratulate you on whatever world-changing invention you’ve created.”
Joshua felt his Australian slang returning after just these few minutes with Chris. “Goodonya, mate, I’m really happy for you. I had no idea you were here. We lived up in Delaware for a bit before Julie got pregnant with Olivia. She stayed back in Sydney while I finished this roadshow. I wish I’d known you were here, but honestly, I was so busy that it would have been tough to get together. Now that I know, let’s catch up after this meeting, okay? You were always a larrikin, but having you here with me means a lot. I gotta take a piss and get ready for this thing. Good seeing you. Find me after the hearing, won’t ya?”
“Reckon, mate, good luck with this speech… come here!” Chris pulled Joshua in for another tight hug. “Go piss and give ’em hell!”
“Thanks, Chris. Good seeing you.” Joshua turned and headed to the restrooms outside. Chris was a fun time back in college, and their brief conversation calmed Joshua down a bit.
After taking care of business and ensuring he looked presentable, Joshua returned to the room, which was now mostly full. He recognized some familiar faces—colleagues of Neil and other folks he had met at MIT, Harvard, and other colleges during their travails over the past couple of years.
He saw Danny Gonzales, whose recommendation to Claudine Shanley started this process years earlier. Joshua went over to say hello, shook his hand, and then sat at the table to review his speech for what felt like the 4,721st time. Unfortunately, Claudine wasn’t at the meeting as she was recovering from back surgery a few weeks earlier. However, they had spoken the day before, and she had wished him good luck and told him how proud she was.
He spent the next ten minutes scanning the speech to ensure he could recite most of the beginning by heart.
Finally, around 9:00 a.m., an announcement was made: “The meeting of the Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence will commence in ten minutes.”
Joshua stood, stretched, and saw Neil, Omar and Magda walking towards him, all engaging in small talk with one of his old colleagues. Eventually, Omar and Magda took their seats behind Joshua while Neil sat next to him at the table, giving him a slight nod that said: You got this.
At exactly 9:10 a.m., the rear doors closed, and everyone was asked to take their seats. Doors on the side of the room opened, and the eleven senators and their aides began to enter.
The cameras flashed rapidly as the Senators walked in. Joshua recognized their faces immediately from preparation meetings with his team. There was:
Senator Marsha Johnson (R) from New York, Chairwoman
Senator Alberto Guiterrez (R) from Florida, Ranking Member
Senator Harlan Connelly (R) from South Carolina
Senator Chris Donogue (D) from Massachusetts
Senator Kyle Drummond (R) from Colorado
Senator Diane Fielding (R) from Wyoming
Senator Jane French (D) from New Jersey
Senator Jack Hughes (D) from Florida
Senator Robert Mulligan (R) from Arizona
Senator Michael Smith (D) from Minnesota
Senator Robin Tuttle (D) from Virginia
As they sat down in their seats, Senator Johnson took a sip of water, adjusted her microphone, shuffled some papers in front of her, and prepared to give her welcoming remarks.
“Good morning. The hearing will come to order.
I want to thank everyone for being here, especially those of you who traveled a great distance to attend this 22nd meeting of the Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence. Thanks to the Ranking Member and his team for working with us to organize this hearing.
Artificial intelligence is one of the key issues of our time. Its development and implementation is causing, and will continue to cause, significant changes in healthcare, entertainment, the environment, the economy and the way we interact with each other. The very concept of artificial intelligence will challenge our definition of what it means to be ‘human.’
Over the past few years, technological advances have increased fivefold due to breakthroughs in computing power and chip technologies. These advances raise concerns about the impact of this technology on everything from privacy and surveillance bias and discrimination to our physical and mental well-being. The questions of regulation and compliance are something this committee has taken very seriously throughout its three and a half years of existence.
However, we have never faced a proposal like the one before us today. If this proposal becomes law, it will result in a full transformation of American society. Therefore, no one on this panel, whether Republican or Democrat, should take this responsibility lightly.
As Stan Lee once said, ‘With great power comes great responsibility.’ Our task is to ensure that if the government grants the power of a full-scale simulation to each eligible citizen, it is delivered safely, securely, and methodically, and monitored in a responsible and consistent way. This will ensure the long-term implications are properly understood and addressed.
As Shakespeare said, ‘We know what we are, but know not what we may be.’ All the members of this panel aim to ensure that what we may become in these simulations does not impact what we are as human beings in the real world.
Today, we are here to discuss the results of the technology developed over the past several years to support Bill S1042, sponsored by Senators Mary Childs and Tom Barrows. This bill, introduced last year, proposes to legalize an annual simulated experience for eligible citizens of the United States. The Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law assigned this bill to the current committee.
I welcome the insights of Doctors Joshua Lee and Neil Jergenson, who have led the development of this technology. They are here to present their findings to this panel. With that, I turn to the Ranking Member, Senator Guiterrez.”
Joshua’s eyes drifted to his right, where Senator Guiterrez was sitting.
“Thank you, Senator Johnson, and to the expert witnesses for being here with us today.
I cannot think of a more important issue for this panel to discuss than what appears to be a full-scale government-backed takeover of the human mind, for what you say will lead to a happier society. While that sounds idealistic in theory, my Republican colleagues and I have significant concerns about the security, practicality, and moral implications of this rollout.
How can we honestly guarantee positive outcomes for everyone entering these simulations? The mere suggestion to let human beings choose another world to live in for a predetermined period, experience the realness and intensity of that world, and even possibly die in that world leads me to believe this technology is not ready for real-world deployment. We lack a full understanding of this technology’s long-term implications for the average American’s psyche.
I want to ensure this does not fall into the same category as other failed social experiments like Winthrop Kellogg’s Ape, or the Stanford Prison Experiment. Far too many lives are on the line here.
While I appreciate the longing to lead a different life—trust me, I, too, would love to be an astronaut on Mars for a month—the reality is that my real life lies here on Earth. I owe it to the people of Florida and throughout the country, to fully vet and challenge this initiative before I vote to move it forward for consideration.
I hope this committee can maintain a balanced approach, ensuring this technology is secure, safe, and monitorable before making it available to the American public. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today. Thank you, Chairman, for scheduling this committee.”
Chairman Johnson cleared her throat and continued, “Thank you, Ranking Member Guiterrez. Let’s begin with our witness introductions.
Our first witness today is Joshua Lee, lead scientist and researcher for the Anticipation Day Task Force. He is a graduate of the University of Adelaide and a recognized affiliate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, and Brown University.
We’ll start with Mr. Lee’s statement. Please aim to stay within 30 minutes; we will not use the gavel for a slight overrun, but if you exceed five minutes, I will have to remind you of the limit. Thank you for your cooperation. Mr. Lee, over to you.” Chairman Johnson set down her microphone, and the room fell silent.
Joshua took a deep breath, quickly sipped some water, and resisted an urge to release a huge fart. After glancing at Neil beside him and checking his notes for the last time, he looked back up at the eleven senators. “Here goes nothing,” he thought.
“Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Gutierrez, distinguished Committee members, and staff members who made today possible, thank you for the opportunity to discuss the findings of our Task Force. We believe that these results hold far-reaching implications for our society going forward. I extend my gratitude to the Task Force for giving me the honor of being here today, especially Dr. Claudine Shanley, who has been both a mentor and friend.
My name is Joshua Lee, lead researcher on this project, which has been the passion of both my colleague and friend, Neil Jergenson, and myself for the past three and a half years.
I vividly recall the day in London in the summer of 2026 when I received a call from a man I had never spoken to before who told me that I had been handpicked to join a new task force which had been created to develop a transformative simulation experience for every eligible American citizen.
As soon as I hung up, I knew my life was about to change, but I could not have imagined how much.
With the support of my family, we moved to America to begin a three and a half year journey that has led us here today. From the beginning, the primary goal of my team and the rest of the Task Force was to ensure the technology we developed was applied safely and securely. Secondarily, we aimed to develop an experience so lifelike that it would transform the lives of whomever experienced it.
Neil and I tirelessly worked on developing, testing, and securing this technology to interface with our neurological and nervous systems to facilitate a seamless and safe transition between the real and simulated worlds.
We have conducted over 10,000 simulations, with results that speak for themselves, as I will discuss shortly.
But before I do this, I have a simple request for each member of the Committee: please indulge me for a moment.” Joshua paused for a second before continuing.
“Close your eyes and try to tune out any noise in this room. I promise I won’t pelt you with anything, but I can’t vouch for other folks here.” Laughter broke out in the room as Joshua grinned at the line he had incorporated the previous night.
After exchanging brief glances, the Committee members smiled and eventually closed their eyes, relaxing.
“Thank you for indulging me. Now with your eyes closed, take a few deep breaths, relax and calm yourself.”
He waited a moment. “I hope everyone is there. Now, I want you to picture a place. It could be a town, a city, a house, a beach, a lake, a national park you’ve been to, or any other place that lives in your mind’s eye. This place doesn’t necessarily need to hold special meaning for you, but it should bring you some level of peace and happiness. Have you found your place?
Now that you’ve found your place, pick a year. Any year—it doesn’t matter. It can be this year, or you can go back millions of years, even to the time of the dinosaurs. Okay? Have your year?”
The room was mostly silent.
“Good. Now, picture yourself in this time and place and think about what you see: Are there people? What are they wearing? Do people even exist yet? Is this a natural setting? What surrounds you? Trees, oceans, mountains, forests? Are there animals? If so, what are they doing? Take a moment to truly see and feel this place.”
Joshua glanced up at the Senators, who appeared deep in thought and, importantly, calm.
“Think about what you can hear. If people are nearby, are they talking? What are they talking about? Are there cars or other vehicles? Are there natural sounds, like the wind, rain, or animals? Take a moment to imagine the sounds in this place.
Now, think about what you can smell. Are there people who smell? What do they smell like? Are the smells pleasant? Foul? A mix of both? Are there smells from cars, trucks, or other man-made objects? If you’re outside, what do you smell from the natural world around you? Perhaps the salty air near the ocean or the sweet, fruity, or musky fragrance of flowers. Take your time to breathe in the various scents of your chosen place.”
Joshua paused for effect.
“Next, think about what you can touch. Are you indoors, where you can feel objects like tables or chairs? Are you in a city with cars or buildings that you can touch? Or are you outside in the wilderness, able to touch trees, water, or grass? Can you feel a person’s skin? Think about what and who you can touch in this place.
Finally, think about what you can taste. Think about the local cuisine, if there is one. Is it something you have eaten before? What is the texture of the food and the drinks? Imagine those flavors on your tongue. I sense some of you are hungry; I can hear your stomachs growling.”
A few chuckles arose from the crowd. Joshua quieted his voice.
“Keep your eyes closed for a moment and picture yourself exploring this place in your mind—whether for a day, a week, a month, or a year. What things would you find? What people would you meet? What sights would you see? What food would you eat? What thoughts and emotions would you have about being in this time and place? Hold those thoughts for a moment, please.”
There was complete silence in the room, interrupted by the occasional click of a camera shutter or the shuffle of shoes on the marble floors.
He counted to ten.
“Thank you. Please open your eyes.” The Senators opened their eyes looking relaxed.
“Think about what you are feeling right now. Happiness? Positivity? Peace? If I offered you the chance to visit this place once a year, or any other place of your choice, what would you feel? Hopeful? Less stressed?”
He took a moment before saying the next word.
“Anticipation?
Think about that word: anticipation. Are you anticipating being able to experience this time and place one day? To live whatever life you desire? To experience a whole new world free from the stress, drama, and repercussions of your current life? Forget, just for a moment, your political affiliation, race, sex, religion, or lack thereof, or the people you represent.
Each one of us knows the pleasure of anticipating something. Whether it is a favorite restaurant meal, knowing you and your partner are about to make love, or seeing a live performance of your favorite sports team or artist, that feeling of anticipation is one of the most powerful emotions we can have as humans. It makes us appreciate being alive and everything life has to offer.
Would it surprise you to learn that anticipation releases dopamine, resulting in a decrease in negative or painful feelings along with increased arousal and excitement?
What if you could harness that sense of anticipation for the entire year?” Joshua emphasized the word “entire.”
“Imagine anticipating a positive, uplifting event every day for the rest of your life. After experiencing this technology, we believe every human being will anticipate these experiences every year for the rest of their lives and will strongly incentivize them to meet the program’s eligibility requirements around physical and mental well-being, criminal activity, citizenship, and more. It is why this program was named Anticipation Day.
As I mentioned, our simulations will allow participants to revisit any historical period supported by recorded facts and figures. The technology will develop an entire world, which will be loaded onto dissolvable chips implanted safely and painlessly in human subjects. These chips store multiple petabytes of data sourced from over three trillion historical records—governmental, academic, and others. These data sources allow us to recreate how a Great Pyramids builder would have lived their life or what a Mt. Everest climber would go through second by second.
Any period in recorded or scientific history is available for every citizen to choose from. However, spiritual texts such as the Bible, Torah, and Quran require separate consideration and agreement on how certain historical religious events would be portrayed in the simulation. For example, there is no scientific proof of Jesus’ resurrection and walking on water, but it could be recreated in a simulation based on the descriptions in the Bible.
Theoretically, we can simulate any purported historical event, regardless of scientific backing. Who’s to say we can restrict people’s curiosity to see how Noah built his ark, even if there is no proof it happened as depicted in the Bible?
We understand these are sensitive areas requiring further consideration and we look forward to those conversations.”
Joshua turned a page of his report and took a quick sip of water. He should have worn a damn diaper.
“One exciting area of development in the field of neuroscience technology that Neil and I are most proud of is its ability to recreate a specific day from a person’s life.
These simulations will be based on a download of memories obtained from the human subject in order to recreate any chosen day that is supported by actual memories. Yes, we can do this.
Think about the ability to relive a day with a loved one who has passed away or revisit an amazing trip with your best friend after college. Senator Mulligan, you could even go back and experience that high school football championship game again,” he said, prompting a few chuckles around the room. Senator Mulligan smiled at him, nodding subtly.
“I’ve got ‘em,” Joshua thought.
“We feel this option will greatly benefit individuals who may want a more familiar and personalized experience.
Our technology is powered by a network of supercomputers with 1 million petaflops of computing speed. A petaflop can perform one quadrillion, which is ten to the 15th power floating point operations per second. This speed allows us to replicate the human brain’s activities and support approximately 1 million daily simulations.
Due to the amount of energy these servers will demand, more renewable energy sources must be prioritized to avoid overloading current systems. This bill will provide the largest investment in renewable energy in history, with nuclear, hydrogen, geothermal, fusion, wind, solar, and hydropower leading the charge. This bill will also continue our investment in carbon sequestration technology to offset any increase in carbon dioxide emissions due to the program’s rollout.
Our technology will benefit from top-tier cybersecurity programs, with the backing and experience of the most talented cybersecurity experts in the world.
In conclusion, we believe the development of this technology is a remarkable achievement that was unimaginable, even just five years ago. We are immensely grateful to the teams and partners who helped us get to this point. This will transform the life of the average American in ways they can’t imagine.
Now, I will proceed to discuss the results from last year’s trials. As detailed in the materials submitted to you, we selected 10,210 volunteers from a random pool of over 30,000 eligible volunteers aged 18 to 70, with no restrictions based on race, sexual identification or sexual orientation, religious background, or geography.
These volunteers primarily came from specific subsectors of the population, such as government employees, doctors, scientists, and key academic leaders. Additionally, a small percentage of individuals were from the general population, including social media influencers, leaders of Fortune 1000 organizations, and others we believed could effectively advocate for the implementation of this technology.
Each participant obtained clearance from their primary physician and a trained psychiatrist. Furthermore, all subjects signed waivers acknowledging any potential risks associated with the experience.
There were two parts to the trial.
For the first part, 5,105 subjects were presented with three simulation options:
Living in New York City in 1939, during the World’s Fair, as the owner of a pizzeria.
Living in Rome in 1875 as a day trader.
Living in Tibet as a monk in the present time.
Among these, 1,996 chose New York City in 1939, 2,126 chose Rome in 1875, and 983 opted for Tibet as a monk.
The subjects could also choose to be in the simulation for what would feel like one week, one month, or one year. 2,797 chose one week, 1,798 chose one month, and the remaining 510 selected one year. We expected some hesitancy among participants to choose longer times due to the newness of this experience.
To clarify, regardless of the chosen duration, the actual simulation lasted approximately seven hours in real life.
After completing the simulation, the subjects were asked to give detailed feedback on four specific questions about their experience:
Was the experience positive or negative?
Would they have this experience again?
Would they prefer a shorter or longer duration for future simulations?
Would they recommend this experience to others?
We also asked a series of questions regarding their physical, emotional, and mental well-being before and after the simulation to ensure it did not impact their capacities.
From the trial’s subjects, an astounding 99.6% said they would absolutely or likely want to do the simulation again, with over 92% rating the experience as positive. The 8% who found it negative all ended the simulation early. Most of them mentioned they didn’t enjoy the simulation they chose but would try a different scenario again. We believe this issue will be rectified by allowing participants to choose their own time and place upon implementation.
Another interesting finding was that over 93% of the subjects said they would choose a longer period, for example going from a week to a month, or one month to two months, etc. Among the 7% who said they would prefer a shorter time, most had chosen to experience a year and found it too long to feel like they were away from their real lives.
A remarkable 98% of participants recommended others go through this experience, while the remaining 2% were unsure. No one, I repeat, not a single individual suggested others not to experience this. We believe this validates our position that participants felt safe and enjoyed their overall experiences.
For the second part of the experiment, a separate group of 5,105 subjects was chosen to relive a day from their past. This required a download of their memories to find the chosen day.
The subjects were briefed on the simulation and the fact that the day would be relived based on how they remembered it, not necessarily how it actually happened. This simulation, of course, would feel like it lasted 24 hours. In the future, should this legislation be approved, we may look to increase the duration of the simulation, which would require the recall of additional memories.
Again, 96% of the subjects reported it as a positive experience with this part of the trial. This is understandable, given that the day they chose likely brought back warm and happy memories.
73% of the subjects chose a day to see a deceased loved one, while 15% picked a day to relive an accomplishment, such as winning a sports championship or spending a good day with their family. The remaining 12% selected a day to relive an experience with an ex-lover or friend they no longer spoke to.
97% of participants would recommend this experience to others, as even if the day they chose didn’t bring back positive emotions, the experience itself was positive.
As you can see, the vast majority of subjects in both experiments had a positive experience, would proceed with the simulation again, and would do so for a longer period.”
Joshua quickly looked at Neil, who gave him a thumbs-up.
“Now, on to the participants’ physical and mental health. We asked the subjects a series of questions, which you can find in our submitted research papers, about their mental health before and after the simulation.
What emotions did they feel? Did they feel depressed? Did the simulation experience cause any confusion after it was over?
One key component of the simulation is that the memories from the simulation stay with the participant, like a dream. Most participants could remember a good portion of the details of the simulation, but the longer the simulation went on, the fewer specifics they could recall from the entire simulation, similar to real life.
As Dr. Jergenson and I have each done two simulations ourselves, we can confidently say that the detail you see in the simulation is as real as anything you experience daily.
However, we recognize that even if participants report a good experience, they still require monitoring for any potential threat of depression or anger, which could lead to self-harm or harm to others. This would be counterintuitive to what we are trying to achieve. Therefore, we steadfastly support continuous physical and mental monitoring post-simulation to identify and rectify any significant negative side effects immediately.
From a physical well-being standpoint, we monitored significant vital signs during the simulation, such as body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. We also tracked brain activity during the simulation to ensure it remained within normal levels. The simulation mimics the third stage of the sleep cycle, the deepest stage, where heart rate and respiratory rates are at their lowest and muscles are fully relaxed. This allowed subjects to wake up feeling rested and refreshed, allowing them to recall their simulations as much as possible afterward.
Of the 10,210 subjects, only 98 developed negative physical conditions post-simulation. These included 30 heart-related issues, 22 cancer diagnoses, and the remaining cases of various other illnesses. All the cases were eventually determined to be unrelated to anything from the simulation. Currently, 21 of the cancer patients are either receiving treatment or are in remission. Unfortunately, one individual developed pancreatic cancer and passed away earlier this year, but this was not related to the simulation experience.
From a mental well-being standpoint, we required monthly check-ups for every participant to monitor their mental health post-simulation. When negative mental conditions arose —conditions that would normally require medical or psychological follow-up with a trained professional—we conducted full follow-ups with the subject’s primary physician or a certified psychiatrist to ensure the root cause was identified and treated.
Of the 10,210 subjects, 224, or 2.2%, had negative mental conditions post-simulation with 128 related to depression, 68 to anxiety, and 28 to other non-life-threatening mental conditions.
Among the 128 depression cases, we spent significant time with the subjects to determine whether they had a history of depression prior to entering the simulation. Medical records and subsequent interviews revealed that 84 of these subjects had a family history of depression, while the remaining 44 did not. Of these 44 without family history, 32 did not believe the simulation caused their depression, whereas 12 believed the simulation was a factor. That equates to 0.12% of the total subjects for the trial.
Of these 12 cases that believed the simulation was a factor in their depression, eight had symptoms alleviated within 12 weeks after the simulation, and the remaining four within 24 weeks.
Notably, 72% of the depression cases were related to the second experiment, where the participants relived a day in their lives, which we attributed to the fact that it evoked memories of someone from their past, such as a relative or friend that had passed or an ex-lover that got away, for example.
The remaining 28% who experienced depression from the first experiment attributed their symptoms to the overall sad environment they witnessed or other miscellaneous reasons.
The Task Force worked very closely with all cases of negative mental conditions to ascertain whether the simulation may have caused or led to the condition and to ensure ongoing monitoring of these subjects. We have not found any direct link between the simulation experience and any long-term mental issues. To repeat, we have not found any direct link between the simulation experience and any long-term mental issues.
This conclusion was verified by the International Psychotherapy Institute and the American Psychiatric Association. The Task Force has teamed up with these and other organizations to accurately and consistently monitor the subjects post-simulation, especially those at higher risk of depression, anxiety, or other negative mental conditions.
We have received opinion letters from the American Psychiatric Association, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the Depression and Bipolar Alliance, the American Mental Health Counselors Association, and others. These letters support our position that the simulations do not appear to pose a mental health risk to the average American. They recommend that monthly or quarterly check-ups be a required part of this legislation.
You will find these opinion letters in your materials.
The Task Force expects a reduction in negative mental conditions after proper preparation and guidance. Our analysis shows that the percentage of subjects that had a negative mental condition post-simulation is consistent with the overall population, confirming our believe that the simulations would not result in any uptick in the overall depression rate nationwide.
With all that said, we do understand that the intensity of the experience may cause emotions the subjects are not used to feeling. Consequently, we will continue working with public and private institutions to ensure that future subjects are properly monitored and update guidance accordingly.
The Task Force is also proposing a two-to-three-hour monitoring period directly after the simulation, overseen by trained doctors and psychiatrists, to ensure each patient is tracked for potential negative conditions.
All subjects underwent at least two hours of monitoring post-experiment. Only 114 subjects were kept longer than the required two-hour ‘cool down’ period, with 28 of them hospitalized overnight and 14 admitted for a longer period of time for further observation.
All those kept longer were discharged within two weeks, only after receiving clearance from certified physicians and mental health experts who reviewed their reports and determined they posed no harm to themselves or others.
Once individuals could see someone familiar, like a relative, significant other, or friend, their symptoms notably diminished or ceased altogether, so the doctors were comfortable with their conclusions.
The Task Force is also recommending monthly or quarterly mental and physical checkups as a requirement for Anticipation Day to ensure all individuals are healthy enough to go through this experience.
Based on an internal analysis provided to you in the submitted materials, we believe that a decrease in overall healthcare costs will significantly outweigh the cost of these periodic checkups, emphasizing preventative healthcare over reactive healthcare.
To conclude, the Task Force believes that these simulations will allow the average American to have something to look forward to in their life. We hope that every law-abiding citizen will be able to experience this.
We firmly believe this will be a transformative experience for society and eagerly look forward to working with the committee and Congress to finalize this once-in-a-lifetime legislation.”
Joshua took a sip of water before continuing.
“Senators, please recall the time and place at the beginning of my speech and the feeling you had when you had your eyes closed, imagining this place of your choosing.
Our hope today is for you to hold on to that feeling. That feeling of happiness. That feeling of peace. That feeling of anticipation. We want to ensure every American can have that same feeling. We believe this will be a positive, transformative, and life-changing experience.
Thank you for your time and we welcome any questions you may have.”
Applause erupted from those seated in the back. Joshua felt a sense of relief wash over him. He had nailed the speech and gotten through it within the allotted time.
He looked to his right at Neil, who patted him on the back, smiled, and said, “You’re the man. Good job.”
Joshua returned Neil’s smile, bracing himself for the question-and-answer portion of the session, which would turn out to be the longest 90 minutes of his life.
CHAPTER 3
THE DECISION
January 15, 2031
Joshua knew he should have worn something lighter. A black shirt and dark brown shorts were not the best choice on a bright sunny day with temperatures already at 33 degrees Celsius by 11 a.m. Sydney time.
“Oh well,” he thought, taking a sip of water and continuing the never-ending task of stripping weeds from his garden. Unfortunately, the past several months after the committee presentation had been filled with meetings with government officials in Washington and New York, meetings with Neil and his team discussing tweaks they would like to make to the software, and a hundred other meetings that he could barely recall. As a result, everything at his home in Australia had taken a back seat.
With Julie focusing on the kids and schooling and maintaining some semblance of organization inside the house, the outside went by the wayside.
Recent storms had left the yard in a mess. The house needed a power wash, and the garden and landscaping needed a good touchup.
It was a simple house with a beautiful backyard that Joshua loved maintaining, filled with dahlias, roses, and jacaranda bushes mixed with a variety of wildflowers. Bottlebrush, whitegum, and sillyoak trees lined his property, creating a stunning spring bloom. Bushes and flowers surrounded the house, extending all around the sides to the front.
Unfortunately, all of this just created a mess on the ground.
Joshua could have hired someone to do this cleanup, but if he was being honest with himself, he found this work zen-like. After the stress and chaos of the past few years, gardening gave him a sense of peace he hadn’t felt in a long time. The sounds of cockatoos and lorikeets whistling in the morning sun relaxed him, and the feeling of the sun on his skin warmed him. Given he was usually stuck inside most days, getting some natural vitamin D felt rejuvenating.
The buzz of the insects around him brought him back to his childhood and his fascination with bees. It made him feel connected to Mother Nature, even if Mother Nature was an absolute bitch sometimes.
So, after returning to Sydney for the holidays in December and finally spending time with his family through the New Year, Joshua was tasked with the unenviable clean-up that awaited outside of his house.
He was up on a ladder, pruning one of the large sillyoak trees while listening to his favorite band, Audiozine, when his virtual assistant, Sylvia, alerted him to an incoming call.
“Joshua, Claudine Shanley is calling. Would you like to answer it?” Sylvia asked in a deadpan voice that sounded like his mom’s.
“Yes, Sylvia,” Joshua replied as his heart started racing.
“Hi, Claudine. How are you doing today?” He asked as the call went through.
“I’m good, Joshua. Dealing with a snowstorm here in D.C. today,” Claudine said from halfway around the globe. Luckily, technology had improved so much that her voice was as clear as if she were sitting next to him in his yard. “How are you?” She asked.
“Oh, I’m okay—just trying to clean up my yard, which looks like the friggin’ Amazon. The one downfall of traveling the world for the past few years is that I haven’t been able to spend much time with my garden. It’s slightly depressing. I’ll get it cleaned up, but it’s going to take a Herculean effort at this point. Anyway, I’m sure you didn’t call to talk about gardening. What’s the good word? What is it, 9 p.m. in Washington?” Joshua asked, wiping his brow and grabbing shade beneath one of his larger acacia trees.
“Yeah, it’s late, but I just got some news I figured you’d want to hear. I hope you’re sitting down in your garden.” Claudine paused, as if waiting for Joshua to confirm.
“I’m not, but should I be?” Joshua’s voice seemed hesitant.
“You definitely should be. So, I just heard from Bob that we have the votes in the Senate, and they’re voting on it on Monday. Barring a nuclear bomb going off in Washington, this should head to the President next week for his signature!” Claudine’s voice was filled with delight, making Joshua smile instantly.
“Holy shit… I do need to sit down,” he slowly replied. “That’s amazing! Does Bob know what the final bill will look like?”
Claudine took a moment to reply, sounding distracted: “Well, from what I heard, after a ton of back-and-forth, it has about 90% of what we were looking for. Over 21 years of age, unless enrolled in the military, have no recent criminal record, a valid government ID, and no psychiatric conditions in the past five years.
The government will cover 50% of the cost of a subject’s memory recall. I think the goal is to keep the fee under $1,000, which should be doable based on what the new vendor is telling us. So, in total, the participants will be responsible for up to $500. It’s not perfect, but that will be a decision they will have to consider themselves.
They agreed to allow people to skip a year if they desired, but two consecutive skips would require them to reapply to join the program.
They were fine with allowing up to a year of simulated time. There was some pushback from a few senators, but based on our results, they were able to get over the hurdle.
Unfortunately, we lost the privacy battle; all simulations will now be recorded and stored. Republicans were adamant about tracking any potential threats as they popped up. It’s Big Brother at its finest, I guess, but we figured that would happen.
They were also persistent about having an emergency cancellation option, but supported our opinion that participants should be able to redo the simulation if a personal emergency requires them to cancel the simulation.
I agreed. We can’t afford any heart attacks or stress-induced issues coming out of the simulations. And all that other stuff you suggested? Yeah, they went for it.” Claudine paused.
“All of it?” Joshua asked, shocked.
“Well, most of it. There were some tweaks, but the core was yours. So, congratulations. This should become law in the next month or so. I’ll pause there—are you still with me?”
Joshua took a deep breath, trying to process Claudine’s words. “I’m sorry, I’m just speechless.”
“Total win,” Claudine said firmly. “Bob told me your mini-simulation speech at the subcommittee meeting back in March greatly affected the Senators, and they managed to convince their party leadership to at least work with their colleagues to get something done here. Who knew you had a calling as a speechwriter?”
“Ha.” That was all Joshua could muster for a few seconds. “Well, whatever the reason, I’ll take it! So, is that it, then? Is this a done deal?”
“According to Bob, it is,” Claudine answered. “I wanted to be the first to call you and say what an honor it has been to work through this with you. When I first brought this to the Department of Health years ago, I never imagined in my wildest dreams that we would reach the point where it’s ready to become a law in the United States! It’s insane! I couldn’t have asked for a better partner and friend to work with. Your dedication—and Neil’s too—is why we’re here today. Thank you for trusting me and letting me guide you through this process as best I could”
Joshua felt tears welling in his eyes. It was amazing how quickly humans could go from smiling to tears rolling down their cheeks. All the emotions of the past few years since his trip to London seemed to come out simultaneously, and he couldn’t stop them.
“I’m sorry—I just can’t help but cry right now,” he managed amidst the crying and sniffling. Good thing Julie was inside; she would have started crying too, which would have made it worse for him. “Thank you for those kind words, and it has been my pleasure to go through this journey with you.”
He paused briefly and added, “I will tell Julie and the kids. Can I call you on Monday?”
“Of course, Joshua. Enjoy this with your family; you deserve it.”
That was the last thing he heard before the line went dead.
Joshua stood there for what seemed like an hour, gazing up at the sky and thinking about the past few years of his life and what the next chapter of his life would be like. The ups, the downs and the moments of doubt that this program would never come to fruition combined with the sleepless nights and the time away from his family.
All offset by the moments of joy when the team had a breakthrough that worked and the pure elation when they reviewed the survey results together after the initial testing was done.
He was truly part of an amazing team and all of the rollercoasters of emotion they all went through felt worth it at this moment.
Knowing that he was a key part of something that could change the world for the better made him feel a sense of peace and calm that he had never felt before. It was like whatever happened in his life from this point on was icing on the cake. A big, delicious piece of Lamington cake.
While Joshua was excited to see how the deployment of this program would go, he couldn’t help but wonder if everything would go exactly as him and his team thought it would.
As Joshua got to the house, he took a deep breath, composed himself and smiled as he walked inside to share the news with Julie.
CHAPTER 4
THE ROSE GARDEN CEREMONY
February 18, 2031
Dr. Claudine Shanley sat in her chair in the White House Rose Garden on a cool but sunny February afternoon, wrapped in a warm jacket, a wool hat snug over her head, and gloves covering her hands.
This was a day that was a long time coming, and Claudine felt proud and honored to be among the many powerful and influential figures gathered, waiting for the President’s speech. Today’s ceremony followed the official signing of the Anticipation Day bill, formally known as the Advancement of Society and Healthcare Spending Reduction Act (ASHSRA). The name was apropos, though she didn’t really care for it.
Claudine was confident this day would go down in history as a monumental change in the arc of human society. While it was hard to fathom that her work was the reason all of this started, at the end of the day, she was just doing her job. If she hadn’t discovered the initial unusual patterns, someone else would have. Yet, as the saying goes, “Things don’t turn up in this world until somebody turns them up.”
“I guess I’m the somebody,” she thought, staring into the empty space in front of her.
Glancing at her family sitting all around her, their faces beaming with excitement, Claudine’s heart warmed. However, her thoughts kept drifting back to early January 2026, when this journey began.
On January 12, 2026, Claudine sat in her Rockville, Maryland, office completing her normal Monday morning routine: reviewing datasets and summaries from state mental health agencies in order to prepare for weekly debriefs with her team.
Given the data was from right before the holidays, she had expected to see some data that looked unusual. The holidays were often stressful and depressing for many, either from overspending on presents or from spending the holidays alone.
Either way, the diagnosis of depression and anxiety disorders usually spiked in November and December. Claudine would typically contact the relevant states to get their view on the anomalies, scheduling calls for the following week. The issues were typically resolved quickly and the datasets returned to normal.
This time, however, something was off—several data sets were not making sense to her. To boot, the data that was off was in random parts of the country, which, from her experience, was rare.
As Director of the Behavioral Health Crisis Coordinating Office for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Ms. Shanley had seen it all during her 30+ years in the field. From the drug wars of the 1990s to the various mental health issues that confronted the United States after 9/11, she had witnessed almost everything imaginable before her promotion to Director in 2019.
Shortly after taking on this role, the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent societal shutdown, coupled with the rise in social media use among the youth, caused a rise in anxiety and depression rates across the country that had never been seen before.
Most recently, she had been dealing with the growing opioid and fentanyl addiction crisis and its related impact on mental health.
There was never a dull moment in her line of work.
Part of the reason for her promotion to Director was that she and her team were able to identify trends in reported mental health cases across the United States that warranted further investigation, research them to quickly identify the root cause, and develop systematic solutions to prevent further spread.
Most trends they investigated involved periodic spikes attributed to seasonal affective disorder, binge drinking, opioid use disorder, or bipolar disorder.
However, the datasets her team saw in January 2026 involving reports of increases in schizophreniform disorder appeared to be something that she had never encountered before.
In her experience, schizophreniform disorder was typically diagnosed when symptoms of schizophrenia—such as delusions, difficulty concentrating, and decreased participation in daily activities—presented themselves for a period of one to six months. After six months, the diagnosis generally shifted to schizophrenia.
So, when she read the monthly summary from several states noting a tenfold increase in schizophreniform disorder cases compared to the same month the previous year, she paid close attention.
Claudine took further notice when she saw that the average diagnosis period for the reported cases was around three weeks, which contradicted the typical length of time for this diagnosis. The patients were snapping out of exhibiting schizophrenia symptoms and presenting normal behaviors to both doctors and their families within weeks, not months, baffling the entire team.
Historically, when there is both a change in trend data and a fact that goes against current understanding, it indicates something new that requires further investigation. As she followed up on the impacted counties to obtain information about the demographic characteristics of those impacted, blood results, and other tests performed at medical facilities, her antennae raised even more.
From her initial reachout, it was determined that the new cases of this short-term schizophrenia were primarily affecting men and women, mostly over 40, from various wealthy clusters across the United States: New York City, Boston, Austin, Texas, and Silicon Valley, amongst others.
Historically, when she observed wealthy people impacted by mental health issues, it involved some sort of illegal drug: cocaine, acid, LSD, fentanyl, or whatever new drug of the month was causing rich people to lose their minds. However, drug tests for these initial cases did not support this theory, as most patients tested negative for any known substances.
She and her team were initially stumped. Although much about schizophrenia was still unknown, some general trends were widely agreed upon:
Females had a higher prevalence of mental illness than males.
18–25-year-olds had the highest prevalence of mental illness, with the prevalence decreasing with age.
Mixed-race individuals had the highest prevalence of mental illness, followed by American Indians and Caucasians. Individuals identifying as Asian had the lowest prevalence of mental illness.
Higher-income individuals had lower rates of schizophrenia than poor individuals.
Essentially, while older, rich individuals had some risk of developing schizophrenia, they were not generally considered high-risk. So, everything her team was seeing went against the known patterns of the disorder at the time.
Initially, there were theories thrown out suggesting some sort of early-onset dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. However, the percentage of patients with a family history of these conditions was in line with averages for the United States. Additionally, CT or MRI scans showed no brain lesions or brain damage, though a few people did have small tumors that were discovered incidentally.
Other theories involved previously unknown drugs or viruses that were undetectable when the patients presented themselves for testing, but the virologists Claudine contacted dismissed this theory.
So, again, Dr. Shanley and her team were stumped. Personally, she was frustrated, as she prided herself on quickly picking up on a trend and identifying potential causes.
By February 2026, similar schizophrenia episodes were reported in 15 states, with over 2,500 individuals affected. She then received clearance to conduct a full investigation to determine what was driving this increase. The summary findings she reviewed were perplexing.
The night she read the summary in early March 2026, sitting in her bed with a glass of Cabernet by her side, she was overwhelmed by the magnitude of its implications.
That report, now engrained deep in her memory, was presented to the late President Logan later that month.
Though the investigative process eventually uncovered the root cause, she couldn’t shake the thought that if her team had identified it sooner, they could have helped more people. By the time corrective actions could be taken, over 500,000 people had been diagnosed with schizophrenic disorder.
She hoped the long-term impacts of these cases would be minimal, though it was hard to say. Despite doing everything “by the book” and informing department leadership as quickly as possible, she still felt it wasn’t fast enough.
Regardless of how she felt, her journey to the Rose Garden ceremony was long and personal. A journey that eventually led to President Randolph signing the legislation this afternoon.
A police siren brought Claudine back into the present. She turned to her boyfriend, Charles, who was sitting beside her, and smiled. Behind her, her two daughters, Eva and Monica, chatted with their husbands and children about where they wanted to go eat after the ceremony.
Claudine was so happy to have her family with her today. They were the reason she did everything and they fully supported her journey to get here today, even with all of the scrutiny on her and her team’s work over the past several months.
As she turned back and looked at Charles, she smiled and once again got lost in her thoughts.
Claudine had lost her husband to cancer three years ago, in the middle of this entire process. After a long period of mourning, she finally got up the courage, with her daughter’s insistence, to join a popular dating app called Higher Connections, where all of the people on the app were cannabis users. One of the dates through this app resulted in her meeting Charles, a widower who had lost his wife to a car accident 18 months ago.
They bonded over their shared grief, and eventually, their friendship became romantic. Six months later, they were still together, and she was happy he was here. She needed a rock today, and he was it.
Her work to finalize the Anticipation Day bill led to much public attention for Claudine, which, given her introverted nature, was difficult for her. Claudine’s family supported her as best they could, but there was only so much they could do. The committee presentations available to the public plastered her face on every news channel and media outlet across the country. Calls flooded in: TV show bookings, media spots, speaking engagements, and even a book deal. Forced to hire a publicist and not see her family for weeks, she worked tirelessly with House of Representatives and Senate members to finalize key parts of the legislation.
While not as popular as Michael Jackson in the 1980s, Michael Jordan in the 1990s, or Taylor Swift a decade earlier, she was still a face people recognized in public.
It was one of the reasons she had asked Dr. Joshua Lee to deliver one of the final presentations to the Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence a year ago. She needed a break from the limelight, and he was up to the task. She appreciated Joshua for stepping up to give that speech.
Some days, she still wondered how this could happen to a girl from Asheville, North Carolina.
Meeting the late President Logan back in 2026 was one of the most nerve-racking, yet coolest, experiences of her life. It was rare for a federal agency director to interact directly with a President, at least in one-on-one meetings.
Though most of that day was a blur, the 60-minute conversation with President Logan was fully engrained in her memory. He was genuinely interested in getting her thoughts on the situation, strategies to confront the root cause, and the level of support she needed to develop an alternative solution. Despite his reputation as a selfish and narcissistic guy who didn’t care about the average American, her interactions with him suggested otherwise.
President Logan had always supported the foundation of this bill, even if it was tough to discern his true motives. While she believed he supported the program to benefit the average American, a small part of her suspected that he wanted to take credit for the program himself.
Nevertheless, his administration consistently provided support and funding, so he deserved all the credit for getting the bill to this point today.
Unfortunately, President Logan was assassinated in February 2027 and was quickly replaced by Vice President Randolph, a new-generation Republican leader who had been elected to the office of Vice President just a month earlier after former Vice President Ruff’s forced resignation due to a bribery scandal that ended his political career.
Before his vice presidency, President Randolph had served as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, and was known for his tireless work to help shift the country to nuclear and other renewables as part of President Logan’s push for a zero-net-carbon society by 2045.
Even though President Randolph was a Republican, he was able to win favor with some Democrats due to his scientific background and general respect for science to guide proper policy.
In a short span, President Randolph had gone from head of the EPA to the most powerful man in the world. His first huge task was taking over President Logan’s work on the Anticipation Day Bill.
The assassination, unexpectedly, seemed to finally bring the country together. Extremists on both sides turned down the heat enough to cool temperatures, allowing politicians to work together again. Talking heads on both sides of the aisles stressed unity and compromise rather than division. It was a strange yet productive time in Washington, D.C.

CHAPTER 1
THE SLEEPLESS NIGHT
March 14, 2030
Dr. Joshua Lee rolled onto his back and stared at the ceiling. It was impossible to go back to sleep. He sighed and asked his virtual assistant, Sylvia, what time it was. Her response didn’t help: “Good morning, Joshua. It is 4:33 a.m. local time, 6:33 p.m. Sydney time. Would you like me to summarize your upcoming day?”
“God no,” Joshua mumbled.
“Alright, Joshua. Please let me know if you need anything,” Sylvia replied.
At least he had gotten four hours of sleep. Drinking coffee past 8 p.m. was never a good idea, and having a cup at 9:30 p.m. to help calm his nerves was, in hindsight, an awful decision. With the biggest day of his life staring him in the face, Joshua should have popped some edibles, put on a movie, and gone to bed at a reasonable hour. Oh well, there was nothing he could do about it now.
He pulled off the blanket slowly and stumbled to the bathroom to relieve his bladder. Maybe that would help him relax.
After what felt like a record-breaking piss, he returned to the bedroom and opened the drapes of his suite on the top floor of the St. Regis hotel, staring at the bright lights of Washington, D.C.
He couldn’t help but wonder what this day, three and a half long years in the making, would bring for him. Joshua had poured his heart and soul into this project, missing first steps, first words and one anniversary with his wife Julie, all for the goal of getting legislation onto President Randolph’s desk for signature.
If that happened, and it was still a big if, Julie and Joshua could confidently say it had all been worth it.
As a result of this goal, he had been in Washington, D.C. for the past three painstaking weeks, which were filled with meetings, late-night sessions, and sleepless nights, all to prepare for his speech today to the Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence, a subset of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law.
His colleague, Neil Jergenson, was more than happy to let Joshua handle the speech and was hopefully sleeping in his suite on the second floor. Given his fear of heights, Neil had suggested Joshua take the suite on the higher floor, which was ironic given how high Neil was all the time.
At the relatively young age of 35, even Joshua found himself physically and mentally exhausted by the end of this three-week stretch. As such, everyone on his team agreed that he should take it easy the day before the speech. So, he had done just that by working out in the morning, eating a lean, healthy breakfast, and reading some books he had packed before his trip from Sydney. After a nap, he ordered a late lunch from room service, watched TV, and practiced his speech.
Julie, their seven-year-old son Owen, and two-year-old daughter Olivia had returned to Sydney weeks ago. The kids needed to get back to school, and Joshua and Julie didn’t want the kids around the media chaos that could follow his speech.
Joshua already missed his family dearly. And his home city of Sydney. He hadn’t spent much time there since they moved to the United States a few years earlier to allow him to perform his research. He eagerly looked forward to returning home after this exhausting process was over.
Julie had been an absolute angel, supporting him through each failure, redesign, subsequent failure, subsequent redesign, and eventual breakthrough. She was the rock of their family, never complaining about the long nights and weekends required of him and always understanding why it was necessary.
He was grateful she was by his side when he received the call that Neil and he were to present their findings to the panel after the huge success of human trials performed earlier in the year.
As he gazed out at the lit-up buildings of downtown Washington, D.C., tears welled in his eyes. He sighed, turned away from the window, and searched for the remote control to turn on the television so he didn’t feel so alone. The local station popped on, with the “really early morning” crew reporting protests in London, which had broken out as a rebuttal to the Church of England’s statement that Artificial Intelligence was against the teachings of the Bible and society should eliminate it in lieu of reverence for God.
“Ah, London,” he thought, sighing deeper than before.
Though he had been to London only a few times, the city held a special place in his heart. Even as a young boy, reading Sherlock Holmes, he had wondered what it would be like to walk the dark and misty streets of London at night.
As a teenager, watching old movies and shows about the Royal Family’s history and majesty made him wonder what it would be like to be a royal, surrounded by people who were privileged and wealthy, yet so stuck in their ways. While traveling the world and being adored by millions of people sounded wonderful, the lack of privacy would surely get old after a while.
However, it was his visit to London in June 2026 that he would never forget, as it changed his life forever.
Lying back in bed, he switched off the television, hoping to get a couple more hours of sleep. “Don’t get yourself worked up, J-Dog,” he muttered out loud, using the nickname he had created when he was very young as a way of fitting in with the cool kids from school. “Stop thinking about London and focus on your breathing. In… out… in… out…”
Yet, breathing didn’t help. His mind kept returning to London, to the raw excitement and hope from that phone call in 2026 that brought him to this very bed in Washington, D.C.
Prior to 2026, Joshua and Julie had been planning a trip to London for many years, starting when they first met in college at the University of Adelaide in 2015. Back then, Joshua was a shy and soft-spoken 20-year-old junior studying computer science on the advanced track, hoped to be part of the generation that took computing technology to the next level.
Growing up as an only child in the middle-class community of Smithfield, in the suburbs of Sydney, he never imagined getting a full scholarship to the university, let alone being accepted into the Australian Institute for Machine Learning program to continue his research into the most advanced computing technologies of the time.
His studies and research took up most of his spare time through the winter holidays of his junior year, when he decided to stay on campus and finalize some of the programs he was working on.
One day in late December 2015, Joshua stopped by his local hangout, the Adelaide Coffee Bar, a few blocks from his apartment. It was there that he first laid eyes on Julie behind the counter.
It was the first time he had seen her there and she was stunning: long blonde hair, crystal blue eyes, and the warmest smile he had ever seen.
When he ordered his coffee and croissant, she greeted him with a friendly, “How are you doing today?” His brain urged him to respond, but his mouth would not follow suit. After several seconds, he managed to say, “I’m good.”
As if that bland response wasn’t embarrassing enough, he spilled his freshly received coffee across the countertop and onto her apron. He wanted to crawl under the counter and die. It was one of the worst moments of his life.
Fighting the temptation to run out of the coffee shop and back to his apartment, never to set eyes on her again, Joshua, returned to his table with a new coffee and croissant, and escaped into his work.
Thirty minutes later Julie approached him, and asked how he was doing. This time, he replied, “Well, I haven’t made a complete ass out of myself in a half hour, so I’d say pretty good.” She shook her head and laughed, which led to a huge sigh of relief from Joshua. He proceeded to learn about her studies in Marine and Wildlife Conversation, her part-time job at the coffee shop to save up for a chance to travel the world visiting the most exotic tropical locations, her love of the ocean, music, dogs, and, of course, London.
It was like the heavens had opened up and dropped down the most perfect woman a mere few hundred meters from where he lived.
This conversation eventually led to a first date, subsequent dates, a relationship, a marriage, a family, and a life together that Joshua could never have imagined when he first walked into that coffee shop years earlier.
After college, Joshua landed an entry-level software development role at a fintech upstart in Sydney, making decent money. At the same time, Julie had just landed her dream job working for the Australian Institute of Science, studying the impact of climate change on the coral reefs around Australia.
They got married in late 2019 and planned a honeymoon in London for the summer of 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic ended any hopes of traveling. Once travel resumed in 2022, they planned another trip to London, only to have it derailed by Julie’s pregnancy with Owen.
Finally, in the summer of 2026, when Owen was three, they decided to take the 30-hour trip from Sydney to Heathrow to visit London together, as a family.
It was an exhausting and stressful trip, with stops at most of the major touristy spots. However, it was the phone call Joshua received while sitting in one of the oldest pubs in London, The Seven Stars in Aldwych, that made it an unforgettable trip.
Before they left Sydney, Joshua had told Julie he wanted to grab a proper “pint” in London, preferably at one of its oldest establishments. While he wasn’t a huge beer enthusiast, this felt like something he should do. Back then, the relatively few times a year he went all-in on his alcohol consumption, it was usually a nice Australian Shiraz or Pinot Noir. Occasionally, he would dabble in bourbon or scotch, mostly when Julie’s parents visited, as her dad had developed a taste for the finer things in life, which included a good bourbon.
On their last day in London, Owen was cranky and tired, so Julie told Joshua to find a pub to have the (hopefully) perfect beer by himself for a few hours.
After some quick research, he saw a pub about a click away called The Seven Stars in Aldwych. According to the website, the pub was built in 1602 and seemed to have all the traditional English pub features: oak floors, wooden beams across the ceiling, and a narrow, steep stairway from the bar area to the second floor. Shakespeare was said to have frequented the bar while working at the Blackfriars Theater, half a mile away.
Funny enough, the owner was Australian and had settled there in the 1970s. It felt like the right place for his perfect beer.
Joshua was feeling down that day as he crossed London Bridge over the River Thames on his way to the pub. The rainy, chilly weather didn’t help his mood but he was just in a general malaise.
Sure, he was happy with Julie and adored little Owen, but his career wasn’t where he’d hoped it would be. In college, he and his friends had talked about how one of them would change the world by creating the next multi-billion-dollar tech conglomerate. Joshua always believed that he would be the one to do it.
While that hadn’t happened yet, Joshua was still regarded as one of Australia’s top code developers. He was working on exciting projects in the fintech space that he hoped would receive some investment soon.
On top of his career concerns, he and Julie had also been arguing more recently. He loved her commitment to her research and respected her greatly, but a lot of the day-to-day care for Owen fell on his shoulders since she had to be out of town for her research.
Joshua loved how his relationship with Owen had blossomed, and he loved spending time with his son, but the mental and physical exhaustion was starting to get to him. Owen missed his mom, and with nightmares recently creeping into his nighttime routine, Joshua was not sleeping well and he found himself taking it out on Julie, making her feel guilty for being away so much.
Joshua disliked the person he was becoming and wished his life had more meaning. That’s why this trip to London seemed perfectly timed—Julie and he both needed family time together, and he had always wanted to explore London and learn more about its history and lore.
So, while his career wasn’t where he ideally wanted it to be, he was enjoying this trip and looking forward to what life had to bring in the coming years. If he only knew how drastically his life was about to change.
When Joshua finally reached the Royal Courts of Justice complex and walked onto tree-lined Carey Street, he was craving a drink. He spotted the small black sign of the Seven Stars bar ahead and headed inside.
It was smaller than he had imagined but cozy, with many old posters and photos on the purple walls. Clearly, the owner was fond of cats, evident from the dominating cat-themed decorations.
The bar area was small, but given it was the middle of the afternoon, it was fairly empty, so he went right up to the bar to place his order. While the beer selection was above average, he went with a traditional Guinness and a beef and potato pie. As he ordered, he felt bad for the hotel room toilet later in the day.
There were stairs to the left of the bar that went up to the second floor, which he decided to quickly check out after clearing it with the bartender.
Upstairs, he found more cat photos, old movie posters, and a small kitchen where something was sizzling in the fryer. It was unlike any bar he had ever been in—the kind he would have likely hung out in if he were a local: quaint, simple, and homely.
Returning downstairs, he sat at a small table by the window with his beer. Looking outside, he thought about the people who frequented this pub throughout the centuries. If only the walls could speak, they would surely have amazing tales to tell.
After a short wait, he received his meal and quickly downed it as he was famished. He ordered another couple of Guinness and checked on Julie and Owen, knowing Owen usually woke up from his nap by late-afternoon.
As he settled his bill, his cellphone lit up with a private number. Normally, he would let such calls go to right to voicemail, but something in him told him to answer. So, he did.
Five minutes later, after a conversation with a gentleman from the United States Division of Health, he knew he needed to get back to the hotel right away to speak to Julie. He had just been scheduled to fly to Washington, D.C., in a week to meet with leaders of something called the Anticipation Day Task Force, which was apparently creating some sort of new simulation experience for citizens of the United States.
Joshua had been selected to join the Task Force by someone within the United States government, although the caller did not say how or why Joshua was chosen. Many questions flooded his mind:
Why him? What would this mean for him and his family’s lives? Would they now have to consider moving to the United States? What the fuck was an Anticipation Day Task Force? What would people be anticipating?
He hurried through London’s crowded streets, feeling a strong buzz from the combination of the beer and the recent phone call. Passing St. Paul’s Cathedral, he stopped on London Bridge to take a few deep breaths and revel in his feelings. The universe seemed to have sensed what was missing from his life and instantly delivered the one absent ingredient: meaning.
It felt like his childhood dream had come true, and he was now in a James Bond movie.
He returned to the hotel and told Julie they needed to talk. It was a brief conversation, as Owen was begging for Joshua’s attention, but Joshua was able to summarize the phone call for her.
While Julie needed time to process the news, as always, she promised to support him, even if it meant finding more help for Owen or working closer to home.
They had no idea what “supporting him” would ultimately entail.
The sound of police sirens outside Joshua’s Washington, D.C., hotel room window interrupted his thoughts. He checked the time with Sylvia: 5:15 a.m. Realizing he needed a couple more hours of sleep, he knew only one thing could relax him enough to put him out.
The one good thing about Julie and the kids leaving was having a huge hotel suite all to himself.
He grabbed his tablet, scrolled to his favorite adult entertainment website, and eight minutes later, he was out like a light.
The extra 80 minutes of sleep boosted him enough to jump out of bed and into the shower when his alarm went off at 6:45 a.m.
The water pressure was so satisfying that he lingered under the hot stream for a bit, rehearsing the opening lines of his speech. He wanted to ensure he got the speech off to a strong start. While Joshua considered himself a decent public speaker and would have the speech there in front of him, addressing a Senate committee was on a different level. Not many people could prepare for the attention such a meeting would generate.
With the Senators, the media expected in the room, and the audience of hundreds that would be behind him, he half-considered wearing a diaper in case he shit himself. His only goal was to meet the Senators’ eyes and project confidence, allowing them to see the intensity in his eyes and hear the passion in his voice, so they knew he truly believed in this technology. Getting the speech off on the right foot was important, so he practiced it until it became ingrained in his memory.
As he finished showering and got dressed, he couldn’t help but think of how grateful he was to his family for their support on the long road it took to get to where he was today.
Once Joshua and Julie realized they would have to move to the United States, Julie’s mom decided to accompany them to help with Owen and household chores. The US government also funded a part-time nanny, providing plenty of support for Owen and allowing Julie to secure a research position at the University of Delaware, to advance her own research.
They settled in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, a quiet and beautiful community situated between Washington, D.C., and Boston. This location allowed Joshua to fly out of Dover Air Force Base, about an hour away.
Joshua needed to split his time between meetings in Washington, D.C., and several leading artificial intelligence research institutions, including MIT, Harvard, Columbia University, Stanford, and the University of California, Berkeley. There, he worked with top researchers and the most advanced technology to expedite the program safely and swiftly.
Consequently, he spent only one week per month at home, which he requested as part of the government deal in order to spend time with his family.
Besides the family support, Joshua appreciated how lucky he was to have been chosen for this position in the first place. As it turned out, Danny Gonzales, a colleague of Dr. Claudine Shanley, the head of the Task Force, was visiting his sister at the University of Adelaide in the spring of 2026 and had happened to sit in on a panel on artificial intelligence that Joshua had led. The panel’s topic was how artificial intelligence could lead to the development of simulated worlds, and Joshua had discussed the technological and ethical dilemmas of developing alternate realities.
While it was a great panel, the reality was anyone else with a similar background could have been chosen to be a part of this amazing and life-changing process.
Joshua’s 7:30 a.m. alarm to meet Neil downstairs jolted him back to his current reality. He checked his appearance in the mirror to make sure his salt-and-pepper hair looked as good as possible, his tie was as straight as could be and no remnants of last night’s chicken dinner were stuck in his teeth.
He went downstairs to the hotel lobby, ordered a kale, apple, and carrot concoction to calm his nerves, and popped two prescription scopolamine to control his nausea.
Seated with his drink, waiting, as usual, for his colleague and research partner, Neil Jergenson, to meet him in the lobby for the ride over to the US Capital, he took some more time to reflect, this time on the insane journey the two of them had been on since their first meeting in the fall of 2026.
If they knew the trials, tribulations, failures, and significant graying of their hair it would take to get to this point, Joshua was certain they would still do it all over again.
Joshua knew Neil was the right man for the job the moment he met him at the Black Sheep bar in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in September 2026. At first, he wondered whether Neil was old enough to drink legally; he had no facial hair, wore glasses, and had a voice that reminded Joshua of Screech from Saved by the Bell (Joshua loved cheesy 1990s sitcoms).
Alas, Neil was old enough to order a beer and turned out to be one of the most intelligent people Joshua had ever encountered, even at the tender age of 25.
Neil was an up-and-coming computer scientist who had recently graduated from the Schwarzman College of Computing at MIT. He was in his second year of research at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), focusing on visual computing.
They spent hours at the bar discussing the government’s request. Neil was intrigued by the technological aspect, bringing up concepts like mind interfaces and implants, duplicating neural connections in the brain, downloading consciousness onto silicon-based devices to arrive at a theoretical Simulation Point, and running ancestral simulations.
Neil mentioned that CSAIL was already working on a smaller-scale project whereby humans could experience a full-scale simulation experience of a specific era within a pod. However, the simulation was limited to a made-up world, with an inability to fully engage all five senses. He was also aware of some private companies that had developed in-home gadgets to create a simulated world, but he hadn’t personally tried them as they were costly.
With recent advances in quantum and neuromorphic computing, time dilation technology, reinforcement learning, and generative adversarial networks, they agreed that this could be accomplished relatively quickly with proper financial and regulatory support.
So, Neil came on board with an enthusiasm that was tough to match. Eventually, the Task Force funded hundreds of millions of dollars for securing computer and server equipment, hiring personnel to develop, secure, and test the technology, renting out facilities to administer the experiences, and analyzing the program’s impact on the economy and society as a whole.
Over the next six months, Neil and Joshua worked closely with their academic research teams to develop a safe and efficient method for delivering this experience to the public.
While they were involved on the technical side of things, Joshua led all meetings with the Task Force and over 150 government agencies that were involved with the process—an amount he felt was about 50% too many. Unfortunately, this involved many painful and contentious meetings with government officials, lunch and dinner meetings with countless lobbyist groups, late-night meetings with government contractors located in Europe, and 6 a.m. meetings with government contractors in India, Vietnam, and other Asian countries.
The Task Force meetings were much more pleasant, with all the leaders focused on delivering this project as quickly and safely as possible. Joshua led the technological development, which was the most important one, given that if the technology didn’t work safely and effectively, the rest of the mission would be rendered useless.
Other leaders on the force were tasked with sourcing data for the simulations, setting regulations around physical and mental health monitoring, sourcing and developing necessary hardware, recruiting test subjects, and overseeing many other changes within the Labor Department, Treasury Department, and the Justice Department, amongst others.
For Joshua and Neil, it was a lot of pressure to deliver something that not only worked, but worked so well that it would leave every participant wanting more. A lot more.
So, they were practically tied to the hip, except during Joshua’s meetings with government officials, dinners, or Sundays—their day off. For Joshua, Sundays were dedicated to his family so they could enjoy peaceful walks on the beach, watch movies, or simply spend time together at home. These days were essential for him to help recharge the batteries.
Their hard work paid off in April 2027 when the approval for testing research animals was received, primarily to ensure the chip implants didn’t impact brain activity or functions, and confirming there were no immediate issues requiring correction before the use of human subjects.
By late August 2027, as they entered a wait-and-see mode, Joshua and Julie took the family back to Australia to wait for the testing to move the process along. This was a refreshing break to spend time with their families, as they hadn’t seen each other in nearly a year.
Unexpectedly, this trip turned out to be quite productive as, in September 2027, Julie discovered she was pregnant again, which certainly threw a wrench into their plans. When they found out it was a girl, Julie expressed happiness since she had always wanted a little girl, leading them both to view it as a blessing.
Julie gave birth to Olivia in June 2028, just as the technology received final approvals for human testing following successful animal trials.
After much discussion, Joshua and Julie decided that he should return to the United States alone. Being away from their extended families with the two little ones would be too difficult, especially since Joshua was going to be traveling so much for work that he wouldn’t be home much anyway. It was a tough decision for him, but ultimately the right one.
His first official speech was delivered in August 2028 to the Committee on the Use of Humans as Experimental Subjects (COUHES) at MIT. He summarized the technology, its anticipated use, pre-and post-study monitoring of the human subjects, and the duration of the testing.
He received many questions regarding the potential physical and psychological impacts of this technology on subjects, as well as its ethical implications for society.
Luckily, his team had prepared for these questions and focused the committee on several important points:
The human subjects could select the time and location of their simulation, provided sufficient historical information existed for accurate recreation. This allowed subjects to mentally prepare for the world they were being transported to and what physical and emotional challenges they would expect. One of the key theories of this program was that the subjects’ experience with their simulation would positively impact the subjects’ emotional and mental well-being, even if the simulation itself was a stressful or negative experience.
Subjects had the option to change their simulation every year, so they would have the ability to learn and experience various simulations throughout their natural lifetime.
The human subjects would be constantly monitored, and they could terminate the simulation at any time, particularly if they felt emotionally unstable or uncomfortable, or if real-word events required their immediate withdrawal from the simulation.
The chip implant technology used as a link from the computers simulating the subjects’ neuropathways used materials with minimal long-term health risks, validated through prior testing on animal subjects. Similarly, the ring device being utilized during the simulation posed no significant long-term risks to the patient.
The subjects would be monitored post-experience, both physically and mentally, to ensure any negative impacts are fully documented and addressed with appropriate medical attention.
Fortunately, the committee agreed, and human research proceeded in the fall of 2028. Forty machines were set up across MIT to conduct over 5,000 simulations, which were expected to take three to four months to complete.
For these tests, each subject would have two simulations run. The first would have the participant choose a historical period from three options provided. In the second simulation, they would choose a specific day from their lives to relive, requiring a separate download of their memories onto a secure drive stored on double-encrypted servers in a government-secured facility.
By January 2029, after completing their final test run and reviewing the favorable survey results, they knew they had accomplished nothing short of staggering.
While Joshua and Neil knew the next step was to convince governmental regulators that this would benefit society, they believed the data was unmistakable and irrefutable.
Over the following year, they monitored the subjects for any long-term negative side effects; with fewer than 1% reporting any such effects.
During this period, the Task Force nominated Neil and Joshua to present the results of this test to the newly formed Senate Committee on Artificial Intelligence, which comprised several influential senators. Approval by this committee almost guaranteed bill passage in the Senate. With Republicans leading the House of Representatives and a centrist Republican in the White House, there was not much to stop the bill from becoming law if this committee approved it.
In February 2030, Joshua and Neil were ready to present to the committee, which brought them to Washington for this morning’s presentation.
As Joshua took a final drink of his juice, he heard Neil’s voice behind him say, “Good morning, fine sir. Are you ready for this?”
Joshua snapped out of his third trip down memory lane this morning, stood up, and shook Neil’s hand. “As ready as I’ll ever be. I slept like shit, but I don’t think I was expecting anything else.”
Neil quickly replied, “You and me both, but for different reasons. I had to kick that waitress from that Italian restaurant down the street out of my hotel room around midnight, but man, what a ride, if you know what I mean.” He winked at Joshua.
Neil had gotten divorced a few months ago and seemed to be enjoying the single life.
“I don’t know what you mean, but yeah, she was cute. Glad you enjoyed your night,” Joshua said with a smile.
“Well, Bob at Rosenfarb and Craven called. He tried reaching you, but you must have been in the shower or jerking off or something. He wanted you to know that if today’s hearing goes well, Claudine and other Task Force members believe we’ll have enough support in the Senate to push this through quickly. Boom baby!
There’s likely still going to be pushback from religious conservatives, but even some of them can be convinced, given they can go back in time to see Jesus or Abraham or whatever. He also wanted to relay the message, and I quote: ‘Do not fuck this up!’”
Joshua chuckled and looked up before closing his eyes and taking a deep breath. As if he didn’t have enough pressure to get this speech right, now he knew that this really had a chance of continuing to move forward. He felt both excitement and nausea; not only would there be a lot of eyes on his performance today in the room, but half the country was expected to watch this session live. Soon, he would be the face of Anticipation Day, whether he liked it or not.
Neil broke his train of thought, pointing out that their team was waiting outside with the van that would take them to the Capitol.
“Let’s go get ‘em, tiger!” Joshua heard Neil say before they exited the lobby into the cool, sunny day, climbed into the car, and headed toward the Capitol building.
CHAPTER 2
THE TESTIMONY
March 14, 2030
- Capital Building 8:15 a.m.
Neil, Joshua, and their assistants, Magda and Omar, arrived at the Russell Senate Building 45 minutes before the 9 a.m. scheduled start time. As Joshua got out of the car and looked around, he remembered the riots of 2028 that had destroyed some sections of the Capitol area, including parts of the Russell building, requiring renovations and additional security measures both inside and outside the building.
As such, it took them about 15 minutes to fully get through security and enter the Russell Rotunda, where Joshua saw multiple white archways and columns extending from floor to ceiling, the coffered dome looming above, and doorways leading in multiple directions.
For anyone seeing it for the first time, the entryway was imposing.
The team walked upstairs to the Caucus Room, which featured a richly detailed ceiling highlighted with gold leaves, twelve giant Corinthian columns, and a multitude of pilasters that had to be over two stories high. There were mahogany benches scattered throughout the room and one large chandelier in the center, which was surrounded by four smaller chandeliers, providing ample lighting.
The room appeared to be about half full, with a few people putting the final touches on the seating and refreshments. A small table was set up in front of an elevated platform that housed a larger table to seat the eleven senators who made up the Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence, along with seats for aids and assistants.
Between the elevated platform and the smaller table, the members of the press attending the hearing were mulling about.
On the floor, there had to be a couple of hundred seats arranged for other attendees, including family, friends, and colleagues of Joshua and Neil, as well as assistants and other guests invited by the subcommittee. Two microphones and a pitcher with glasses, likely filled with water but which Joshua secretly hoped would be tequila to calm his nerves, were on the table.
Neil commented that he was going for a bathroom break. Joshua thought he should too, but before he could turn around to head to the restroom, he heard a familiar voice: “Hey Josh!”
He wheeled around and saw his old classmate, Chris Harbinger, from the University of Adelaide, walking toward him.
“Chris! What on earth brings you here, mate?” Joshua exclaimed, hugging his old junior-year friend.
“Hey man, I wouldn’t miss this—you know that! I’m close to Marily Vazquez, and she invited me. She said you were awesome to work with. Looks like this process has grayed you a bit, huh?” Chris said, grinning.
Joshua smiled back. “Yeah, mate. It’s been a few long years working on this. How the hell are you?”
“Yeah, the wife and I decided to get out of Sydney a few years ago. She got an opportunity to work for American University, so I applied for contracting work with the Department of Defense. I’ve been there ever since, doing cybersecurity work. Gotta keep the bastards in the US government honest on some level. But I’m loving it here. We moved to northern Virginia last year so the kids could have a bigger backyard.” Chris paused, looking at Joshua. “Crikey, man, it’s been so long; it’s great to see you! I heard you were doing this presentation and had to find you to congratulate you on whatever world-changing invention you’ve created.”
Joshua felt his Australian slang returning after just these few minutes with Chris. “Goodonya, mate, I’m really happy for you. I had no idea you were here. We lived up in Delaware for a bit before Julie got pregnant with Olivia. She stayed back in Sydney while I finished this roadshow. I wish I’d known you were here, but honestly, I was so busy that it would have been tough to get together. Now that I know, let’s catch up after this meeting, okay? You were always a larrikin, but having you here with me means a lot. I gotta take a piss and get ready for this thing. Good seeing you. Find me after the hearing, won’t ya?”
“Reckon, mate, good luck with this speech… come here!” Chris pulled Joshua in for another tight hug. “Go piss and give ’em hell!”
“Thanks, Chris. Good seeing you.” Joshua turned and headed to the restrooms outside. Chris was a fun time back in college, and their brief conversation calmed Joshua down a bit.
After taking care of business and ensuring he looked presentable, Joshua returned to the room, which was now mostly full. He recognized some familiar faces—colleagues of Neil and other folks he had met at MIT, Harvard, and other colleges during their travails over the past couple of years.
He saw Danny Gonzales, whose recommendation to Claudine Shanley started this process years earlier. Joshua went over to say hello, shook his hand, and then sat at the table to review his speech for what felt like the 4,721st time. Unfortunately, Claudine wasn’t at the meeting as she was recovering from back surgery a few weeks earlier. However, they had spoken the day before, and she had wished him good luck and told him how proud she was.
He spent the next ten minutes scanning the speech to ensure he could recite most of the beginning by heart.
Finally, around 9:00 a.m., an announcement was made: “The meeting of the Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence will commence in ten minutes.”
Joshua stood, stretched, and saw Neil, Omar and Magda walking towards him, all engaging in small talk with one of his old colleagues. Eventually, Omar and Magda took their seats behind Joshua while Neil sat next to him at the table, giving him a slight nod that said: You got this.
At exactly 9:10 a.m., the rear doors closed, and everyone was asked to take their seats. Doors on the side of the room opened, and the eleven senators and their aides began to enter.
The cameras flashed rapidly as the Senators walked in. Joshua recognized their faces immediately from preparation meetings with his team. There was:
Senator Marsha Johnson (R) from New York, Chairwoman
Senator Alberto Guiterrez (R) from Florida, Ranking Member
Senator Harlan Connelly (R) from South Carolina
Senator Chris Donogue (D) from Massachusetts
Senator Kyle Drummond (R) from Colorado
Senator Diane Fielding (R) from Wyoming
Senator Jane French (D) from New Jersey
Senator Jack Hughes (D) from Florida
Senator Robert Mulligan (R) from Arizona
Senator Michael Smith (D) from Minnesota
Senator Robin Tuttle (D) from Virginia
As they sat down in their seats, Senator Johnson took a sip of water, adjusted her microphone, shuffled some papers in front of her, and prepared to give her welcoming remarks.
“Good morning. The hearing will come to order.
I want to thank everyone for being here, especially those of you who traveled a great distance to attend this 22nd meeting of the Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence. Thanks to the Ranking Member and his team for working with us to organize this hearing.
Artificial intelligence is one of the key issues of our time. Its development and implementation is causing, and will continue to cause, significant changes in healthcare, entertainment, the environment, the economy and the way we interact with each other. The very concept of artificial intelligence will challenge our definition of what it means to be ‘human.’
Over the past few years, technological advances have increased fivefold due to breakthroughs in computing power and chip technologies. These advances raise concerns about the impact of this technology on everything from privacy and surveillance bias and discrimination to our physical and mental well-being. The questions of regulation and compliance are something this committee has taken very seriously throughout its three and a half years of existence.
However, we have never faced a proposal like the one before us today. If this proposal becomes law, it will result in a full transformation of American society. Therefore, no one on this panel, whether Republican or Democrat, should take this responsibility lightly.
As Stan Lee once said, ‘With great power comes great responsibility.’ Our task is to ensure that if the government grants the power of a full-scale simulation to each eligible citizen, it is delivered safely, securely, and methodically, and monitored in a responsible and consistent way. This will ensure the long-term implications are properly understood and addressed.
As Shakespeare said, ‘We know what we are, but know not what we may be.’ All the members of this panel aim to ensure that what we may become in these simulations does not impact what we are as human beings in the real world.
Today, we are here to discuss the results of the technology developed over the past several years to support Bill S1042, sponsored by Senators Mary Childs and Tom Barrows. This bill, introduced last year, proposes to legalize an annual simulated experience for eligible citizens of the United States. The Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law assigned this bill to the current committee.
I welcome the insights of Doctors Joshua Lee and Neil Jergenson, who have led the development of this technology. They are here to present their findings to this panel. With that, I turn to the Ranking Member, Senator Guiterrez.”
Joshua’s eyes drifted to his right, where Senator Guiterrez was sitting.
“Thank you, Senator Johnson, and to the expert witnesses for being here with us today.
I cannot think of a more important issue for this panel to discuss than what appears to be a full-scale government-backed takeover of the human mind, for what you say will lead to a happier society. While that sounds idealistic in theory, my Republican colleagues and I have significant concerns about the security, practicality, and moral implications of this rollout.
How can we honestly guarantee positive outcomes for everyone entering these simulations? The mere suggestion to let human beings choose another world to live in for a predetermined period, experience the realness and intensity of that world, and even possibly die in that world leads me to believe this technology is not ready for real-world deployment. We lack a full understanding of this technology’s long-term implications for the average American’s psyche.
I want to ensure this does not fall into the same category as other failed social experiments like Winthrop Kellogg’s Ape, or the Stanford Prison Experiment. Far too many lives are on the line here.
While I appreciate the longing to lead a different life—trust me, I, too, would love to be an astronaut on Mars for a month—the reality is that my real life lies here on Earth. I owe it to the people of Florida and throughout the country, to fully vet and challenge this initiative before I vote to move it forward for consideration.
I hope this committee can maintain a balanced approach, ensuring this technology is secure, safe, and monitorable before making it available to the American public. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today. Thank you, Chairman, for scheduling this committee.”
Chairman Johnson cleared her throat and continued, “Thank you, Ranking Member Guiterrez. Let’s begin with our witness introductions.
Our first witness today is Joshua Lee, lead scientist and researcher for the Anticipation Day Task Force. He is a graduate of the University of Adelaide and a recognized affiliate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, and Brown University.
We’ll start with Mr. Lee’s statement. Please aim to stay within 30 minutes; we will not use the gavel for a slight overrun, but if you exceed five minutes, I will have to remind you of the limit. Thank you for your cooperation. Mr. Lee, over to you.” Chairman Johnson set down her microphone, and the room fell silent.
Joshua took a deep breath, quickly sipped some water, and resisted an urge to release a huge fart. After glancing at Neil beside him and checking his notes for the last time, he looked back up at the eleven senators. “Here goes nothing,” he thought.
“Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Gutierrez, distinguished Committee members, and staff members who made today possible, thank you for the opportunity to discuss the findings of our Task Force. We believe that these results hold far-reaching implications for our society going forward. I extend my gratitude to the Task Force for giving me the honor of being here today, especially Dr. Claudine Shanley, who has been both a mentor and friend.
My name is Joshua Lee, lead researcher on this project, which has been the passion of both my colleague and friend, Neil Jergenson, and myself for the past three and a half years.
I vividly recall the day in London in the summer of 2026 when I received a call from a man I had never spoken to before who told me that I had been handpicked to join a new task force which had been created to develop a transformative simulation experience for every eligible American citizen.
As soon as I hung up, I knew my life was about to change, but I could not have imagined how much.
With the support of my family, we moved to America to begin a three and a half year journey that has led us here today. From the beginning, the primary goal of my team and the rest of the Task Force was to ensure the technology we developed was applied safely and securely. Secondarily, we aimed to develop an experience so lifelike that it would transform the lives of whomever experienced it.
Neil and I tirelessly worked on developing, testing, and securing this technology to interface with our neurological and nervous systems to facilitate a seamless and safe transition between the real and simulated worlds.
We have conducted over 10,000 simulations, with results that speak for themselves, as I will discuss shortly.
But before I do this, I have a simple request for each member of the Committee: please indulge me for a moment.” Joshua paused for a second before continuing.
“Close your eyes and try to tune out any noise in this room. I promise I won’t pelt you with anything, but I can’t vouch for other folks here.” Laughter broke out in the room as Joshua grinned at the line he had incorporated the previous night.
After exchanging brief glances, the Committee members smiled and eventually closed their eyes, relaxing.
“Thank you for indulging me. Now with your eyes closed, take a few deep breaths, relax and calm yourself.”
He waited a moment. “I hope everyone is there. Now, I want you to picture a place. It could be a town, a city, a house, a beach, a lake, a national park you’ve been to, or any other place that lives in your mind’s eye. This place doesn’t necessarily need to hold special meaning for you, but it should bring you some level of peace and happiness. Have you found your place?
Now that you’ve found your place, pick a year. Any year—it doesn’t matter. It can be this year, or you can go back millions of years, even to the time of the dinosaurs. Okay? Have your year?”
The room was mostly silent.
“Good. Now, picture yourself in this time and place and think about what you see: Are there people? What are they wearing? Do people even exist yet? Is this a natural setting? What surrounds you? Trees, oceans, mountains, forests? Are there animals? If so, what are they doing? Take a moment to truly see and feel this place.”
Joshua glanced up at the Senators, who appeared deep in thought and, importantly, calm.
“Think about what you can hear. If people are nearby, are they talking? What are they talking about? Are there cars or other vehicles? Are there natural sounds, like the wind, rain, or animals? Take a moment to imagine the sounds in this place.
Now, think about what you can smell. Are there people who smell? What do they smell like? Are the smells pleasant? Foul? A mix of both? Are there smells from cars, trucks, or other man-made objects? If you’re outside, what do you smell from the natural world around you? Perhaps the salty air near the ocean or the sweet, fruity, or musky fragrance of flowers. Take your time to breathe in the various scents of your chosen place.”
Joshua paused for effect.
“Next, think about what you can touch. Are you indoors, where you can feel objects like tables or chairs? Are you in a city with cars or buildings that you can touch? Or are you outside in the wilderness, able to touch trees, water, or grass? Can you feel a person’s skin? Think about what and who you can touch in this place.
Finally, think about what you can taste. Think about the local cuisine, if there is one. Is it something you have eaten before? What is the texture of the food and the drinks? Imagine those flavors on your tongue. I sense some of you are hungry; I can hear your stomachs growling.”
A few chuckles arose from the crowd. Joshua quieted his voice.
“Keep your eyes closed for a moment and picture yourself exploring this place in your mind—whether for a day, a week, a month, or a year. What things would you find? What people would you meet? What sights would you see? What food would you eat? What thoughts and emotions would you have about being in this time and place? Hold those thoughts for a moment, please.”
There was complete silence in the room, interrupted by the occasional click of a camera shutter or the shuffle of shoes on the marble floors.
He counted to ten.
“Thank you. Please open your eyes.” The Senators opened their eyes looking relaxed.
“Think about what you are feeling right now. Happiness? Positivity? Peace? If I offered you the chance to visit this place once a year, or any other place of your choice, what would you feel? Hopeful? Less stressed?”
He took a moment before saying the next word.
“Anticipation?
Think about that word: anticipation. Are you anticipating being able to experience this time and place one day? To live whatever life you desire? To experience a whole new world free from the stress, drama, and repercussions of your current life? Forget, just for a moment, your political affiliation, race, sex, religion, or lack thereof, or the people you represent.
Each one of us knows the pleasure of anticipating something. Whether it is a favorite restaurant meal, knowing you and your partner are about to make love, or seeing a live performance of your favorite sports team or artist, that feeling of anticipation is one of the most powerful emotions we can have as humans. It makes us appreciate being alive and everything life has to offer.
Would it surprise you to learn that anticipation releases dopamine, resulting in a decrease in negative or painful feelings along with increased arousal and excitement?
What if you could harness that sense of anticipation for the entire year?” Joshua emphasized the word “entire.”
“Imagine anticipating a positive, uplifting event every day for the rest of your life. After experiencing this technology, we believe every human being will anticipate these experiences every year for the rest of their lives and will strongly incentivize them to meet the program’s eligibility requirements around physical and mental well-being, criminal activity, citizenship, and more. It is why this program was named Anticipation Day.
As I mentioned, our simulations will allow participants to revisit any historical period supported by recorded facts and figures. The technology will develop an entire world, which will be loaded onto dissolvable chips implanted safely and painlessly in human subjects. These chips store multiple petabytes of data sourced from over three trillion historical records—governmental, academic, and others. These data sources allow us to recreate how a Great Pyramids builder would have lived their life or what a Mt. Everest climber would go through second by second.
Any period in recorded or scientific history is available for every citizen to choose from. However, spiritual texts such as the Bible, Torah, and Quran require separate consideration and agreement on how certain historical religious events would be portrayed in the simulation. For example, there is no scientific proof of Jesus’ resurrection and walking on water, but it could be recreated in a simulation based on the descriptions in the Bible.
Theoretically, we can simulate any purported historical event, regardless of scientific backing. Who’s to say we can restrict people’s curiosity to see how Noah built his ark, even if there is no proof it happened as depicted in the Bible?
We understand these are sensitive areas requiring further consideration and we look forward to those conversations.”
Joshua turned a page of his report and took a quick sip of water. He should have worn a damn diaper.
“One exciting area of development in the field of neuroscience technology that Neil and I are most proud of is its ability to recreate a specific day from a person’s life.
These simulations will be based on a download of memories obtained from the human subject in order to recreate any chosen day that is supported by actual memories. Yes, we can do this.
Think about the ability to relive a day with a loved one who has passed away or revisit an amazing trip with your best friend after college. Senator Mulligan, you could even go back and experience that high school football championship game again,” he said, prompting a few chuckles around the room. Senator Mulligan smiled at him, nodding subtly.
“I’ve got ‘em,” Joshua thought.
“We feel this option will greatly benefit individuals who may want a more familiar and personalized experience.
Our technology is powered by a network of supercomputers with 1 million petaflops of computing speed. A petaflop can perform one quadrillion, which is ten to the 15th power floating point operations per second. This speed allows us to replicate the human brain’s activities and support approximately 1 million daily simulations.
Due to the amount of energy these servers will demand, more renewable energy sources must be prioritized to avoid overloading current systems. This bill will provide the largest investment in renewable energy in history, with nuclear, hydrogen, geothermal, fusion, wind, solar, and hydropower leading the charge. This bill will also continue our investment in carbon sequestration technology to offset any increase in carbon dioxide emissions due to the program’s rollout.
Our technology will benefit from top-tier cybersecurity programs, with the backing and experience of the most talented cybersecurity experts in the world.
In conclusion, we believe the development of this technology is a remarkable achievement that was unimaginable, even just five years ago. We are immensely grateful to the teams and partners who helped us get to this point. This will transform the life of the average American in ways they can’t imagine.
Now, I will proceed to discuss the results from last year’s trials. As detailed in the materials submitted to you, we selected 10,210 volunteers from a random pool of over 30,000 eligible volunteers aged 18 to 70, with no restrictions based on race, sexual identification or sexual orientation, religious background, or geography.
These volunteers primarily came from specific subsectors of the population, such as government employees, doctors, scientists, and key academic leaders. Additionally, a small percentage of individuals were from the general population, including social media influencers, leaders of Fortune 1000 organizations, and others we believed could effectively advocate for the implementation of this technology.
Each participant obtained clearance from their primary physician and a trained psychiatrist. Furthermore, all subjects signed waivers acknowledging any potential risks associated with the experience.
There were two parts to the trial.
For the first part, 5,105 subjects were presented with three simulation options:
Living in New York City in 1939, during the World’s Fair, as the owner of a pizzeria.
Living in Rome in 1875 as a day trader.
Living in Tibet as a monk in the present time.
Among these, 1,996 chose New York City in 1939, 2,126 chose Rome in 1875, and 983 opted for Tibet as a monk.
The subjects could also choose to be in the simulation for what would feel like one week, one month, or one year. 2,797 chose one week, 1,798 chose one month, and the remaining 510 selected one year. We expected some hesitancy among participants to choose longer times due to the newness of this experience.
To clarify, regardless of the chosen duration, the actual simulation lasted approximately seven hours in real life.
After completing the simulation, the subjects were asked to give detailed feedback on four specific questions about their experience:
Was the experience positive or negative?
Would they have this experience again?
Would they prefer a shorter or longer duration for future simulations?
Would they recommend this experience to others?
We also asked a series of questions regarding their physical, emotional, and mental well-being before and after the simulation to ensure it did not impact their capacities.
From the trial’s subjects, an astounding 99.6% said they would absolutely or likely want to do the simulation again, with over 92% rating the experience as positive. The 8% who found it negative all ended the simulation early. Most of them mentioned they didn’t enjoy the simulation they chose but would try a different scenario again. We believe this issue will be rectified by allowing participants to choose their own time and place upon implementation.
Another interesting finding was that over 93% of the subjects said they would choose a longer period, for example going from a week to a month, or one month to two months, etc. Among the 7% who said they would prefer a shorter time, most had chosen to experience a year and found it too long to feel like they were away from their real lives.
A remarkable 98% of participants recommended others go through this experience, while the remaining 2% were unsure. No one, I repeat, not a single individual suggested others not to experience this. We believe this validates our position that participants felt safe and enjoyed their overall experiences.
For the second part of the experiment, a separate group of 5,105 subjects was chosen to relive a day from their past. This required a download of their memories to find the chosen day.
The subjects were briefed on the simulation and the fact that the day would be relived based on how they remembered it, not necessarily how it actually happened. This simulation, of course, would feel like it lasted 24 hours. In the future, should this legislation be approved, we may look to increase the duration of the simulation, which would require the recall of additional memories.
Again, 96% of the subjects reported it as a positive experience with this part of the trial. This is understandable, given that the day they chose likely brought back warm and happy memories.
73% of the subjects chose a day to see a deceased loved one, while 15% picked a day to relive an accomplishment, such as winning a sports championship or spending a good day with their family. The remaining 12% selected a day to relive an experience with an ex-lover or friend they no longer spoke to.
97% of participants would recommend this experience to others, as even if the day they chose didn’t bring back positive emotions, the experience itself was positive.
As you can see, the vast majority of subjects in both experiments had a positive experience, would proceed with the simulation again, and would do so for a longer period.”
Joshua quickly looked at Neil, who gave him a thumbs-up.
“Now, on to the participants’ physical and mental health. We asked the subjects a series of questions, which you can find in our submitted research papers, about their mental health before and after the simulation.
What emotions did they feel? Did they feel depressed? Did the simulation experience cause any confusion after it was over?
One key component of the simulation is that the memories from the simulation stay with the participant, like a dream. Most participants could remember a good portion of the details of the simulation, but the longer the simulation went on, the fewer specifics they could recall from the entire simulation, similar to real life.
As Dr. Jergenson and I have each done two simulations ourselves, we can confidently say that the detail you see in the simulation is as real as anything you experience daily.
However, we recognize that even if participants report a good experience, they still require monitoring for any potential threat of depression or anger, which could lead to self-harm or harm to others. This would be counterintuitive to what we are trying to achieve. Therefore, we steadfastly support continuous physical and mental monitoring post-simulation to identify and rectify any significant negative side effects immediately.
From a physical well-being standpoint, we monitored significant vital signs during the simulation, such as body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. We also tracked brain activity during the simulation to ensure it remained within normal levels. The simulation mimics the third stage of the sleep cycle, the deepest stage, where heart rate and respiratory rates are at their lowest and muscles are fully relaxed. This allowed subjects to wake up feeling rested and refreshed, allowing them to recall their simulations as much as possible afterward.
Of the 10,210 subjects, only 98 developed negative physical conditions post-simulation. These included 30 heart-related issues, 22 cancer diagnoses, and the remaining cases of various other illnesses. All the cases were eventually determined to be unrelated to anything from the simulation. Currently, 21 of the cancer patients are either receiving treatment or are in remission. Unfortunately, one individual developed pancreatic cancer and passed away earlier this year, but this was not related to the simulation experience.
From a mental well-being standpoint, we required monthly check-ups for every participant to monitor their mental health post-simulation. When negative mental conditions arose —conditions that would normally require medical or psychological follow-up with a trained professional—we conducted full follow-ups with the subject’s primary physician or a certified psychiatrist to ensure the root cause was identified and treated.
Of the 10,210 subjects, 224, or 2.2%, had negative mental conditions post-simulation with 128 related to depression, 68 to anxiety, and 28 to other non-life-threatening mental conditions.
Among the 128 depression cases, we spent significant time with the subjects to determine whether they had a history of depression prior to entering the simulation. Medical records and subsequent interviews revealed that 84 of these subjects had a family history of depression, while the remaining 44 did not. Of these 44 without family history, 32 did not believe the simulation caused their depression, whereas 12 believed the simulation was a factor. That equates to 0.12% of the total subjects for the trial.
Of these 12 cases that believed the simulation was a factor in their depression, eight had symptoms alleviated within 12 weeks after the simulation, and the remaining four within 24 weeks.
Notably, 72% of the depression cases were related to the second experiment, where the participants relived a day in their lives, which we attributed to the fact that it evoked memories of someone from their past, such as a relative or friend that had passed or an ex-lover that got away, for example.
The remaining 28% who experienced depression from the first experiment attributed their symptoms to the overall sad environment they witnessed or other miscellaneous reasons.
The Task Force worked very closely with all cases of negative mental conditions to ascertain whether the simulation may have caused or led to the condition and to ensure ongoing monitoring of these subjects. We have not found any direct link between the simulation experience and any long-term mental issues. To repeat, we have not found any direct link between the simulation experience and any long-term mental issues.
This conclusion was verified by the International Psychotherapy Institute and the American Psychiatric Association. The Task Force has teamed up with these and other organizations to accurately and consistently monitor the subjects post-simulation, especially those at higher risk of depression, anxiety, or other negative mental conditions.
We have received opinion letters from the American Psychiatric Association, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the Depression and Bipolar Alliance, the American Mental Health Counselors Association, and others. These letters support our position that the simulations do not appear to pose a mental health risk to the average American. They recommend that monthly or quarterly check-ups be a required part of this legislation.
You will find these opinion letters in your materials.
The Task Force expects a reduction in negative mental conditions after proper preparation and guidance. Our analysis shows that the percentage of subjects that had a negative mental condition post-simulation is consistent with the overall population, confirming our believe that the simulations would not result in any uptick in the overall depression rate nationwide.
With all that said, we do understand that the intensity of the experience may cause emotions the subjects are not used to feeling. Consequently, we will continue working with public and private institutions to ensure that future subjects are properly monitored and update guidance accordingly.
The Task Force is also proposing a two-to-three-hour monitoring period directly after the simulation, overseen by trained doctors and psychiatrists, to ensure each patient is tracked for potential negative conditions.
All subjects underwent at least two hours of monitoring post-experiment. Only 114 subjects were kept longer than the required two-hour ‘cool down’ period, with 28 of them hospitalized overnight and 14 admitted for a longer period of time for further observation.
All those kept longer were discharged within two weeks, only after receiving clearance from certified physicians and mental health experts who reviewed their reports and determined they posed no harm to themselves or others.
Once individuals could see someone familiar, like a relative, significant other, or friend, their symptoms notably diminished or ceased altogether, so the doctors were comfortable with their conclusions.
The Task Force is also recommending monthly or quarterly mental and physical checkups as a requirement for Anticipation Day to ensure all individuals are healthy enough to go through this experience.
Based on an internal analysis provided to you in the submitted materials, we believe that a decrease in overall healthcare costs will significantly outweigh the cost of these periodic checkups, emphasizing preventative healthcare over reactive healthcare.
To conclude, the Task Force believes that these simulations will allow the average American to have something to look forward to in their life. We hope that every law-abiding citizen will be able to experience this.
We firmly believe this will be a transformative experience for society and eagerly look forward to working with the committee and Congress to finalize this once-in-a-lifetime legislation.”
Joshua took a sip of water before continuing.
“Senators, please recall the time and place at the beginning of my speech and the feeling you had when you had your eyes closed, imagining this place of your choosing.
Our hope today is for you to hold on to that feeling. That feeling of happiness. That feeling of peace. That feeling of anticipation. We want to ensure every American can have that same feeling. We believe this will be a positive, transformative, and life-changing experience.
Thank you for your time and we welcome any questions you may have.”
Applause erupted from those seated in the back. Joshua felt a sense of relief wash over him. He had nailed the speech and gotten through it within the allotted time.
He looked to his right at Neil, who patted him on the back, smiled, and said, “You’re the man. Good job.”
Joshua returned Neil’s smile, bracing himself for the question-and-answer portion of the session, which would turn out to be the longest 90 minutes of his life.
CHAPTER 3
THE DECISION
January 15, 2031
Joshua knew he should have worn something lighter. A black shirt and dark brown shorts were not the best choice on a bright sunny day with temperatures already at 33 degrees Celsius by 11 a.m. Sydney time.
“Oh well,” he thought, taking a sip of water and continuing the never-ending task of stripping weeds from his garden. Unfortunately, the past several months after the committee presentation had been filled with meetings with government officials in Washington and New York, meetings with Neil and his team discussing tweaks they would like to make to the software, and a hundred other meetings that he could barely recall. As a result, everything at his home in Australia had taken a back seat.
With Julie focusing on the kids and schooling and maintaining some semblance of organization inside the house, the outside went by the wayside.
Recent storms had left the yard in a mess. The house needed a power wash, and the garden and landscaping needed a good touchup.
It was a simple house with a beautiful backyard that Joshua loved maintaining, filled with dahlias, roses, and jacaranda bushes mixed with a variety of wildflowers. Bottlebrush, whitegum, and sillyoak trees lined his property, creating a stunning spring bloom. Bushes and flowers surrounded the house, extending all around the sides to the front.
Unfortunately, all of this just created a mess on the ground.
Joshua could have hired someone to do this cleanup, but if he was being honest with himself, he found this work zen-like. After the stress and chaos of the past few years, gardening gave him a sense of peace he hadn’t felt in a long time. The sounds of cockatoos and lorikeets whistling in the morning sun relaxed him, and the feeling of the sun on his skin warmed him. Given he was usually stuck inside most days, getting some natural vitamin D felt rejuvenating.
The buzz of the insects around him brought him back to his childhood and his fascination with bees. It made him feel connected to Mother Nature, even if Mother Nature was an absolute bitch sometimes.
So, after returning to Sydney for the holidays in December and finally spending time with his family through the New Year, Joshua was tasked with the unenviable clean-up that awaited outside of his house.
He was up on a ladder, pruning one of the large sillyoak trees while listening to his favorite band, Audiozine, when his virtual assistant, Sylvia, alerted him to an incoming call.
“Joshua, Claudine Shanley is calling. Would you like to answer it?” Sylvia asked in a deadpan voice that sounded like his mom’s.
“Yes, Sylvia,” Joshua replied as his heart started racing.
“Hi, Claudine. How are you doing today?” He asked as the call went through.
“I’m good, Joshua. Dealing with a snowstorm here in D.C. today,” Claudine said from halfway around the globe. Luckily, technology had improved so much that her voice was as clear as if she were sitting next to him in his yard. “How are you?” She asked.
“Oh, I’m okay—just trying to clean up my yard, which looks like the friggin’ Amazon. The one downfall of traveling the world for the past few years is that I haven’t been able to spend much time with my garden. It’s slightly depressing. I’ll get it cleaned up, but it’s going to take a Herculean effort at this point. Anyway, I’m sure you didn’t call to talk about gardening. What’s the good word? What is it, 9 p.m. in Washington?” Joshua asked, wiping his brow and grabbing shade beneath one of his larger acacia trees.
“Yeah, it’s late, but I just got some news I figured you’d want to hear. I hope you’re sitting down in your garden.” Claudine paused, as if waiting for Joshua to confirm.
“I’m not, but should I be?” Joshua’s voice seemed hesitant.
“You definitely should be. So, I just heard from Bob that we have the votes in the Senate, and they’re voting on it on Monday. Barring a nuclear bomb going off in Washington, this should head to the President next week for his signature!” Claudine’s voice was filled with delight, making Joshua smile instantly.
“Holy shit… I do need to sit down,” he slowly replied. “That’s amazing! Does Bob know what the final bill will look like?”
Claudine took a moment to reply, sounding distracted: “Well, from what I heard, after a ton of back-and-forth, it has about 90% of what we were looking for. Over 21 years of age, unless enrolled in the military, have no recent criminal record, a valid government ID, and no psychiatric conditions in the past five years.
The government will cover 50% of the cost of a subject’s memory recall. I think the goal is to keep the fee under $1,000, which should be doable based on what the new vendor is telling us. So, in total, the participants will be responsible for up to $500. It’s not perfect, but that will be a decision they will have to consider themselves.
They agreed to allow people to skip a year if they desired, but two consecutive skips would require them to reapply to join the program.
They were fine with allowing up to a year of simulated time. There was some pushback from a few senators, but based on our results, they were able to get over the hurdle.
Unfortunately, we lost the privacy battle; all simulations will now be recorded and stored. Republicans were adamant about tracking any potential threats as they popped up. It’s Big Brother at its finest, I guess, but we figured that would happen.
They were also persistent about having an emergency cancellation option, but supported our opinion that participants should be able to redo the simulation if a personal emergency requires them to cancel the simulation.
I agreed. We can’t afford any heart attacks or stress-induced issues coming out of the simulations. And all that other stuff you suggested? Yeah, they went for it.” Claudine paused.
“All of it?” Joshua asked, shocked.
“Well, most of it. There were some tweaks, but the core was yours. So, congratulations. This should become law in the next month or so. I’ll pause there—are you still with me?”
Joshua took a deep breath, trying to process Claudine’s words. “I’m sorry, I’m just speechless.”
“Total win,” Claudine said firmly. “Bob told me your mini-simulation speech at the subcommittee meeting back in March greatly affected the Senators, and they managed to convince their party leadership to at least work with their colleagues to get something done here. Who knew you had a calling as a speechwriter?”
“Ha.” That was all Joshua could muster for a few seconds. “Well, whatever the reason, I’ll take it! So, is that it, then? Is this a done deal?”
“According to Bob, it is,” Claudine answered. “I wanted to be the first to call you and say what an honor it has been to work through this with you. When I first brought this to the Department of Health years ago, I never imagined in my wildest dreams that we would reach the point where it’s ready to become a law in the United States! It’s insane! I couldn’t have asked for a better partner and friend to work with. Your dedication—and Neil’s too—is why we’re here today. Thank you for trusting me and letting me guide you through this process as best I could”
Joshua felt tears welling in his eyes. It was amazing how quickly humans could go from smiling to tears rolling down their cheeks. All the emotions of the past few years since his trip to London seemed to come out simultaneously, and he couldn’t stop them.
“I’m sorry—I just can’t help but cry right now,” he managed amidst the crying and sniffling. Good thing Julie was inside; she would have started crying too, which would have made it worse for him. “Thank you for those kind words, and it has been my pleasure to go through this journey with you.”
He paused briefly and added, “I will tell Julie and the kids. Can I call you on Monday?”
“Of course, Joshua. Enjoy this with your family; you deserve it.”
That was the last thing he heard before the line went dead.
Joshua stood there for what seemed like an hour, gazing up at the sky and thinking about the past few years of his life and what the next chapter of his life would be like. The ups, the downs and the moments of doubt that this program would never come to fruition combined with the sleepless nights and the time away from his family.
All offset by the moments of joy when the team had a breakthrough that worked and the pure elation when they reviewed the survey results together after the initial testing was done.
He was truly part of an amazing team and all of the rollercoasters of emotion they all went through felt worth it at this moment.
Knowing that he was a key part of something that could change the world for the better made him feel a sense of peace and calm that he had never felt before. It was like whatever happened in his life from this point on was icing on the cake. A big, delicious piece of Lamington cake.
While Joshua was excited to see how the deployment of this program would go, he couldn’t help but wonder if everything would go exactly as him and his team thought it would.
As Joshua got to the house, he took a deep breath, composed himself and smiled as he walked inside to share the news with Julie.
CHAPTER 4
THE ROSE GARDEN CEREMONY
February 18, 2031
Dr. Claudine Shanley sat in her chair in the White House Rose Garden on a cool but sunny February afternoon, wrapped in a warm jacket, a wool hat snug over her head, and gloves covering her hands.
This was a day that was a long time coming, and Claudine felt proud and honored to be among the many powerful and influential figures gathered, waiting for the President’s speech. Today’s ceremony followed the official signing of the Anticipation Day bill, formally known as the Advancement of Society and Healthcare Spending Reduction Act (ASHSRA). The name was apropos, though she didn’t really care for it.
Claudine was confident this day would go down in history as a monumental change in the arc of human society. While it was hard to fathom that her work was the reason all of this started, at the end of the day, she was just doing her job. If she hadn’t discovered the initial unusual patterns, someone else would have. Yet, as the saying goes, “Things don’t turn up in this world until somebody turns them up.”
“I guess I’m the somebody,” she thought, staring into the empty space in front of her.
Glancing at her family sitting all around her, their faces beaming with excitement, Claudine’s heart warmed. However, her thoughts kept drifting back to early January 2026, when this journey began.
On January 12, 2026, Claudine sat in her Rockville, Maryland, office completing her normal Monday morning routine: reviewing datasets and summaries from state mental health agencies in order to prepare for weekly debriefs with her team.
Given the data was from right before the holidays, she had expected to see some data that looked unusual. The holidays were often stressful and depressing for many, either from overspending on presents or from spending the holidays alone.
Either way, the diagnosis of depression and anxiety disorders usually spiked in November and December. Claudine would typically contact the relevant states to get their view on the anomalies, scheduling calls for the following week. The issues were typically resolved quickly and the datasets returned to normal.
This time, however, something was off—several data sets were not making sense to her. To boot, the data that was off was in random parts of the country, which, from her experience, was rare.
As Director of the Behavioral Health Crisis Coordinating Office for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Ms. Shanley had seen it all during her 30+ years in the field. From the drug wars of the 1990s to the various mental health issues that confronted the United States after 9/11, she had witnessed almost everything imaginable before her promotion to Director in 2019.
Shortly after taking on this role, the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent societal shutdown, coupled with the rise in social media use among the youth, caused a rise in anxiety and depression rates across the country that had never been seen before.
Most recently, she had been dealing with the growing opioid and fentanyl addiction crisis and its related impact on mental health.
There was never a dull moment in her line of work.
Part of the reason for her promotion to Director was that she and her team were able to identify trends in reported mental health cases across the United States that warranted further investigation, research them to quickly identify the root cause, and develop systematic solutions to prevent further spread.
Most trends they investigated involved periodic spikes attributed to seasonal affective disorder, binge drinking, opioid use disorder, or bipolar disorder.
However, the datasets her team saw in January 2026 involving reports of increases in schizophreniform disorder appeared to be something that she had never encountered before.
In her experience, schizophreniform disorder was typically diagnosed when symptoms of schizophrenia—such as delusions, difficulty concentrating, and decreased participation in daily activities—presented themselves for a period of one to six months. After six months, the diagnosis generally shifted to schizophrenia.
So, when she read the monthly summary from several states noting a tenfold increase in schizophreniform disorder cases compared to the same month the previous year, she paid close attention.
Claudine took further notice when she saw that the average diagnosis period for the reported cases was around three weeks, which contradicted the typical length of time for this diagnosis. The patients were snapping out of exhibiting schizophrenia symptoms and presenting normal behaviors to both doctors and their families within weeks, not months, baffling the entire team.
Historically, when there is both a change in trend data and a fact that goes against current understanding, it indicates something new that requires further investigation. As she followed up on the impacted counties to obtain information about the demographic characteristics of those impacted, blood results, and other tests performed at medical facilities, her antennae raised even more.
From her initial reachout, it was determined that the new cases of this short-term schizophrenia were primarily affecting men and women, mostly over 40, from various wealthy clusters across the United States: New York City, Boston, Austin, Texas, and Silicon Valley, amongst others.
Historically, when she observed wealthy people impacted by mental health issues, it involved some sort of illegal drug: cocaine, acid, LSD, fentanyl, or whatever new drug of the month was causing rich people to lose their minds. However, drug tests for these initial cases did not support this theory, as most patients tested negative for any known substances.
She and her team were initially stumped. Although much about schizophrenia was still unknown, some general trends were widely agreed upon:
Females had a higher prevalence of mental illness than males.
18–25-year-olds had the highest prevalence of mental illness, with the prevalence decreasing with age.
Mixed-race individuals had the highest prevalence of mental illness, followed by American Indians and Caucasians. Individuals identifying as Asian had the lowest prevalence of mental illness.
Higher-income individuals had lower rates of schizophrenia than poor individuals.
Essentially, while older, rich individuals had some risk of developing schizophrenia, they were not generally considered high-risk. So, everything her team was seeing went against the known patterns of the disorder at the time.
Initially, there were theories thrown out suggesting some sort of early-onset dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. However, the percentage of patients with a family history of these conditions was in line with averages for the United States. Additionally, CT or MRI scans showed no brain lesions or brain damage, though a few people did have small tumors that were discovered incidentally.
Other theories involved previously unknown drugs or viruses that were undetectable when the patients presented themselves for testing, but the virologists Claudine contacted dismissed this theory.
So, again, Dr. Shanley and her team were stumped. Personally, she was frustrated, as she prided herself on quickly picking up on a trend and identifying potential causes.
By February 2026, similar schizophrenia episodes were reported in 15 states, with over 2,500 individuals affected. She then received clearance to conduct a full investigation to determine what was driving this increase. The summary findings she reviewed were perplexing.
The night she read the summary in early March 2026, sitting in her bed with a glass of Cabernet by her side, she was overwhelmed by the magnitude of its implications.
That report, now engrained deep in her memory, was presented to the late President Logan later that month.
Though the investigative process eventually uncovered the root cause, she couldn’t shake the thought that if her team had identified it sooner, they could have helped more people. By the time corrective actions could be taken, over 500,000 people had been diagnosed with schizophrenic disorder.
She hoped the long-term impacts of these cases would be minimal, though it was hard to say. Despite doing everything “by the book” and informing department leadership as quickly as possible, she still felt it wasn’t fast enough.
Regardless of how she felt, her journey to the Rose Garden ceremony was long and personal. A journey that eventually led to President Randolph signing the legislation this afternoon.
A police siren brought Claudine back into the present. She turned to her boyfriend, Charles, who was sitting beside her, and smiled. Behind her, her two daughters, Eva and Monica, chatted with their husbands and children about where they wanted to go eat after the ceremony.
Claudine was so happy to have her family with her today. They were the reason she did everything and they fully supported her journey to get here today, even with all of the scrutiny on her and her team’s work over the past several months.
As she turned back and looked at Charles, she smiled and once again got lost in her thoughts.
Claudine had lost her husband to cancer three years ago, in the middle of this entire process. After a long period of mourning, she finally got up the courage, with her daughter’s insistence, to join a popular dating app called Higher Connections, where all of the people on the app were cannabis users. One of the dates through this app resulted in her meeting Charles, a widower who had lost his wife to a car accident 18 months ago.
They bonded over their shared grief, and eventually, their friendship became romantic. Six months later, they were still together, and she was happy he was here. She needed a rock today, and he was it.
Her work to finalize the Anticipation Day bill led to much public attention for Claudine, which, given her introverted nature, was difficult for her. Claudine’s family supported her as best they could, but there was only so much they could do. The committee presentations available to the public plastered her face on every news channel and media outlet across the country. Calls flooded in: TV show bookings, media spots, speaking engagements, and even a book deal. Forced to hire a publicist and not see her family for weeks, she worked tirelessly with House of Representatives and Senate members to finalize key parts of the legislation.
While not as popular as Michael Jackson in the 1980s, Michael Jordan in the 1990s, or Taylor Swift a decade earlier, she was still a face people recognized in public.
It was one of the reasons she had asked Dr. Joshua Lee to deliver one of the final presentations to the Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence a year ago. She needed a break from the limelight, and he was up to the task. She appreciated Joshua for stepping up to give that speech.
Some days, she still wondered how this could happen to a girl from Asheville, North Carolina.
Meeting the late President Logan back in 2026 was one of the most nerve-racking, yet coolest, experiences of her life. It was rare for a federal agency director to interact directly with a President, at least in one-on-one meetings.
Though most of that day was a blur, the 60-minute conversation with President Logan was fully engrained in her memory. He was genuinely interested in getting her thoughts on the situation, strategies to confront the root cause, and the level of support she needed to develop an alternative solution. Despite his reputation as a selfish and narcissistic guy who didn’t care about the average American, her interactions with him suggested otherwise.
President Logan had always supported the foundation of this bill, even if it was tough to discern his true motives. While she believed he supported the program to benefit the average American, a small part of her suspected that he wanted to take credit for the program himself.
Nevertheless, his administration consistently provided support and funding, so he deserved all the credit for getting the bill to this point today.
Unfortunately, President Logan was assassinated in February 2027 and was quickly replaced by Vice President Randolph, a new-generation Republican leader who had been elected to the office of Vice President just a month earlier after former Vice President Ruff’s forced resignation due to a bribery scandal that ended his political career.
Before his vice presidency, President Randolph had served as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, and was known for his tireless work to help shift the country to nuclear and other renewables as part of President Logan’s push for a zero-net-carbon society by 2045.
Even though President Randolph was a Republican, he was able to win favor with some Democrats due to his scientific background and general respect for science to guide proper policy.
In a short span, President Randolph had gone from head of the EPA to the most powerful man in the world. His first huge task was taking over President Logan’s work on the Anticipation Day Bill.
The assassination, unexpectedly, seemed to finally bring the country together. Extremists on both sides turned down the heat enough to cool temperatures, allowing politicians to work together again. Talking heads on both sides of the aisles stressed unity and compromise rather than division. It was a strange yet productive time in Washington, D.C.
Jeff Michelson
Anticipation Day
38 ratings","Wow! What a unique idea for a book?!? This was an interesting read from a first-time author named Jeff Michelson. The book, Anticipation Day, is a futuristic novel about a simulation project the government has instituted for the American public. Once guidelines are met, citizens can take a day, week, month, or year simulation to escape their everyday lives. The government hopes this will boost morale, lessen crime, and diminish cases of mental illness. The story follows a group of friends as they experience their simulations and then return to their regular lives. I really enjoyed reading about how this simulation process worked and the simulations the characters chose to go through. Each character was well developed and had their own unique circumstances that they were trying to work through. I liked how the simulation process helped the majority of them work through their personal problems. This book made me think of what I would pick and how it would help me face my own issues. I rate Anticipation Day by Jeff Michelson a four out of five stars since I really enjoyed the storyline of this book. I took one star off for the typos that I found in the book. There were a few of them but I didn't think that it took away from the storyline. There was some profanity and sexual content in the story. If you tend to stay away from those things, I would not recommend this book to you. I do think those who like futuristic stories would enjoy this series. I look forward to seeing what Mr. Michelson comes up with for his next novel. He has a very imaginative knack for writing stories. I have seen other reviews mentioning this book would be a cool concept for a television series or movie and I absolutely agree!"

Prologue
She was exhausted, but she needed to hunt again now if her litter was to survive. She crept out of the den to begin her task as she had done so many times before.
Their den was well concealed, but now that her kits had grown, so had their voices. They were famished, the poor things, so you could hardly blame them for mewing so loudly, but little did they realise the danger in which they put themselves. Only last week a crow had carried off the youngest: she shuddered to think about it.
She knew she would have to take her chances and seek prey at the farmyard again. If she could avoid the dog, the chicks provided easy pickings.
When she finally got to the farmyard, she was in luck. The hens were out of their pen wandering around, chicks trailing after them. It was over in a trice; a flurry of feathers was all there was to show for the missing chick’s whereabouts. She hurried back with the meagre fare, eagerly awaited by her hungry offspring. Sharp little teeth ground through soft bone and cartilage, not even the extremities of the unfortunate fowl remaining unconsumed.
As she watched, her heart grew heavy. Endangering herself to provide for them conflicted with her instinct for self-preservation and yet something kept driving her to take greater and greater risks on their behalf. The almost mutually exclusive instincts constantly warred within her, each vying for dominance. Soon, she knew she would go. All she could leave them were the names she had given them — nothing more. She wondered if the little orange kit would survive on his own, given that his coat made him so visible.
Be safe, Bushytail! she thought. Nature is a cruel taskmaster.
Bushytail was always ravenous. The volumes of lizards, mice and birds he was able to catch provided subsistence sustenance only. It also took a lot of energy for Bushytail to catch his prey, resulting in a physique that was both lean and muscular.
Daily, Bushytail faced a myriad of dangers. Larger predators such as foxes were a threat, as were other feral toms, and then there was the omnipresent danger posed by humans, many of whom, for a variety of reasons, wanted to eradicate feral cats. He had cleverly camouflaged the entrance to his den in a thicket of blackberry bushes to provide a measure of security during his brief sojourns, but it paid to be vigilant at all times.
When Bushytail was a kit, he lived with his mother and siblings, but at a young age he had had to learn the solitary behaviours he now practiced. A wild mother cat couldn’t provide for herself and her kits for very long, but at least she had given him his name, derived from her remembrance of his bushy tail.
Bushytail had only briefly lamented the loss of companion­ship his family had provided, but oftentimes, when he caught the scent of other cats, he felt lonely. When he was old enough and strong enough, he would contest other toms for territory and have a family of his own, but in the meantime, he would hunt and sleep and bide his time. With each passing day he grew wilier. He became bolder in his quest for food, drawing nearer and nearer human habitation, and reaping the rich rewards these opportunities offered.
The depth of winter was no time to travel, but soon, he would have to leave these lands and find his own territory.
Chapter One:
A New Beginning
Bushytail felt strong and confident. Spring was in the air and the privations of winter almost a memory. His belly was full and the sun warm as he stretched out his limbs. He looked around at the scrubby country that was his home. The trees were low and stunted, allowing the plants underneath to flourish. There were any number of strappy plants and ferns and the occasional grasstree. It looked more lovely to him than it had for some time, and he felt a pang of regret that he may not see it again.
It was easy to live in the moment at times like this, but Bushytail knew that it wasn’t time for rest and relaxation. All winter he had been plagued by hunger and the threat of attack from other toms and now it was time to move on. The warmer months were better for travelling, as he would be able to find food more easily on his journey and the need for shelter wasn’t as great. Besides which, he was looking forward to the adventure.
Living as an outsider in someone else’s territory was simply existence, not living. He wanted to be the master of his own domain, with a family and a clowder. Apart from the lack of space here for the growing population of feral cats, there was also the problem that this land was increasingly home to more and more humans. They were exceedingly dangerous, and he wanted to be as far away from them as possible.
Starting out, however, wasn’t as easy as it sounded. The reason no one ever left was that this territory was surrounded by obstacles: the farmland on one side, an expansive concrete river on the other, and on the third an enormous pathway for the smelly machines.
Bushytail had been considering which direction to take for days.
The concrete river seemed the least dangerous, but it was very strange. It had slippery sides that made it impossible to get a paw-grip. From time to time some unfortunates had fallen in by mistake and none had returned. The farmland was good for a daring cat, as there was easy food to be found; however, that was the direction from which all the humans seemed to come, and Bushytail was sure there would be many more of them in the lands beyond. That only left the enormous pathway for the machines, and even though just as many of his kin had died there, it seemed as if it was the only option.
There was an inviting stretch of bushland on the other side of the pathway that awaited any cat who could figure out the secret of traversing the frightening obstacle. I know I can do it! Bushytail told himself.
Cats weren’t the only creatures that had attempted crossing this pathway. There were a number of kangaroos, koalas and birds lying dead along the causeway, delighting only the crows. Granted, cats may be swift, but the fast-paced machines seemed to come out of nowhere, and any contact with them was deadly. Bushytail wasn’t sure that he wanted to risk himself by relying on his speed to cross. He thought that there must be another solution to get across the pathway, and he’d spent many weeks watching and waiting.
Recently, he had noticed some humans behaving strangely. For a reason he couldn’t comprehend, they were building some kind of structure across the deadly path. It had two tall pillars on either side, connected by a long beam with cages at intervals. Inside the cages were bright things like stars flashing. The structure wasn’t large enough for humans to use as a crossing, and he wondered why they would go to the effort of making it. He had memories of his mother warning him of the dangers humans posed, and he was taking no chances. Seeking an opportunity to examine the structure more closely, he watched and waited, keeping his distance.
After the humans left one evening, he examined the structure carefully. Unfortunately, it was built out of strange materials like the river but much more slippery. Even so, Bushytail still thought it was his best escape route, and he felt confident in his strength and agility to cross to safety.
He had dreamed of escape for weeks, convincing himself that beyond lay salvation: a land that had plentiful prey, even in winter. With an optimism granted only to youth, he imagined himself accomplishing great deeds, fighting great battles and winning great victories. He wasn’t a vain cat, but it was natural for one so young to dream of great things to come. So, with this frame of mind, he decided it was time to attempt the crossing.
Today was the day. No more delays.
Bushytail approached the gantry cautiously, sniffing, but the humans were long gone, and the strange structure gave off no scent. Although it was early morning, the noisy machines that went along the path never stopped. He was determined to try his plan of crossing using the structure the humans had made. Getting up would be easier than getting down. There was an overhanging tree on this side of the road. He climbed up and prepared to spring. The large bushy feature for which he was named swished in anticipation as he attempted to balance and take flight. He landed lightly, but slipped slightly on the cold, unyielding surface. Nevertheless, he managed to keep his footing and focused on the beam in front of him.
He was distracted by the constant thrum that came from the machines and the smell emanating from them. He needed nerves of steel, so pushed any other thoughts aside to focus on the oasis on the other side. Eyes firmly forward, he relied on his natural grace as he walked a straight line no wider than a kit’s head. Although he was a skilled climber, the surface was so unstable that each time he placed his paw, there was no margin for error at all. He didn’t let himself think about the danger if he fell, and instead did what cats did best: he lived in the now. His concentration was bent entirely on the placement of his paws, excluding all else.
He didn’t at first notice the putrid stench that began to overcome him. For some reason, an enormous rumbler, much bigger than the rest, had stopped directly beneath him. On its roof, it had a pipe that spewed forth filth. Bushytail could hardly breathe and dropped to a crouch. It was much more difficult to balance in this position, and with the miasma making him weak, he feared to move forward. Self-doubt assailed him, and he began an internal dialogue of self-beration: Why do I attempt this when all others have failed? What is wrong with where I came from anyway? Bushytail knew that his chance of reaching the other side was greatly diminished without his self-belief, and so he tried to put the negative thoughts aside.
Fortunately, the enormous machine moved away, allowing him some respite, and he was able to refocus. It will pass. Focus. You can do it, he told himself. The noise of the machines that kept moving under him, however, still assailed him. Like all cats, Bushytail was proud of his sensitive hearing, but in this situation, it was extremely difficult for him to think clearly with all the noise.
Regaining his composure, he rose and continued as quickly as prudence would allow. He once again focused only on putting one paw in front of the other until he reached the pillar on the far side. By this time, he was trembling, imagining what might have happened had fate not intervened, and he felt dizzy and nauseous from inhaling the fumes.
Although he wasn’t normally scared by heights alone, in his current condition, the view from his position added to his dizziness. He shut his eyes and focused on centring his balance on the precarious perch, making the most of the brief rest this stance afforded him.
He decided to attempt the descent by dangling his back legs off the edge and trying to wrap all four paws around the pillar to slow himself. Cats usually relied on digging their claws into the surface to climb down a tree, but that wasn’t possible given the impenetrable hardness of the pole. Gracelessly, he landed at the bottom with a thud. His heart raced with elation. I’ve done it! I’m on the other side!
He was exhausted and shaking all over. His limbs felt like jelly, and he desperately needed somewhere to rest. He had no energy to go farther. The strange structure seemed to absorb the heat of the day, and right now he found its warmth comforting. He curled himself in a ball in an indentation at the base of the pillar and fell asleep immediately.
Bushytail awoke hours later to find himself huddled against an icy mass, disoriented and alone. Shaking himself awake, he assessed his situation. He had planned to begin his journey in the glorious warmth of a spring day, enjoying the new scenery stretching before him. Of course, cats often travelled at night, having excellent night vision, but most tended to be crepuscular, that is, most active at dawn and dusk. There was no food to be had in the middle of the night and no way to see what might lie further afield to give him a sign by which he might steer. Nevertheless, Bushytail felt it was best to move away from the machines and set off, trusting to luck.
His encounter over the pathway had unsettled him more than he cared to admit. His great adventure had only just begun, and due to his lack of experience and foresight, he had nearly fallen at the first hurdle. He was flighty, jumping at the small unidentified night noises and the wind whistling in his ears. After a time, his nerves settled and he began to feel reassured by the familiar smells of the bushland, its plants and creatures. The night sky was clear and the air crisp and invigorating. The strength had returned to his muscles, and he revelled in the feel of them moving in unison to propel him.
Shortly, however, his thoughts turned to water, and he realised that he did, in fact, have a raging thirst and a sore throat, probably on account of the foul air he had inhaled. He headed downhill, reasoning that that would be his best chance of finding a water source. It wasn’t long before he could hear the familiar sounds telling him that a watercourse was indeed nearby, but being experienced in such matters, he didn’t rush in to drink without looking, knowing that water attracted all kinds of other creatures.
The moon emerged briefly from a grey coat for just long enough for him to see that he had reached a wide bend in the river, which appeared almost as a lake, surrounded by impressive rotund river gums. The moonlight shimmered on its surface invitingly and he approached carefully, using all of his senses to confirm that the coast was clear. When he was sure that there was no scent of other cats or humans nearby, he crouched and lapped the water greedily.
Sated, he moved soundlessly into the understory and surveyed the scene. As he sat there, he took in the beauty of the country in which he found himself. Beyond the watery vista towered tall mountains, reflected perfectly in the pond’s surface. The plants were all ones he knew, but the trees had become taller, shooting so far into the sky that he couldn’t see their tops. It was a big country and a big sky, and he suddenly felt very small.
He searched for somewhere safe to rest for what was left of the night. Lone toms were vulnerable when sleeping and finding a temporary place to rest for an evening was an undertaking that required careful consideration. Bushytail had unusual colouring, light fur with an orange tinge, which stood out in the mute colours of the bushland, and therefore he had to take care that he was well hidden. Thorn bushes often provided good cover, but a cat had to be careful that they weren’t already occupied.
Being extra cautious, Bushytail opted to climb a tree. This wasn’t the usual preferred sleeping place for a cat, but Bushytail had excellent balance and, as this was unknown territory, considered it the safest option. Being lean, he was able to climb up a good way and still find strong boughs to support him. Although the tree didn’t do much to provide camouflage, from experience he knew that predators rarely looked up: particularly humans.
As the tree branches gently swayed, lulling him towards sleep, he finally had a chance to reflect on his success. He had taken a huge risk today crossing the path of the noisy machines. It was the first time in his short life that he had done anything so daring. In fact, as he was a very young tom, he had really not done much yet other than avoid danger, hunt and find safe places to sleep.
He had been vaguely excited by the idea of what might be awaiting him in the vast bushland, but he hadn’t really given much thought as to what to do once he got here or what possible dangers he might face. He decided that he needed more information and made up his mind to go looking for it tomorrow. Are there cats nearby? Humans? What dangers will I encounter? He was keen to test his strength against another tom in a real fight, but he had no desire to seriously injure any cat in the process. His exhaustion eventually outweighed his curiosity, and he continued his meandering thoughts through the pathways of his dreams, the sensations only serving to heighten his desire.
He woke with a longing to start his adventure.
Chapter Two:
Well Met, Stranger
Dawn was fast approaching, heralded by the onset of the early carollers. With interest, Bushytail observed the world awakening and in particular the many birds seeking the water source. As tempting as it was to make a sudden lunge in an attempt to catch one, he held still, waiting for the right moment, only to find another cat easily as big as himself make the catch gracefully, mid-air, avoiding the treacherous slide into the river. However, Bushytail remained still, hoping to stay unseen to give him time to weigh up his options.
He then decided that attack was the best form of defence and reasoned that catching this unknown cat off-guard while he was absorbed with his prey would give Bushytail the advantage. The other cat was heading his way and would pass directly beneath him. All he had to do was wait for the right moment to strike. He planned to spring onto his opponent’s back, sharp claws digging in, and teeth latched on. He knew that it would be difficult to dislodge him from this position; the effort would be sure to tire his adversary.
Inexplicably, however, he went sailing through the air, missing his target altogether. He landed awkwardly, making an horrendous noise: his presence announced to all and sundry. To his surprise, the cat didn’t press his advantage, instead asking him a question.
‘Who are you?’ the stranger asked him.
Bushytail knew that this could just be a tactic to buy time, but he found himself responding anyway. ‘I’m an outsider. I walk alone.’
‘Stranger, I am no threat to you. Walk on by,’ came the response. There was no sense of fear or anxiety in the voice. The strange cat exuded confidence and calmness.
‘Stranger I may be, but not so green as to turn my back to you,’ replied Bushytail.
‘Then let me,’ said the stranger, and he turned and walked away.
The strange cat could have done nothing that would have surprised him more greatly. Were all the rules changed in this country that toms would simply let one another pass? How did I miss my opponent in the first place? Although he was inexperienced in fighting, he knew his reflexes were good and that his blow should have found its mark. The stranger had not even paused to retrieve the prey he had caught.
Warily, Bushytail eyed the fallen prey. He maintained his crouch for a full five minutes, using all his senses to detect the return of the hunter who had felled the prize, but eventually hunger won out and he devoured the creature rapidly. The feeling of a full belly quickly dispelled the uneasiness he had been experiencing. The sun was warm, but not too hot, and the temptation to bask was great, but he knew that while the sun was high, he needed to find a vantage point from which to get his bearings.
So, he started travelling uphill.
It wasn’t difficult terrain, but being out of his known territory, he flitted from tree to tree and the journey took much longer than it might have ordinarily. By the time he reached the summit, his muscles ached. Licking his paws, he looked out to behold the most amazing sight he had ever seen: a sea of trees as far as the eye could see. He had never imagined such an oasis existed. Surely there would be room in this vast tract of land for him. Bushytail was startled out of his wonder by a familiar voice.
‘Well met, stranger.’
He couldn’t believe his incaution. The tom must have tracked him and now came on him unawares.
‘Why have you followed me?’ demanded Bushytail.
‘Nay, stranger, I did not follow you,’ came the cryptic reply.
To his dismay, Bushytail saw that he was now surrounded by a motley-looking crew of toms. From the wide variety of markings they bore, they didn’t appear to be a clowder. It was very unusual for toms to work together, and he cursed his luck that he had stumbled upon a group that looked to have a unified purpose.
‘It seems that you have, albeit unknowingly, stumbled upon our stronghold. As you know, stray toms are often shunned by clowders, and existing as a loner can be dangerous. We decided our best chance of survival was to band together, and this rocky outcrop is the place we call home. You are in our territory now.’
‘Safety in numbers, you say? I can’t argue with that, given the position I’m in! What do you intend to do?’ Bushytail inquired.
‘That depends on you. The choice is yours: go or stay.’
Bushytail quickly considered his options. He didn’t want to give up his quest so quickly, but he needed knowledge of this new land, and perhaps this strange band of misfits could supply him with that knowledge. ‘Thank you,’ he replied, ‘as strange as your offer is, I believe I could use your help and you mine. I will stay.’
‘Well chosen,’ came the reply.
In turn, the cats introduced themselves. In the manner of their kind, all had names that referred to their physical attributes: Bristle, Claws, Squat and Brokenear. All except one, the smallest tom, who went by the name of Watcher. Although they banded together when necessary, they still preferred solitude, and each had their own den with its own entrance in the pile of rocks and brambles. The plateau provided a natural defence, as it was easy to see anyone or anything approaching. They shared hunting duties in order for someone to always maintain a watch. They even offered to hunt for Bushytail while he made a den for himself. He was glad to accept the offer and have a safe place to sleep for the night, as he had still not fully recovered from the effects of the foul air that he had inhaled on the gantry. He spent the day making a hollow indentation, well protected by rocks and thorn bushes and lined with dry grasses.
When dusk fell, the hunters returned. Birds were abundant in these highlands and there was plenty for all. Bushytail explained to his companions that the small territory from which he had come was getting smaller each day due to the arrival of more humans. They marvelled that he had passed over the noisy machines. One of the reasons they had their outpost here was that it was so close to the concrete pathway that others feared to come near.
They told him that there were two big clowders in this area: River Clowder and Tree Clowder. Last spring had been kind and many kits were born, but with the onset of winter, there were too many mouths to feed, and some of the older toms had to leave. Squat and Claws were from River Clowder, and Watcher was from Tree Clowder. Brokenear was from a place far to the east, filled with humans. Bristle was their leader, as he had arrived first and, as Bushytail had already noted, had an air of confidence that compelled others to do his bidding. Bristle didn’t say from which direction he had travelled.
As the days passed and Bushytail settled into a routine in his new life, he found that he very much enjoyed the companion­ship he was experiencing for the first time. Toms were solitary creatures, but with that also came deprivation and hardship. The mild spring weather combined with the reduced need to hunt resulted in ample leisure time, which was generally spent with his companions, and the young cats, having no responsibilities, frolicked and generally wasted their time — and relished doing so. Never before had Bushytail been carefree, and he was grateful for the humour his new companions provided.
Squat and Claws usually hunted together, as did Brokenear and Watcher, while Bristle kept watch. Brokenear, however, often complained loudly about the ineptitude of his partner, so Bushytail most often joined this pair, as much as to lend support to the little fellow as to help to equal the amount of prey brought in by the other party. During these long periods where they hunted together, Bushytail came to know his companions well.
Brokenear was continually haughty, with an overblown sense of entitlement. Bushytail got the feeling that Brokenear thought the others well beneath him. Brokenear told tales of wonder about the place he had left as a kit. There were thousands of humans, and all the surfaces were hard like the noisy machine path and the strange river. There were houses taller than trees. Brokenear was born on the streets of this place, but he said there were some cats who lived with the humans and let the humans touch them! Bushytail didn’t think that he would like to journey there.
Brokenear didn’t hide his leadership ambitions, telling Bushytail at length about how he was going to find a clowder and challenge for leadership. He plied the toms from River Clowder and Tree Clowder with questions, clearly seeking information that would help him best choose where to make a challenge.
Bushytail’s companions taught him how to hunt cooperatively; a concept with which he was wholly unfamiliar if indeed it had ever been done before in catkind history. With more than one cat hunting the same prey, one or more cats could flush out the prey and direct it into the waiting paws at the designated place. In addition, being clowderless, the toms had no kits or elderly for which to provide, resulting in an abundance of food the likes of which Bushytail had never experienced.
Despite the ease of this lifestyle, Bushytail still felt discontent. He had always imagined that nothing could be more important than a full belly. Indeed, when one was hungry, there was little consideration of anything else, but once this goal had been achieved, the soul still hungered. While he had companionship, it wasn’t the same as having family and clowder. There were no she-cats here and no kits. Nevertheless, he was in no hurry to forgo the convenience of his current situation and pushed down his feelings of unease.
In the evenings, they generally sat together, sharing the day’s hunt and exchanging stories.
Squat and Claws weren’t far from the lands where they had been born and were the least worried about their rogue status in their clowder. It was usual for young toms to go off on their own for a while when they were young and see the world. The pair were fast friends and had a carefree attitude, which made them very good company.
On the occasions when Bushytail did join the pair for hunting, the three companions had great fun with mock battles, delighting in surprising one another or putting obstacles in one another’s paths, and laughing with good humour when one of their pranks resulted in someone losing their balance. Bushytail had parted with his siblings when he was very young and revelled in the frivolity of these young companions.
True to his name, Watcher didn’t contribute overly to the evening’s conversations. He had left Tree Clowder due to his small size, which prevented him from fulfilling hunting duties as well as other cats, and he had no plans to reclaim a clowder for himself. Of all the toms in the company, he was the only member resigned to remaining an ‘outsider’.
As the others circled to converse, Watcher did indeed cut a forlorn figure, and as such, Bushytail was drawn to him. He felt a need to protect him and help him find a way to overcome his difficulties. He spent many hours at his side in silence, comforting merely with his presence. Slowly but surely, a bond grew between them, and the shy little tom looked upon Bushytail with adoring eyes whenever he appeared. Watcher took to following Bushytail around camp, trying to anticipate his needs and bringing him the best cuts of meat: all for a little kindness.
Bristle remained as much of a mystery as ever. He often sat alone at the lookout point, seemingly staring at nothing. He was always courteous but was never warm to his companions. He would give them advice about where to look for prey when the hunting was difficult, or on occasion interject in an argument when tempers became frayed, but he didn’t give much away about himself.
Nevertheless, Bushytail couldn’t help but admire Bristle’s composure. He seemed to have no need for the company or the hunting skills of his companions, as he was a masterful hunter. Indeed, Bushytail wondered why Bristle remained with the rag-tag little company. When Bushytail pressed him for answers, Bristle simply told him that he had a purpose, and he had no choice but to follow the path laid out for him. This answer, however, didn’t satisfy Bushytail at all.
Brokenear, on the other hand, was happy to answer Bushytail’s questions.
‘When do you think you will set out to find a clowder, Brokenear? Surely you are strong enough now to take on any challenger?’ Bushytail questioned.
‘There is more to being a leader than just being strong. I certainly don’t intend to be fighting constant battles to keep my leadership. If we can work together to make our life easier, surely a clowder could also? I think I can use the things we have learnt hunting together to make a clowder stronger.’
Bushytail was intrigued.
By the end of spring, Bushytail was at peak fitness. He was no longer lean, his elongated frame having been built up with muscle. The playfights with Squat and Claws, combined with the daily traversing of the high-country terrain, had ensured that his days of leisure didn’t overly impact his physical abilities in a negative way. His coat was shiny, glossy and well groomed. He felt that there was nothing he couldn’t accomplish. He took to roaming the perimeter of the camp by himself of a morning and evening, gazing at the vista, and wondering what lay beyond. Watcher would sometimes accompany him. The quiet and unobtrusive nature of his companion suited his mood, and Watcher seemed to appreciate Bushytail’s need for companionship.
At times, Bushytail found himself telling Watcher things he had never told any other cat, almost as if he was talking to himself. He told him of his siblings and his mother, and the stress of being hungry and cold. He told him of his longing to find a mate and to be part of a clowder where he would protect elders and kits. He told him of his adventures and hopes and dreams, and in doing so, perhaps began to understand himself a little better, growing in wisdom as well as stature. As time went by, it was rare for the two to be apart, the symbiotic relationship being beneficial to both parties as they gained strength and healed.
On occasions, the pair was joined by Bristle. He too seemed to take comfort in silence as they sat on the peak of the mountain with the late evening sun blanketing them with its soft diffused light and the gentle breeze blowing on their faces. Squat and Claws had told Bushytail that they found the sight of the three statues silhouetted against the sky amusing and that they had no idea what possible solace a cat found in this absurd activity. The only time Squat and Claws would stay still was to stalk prey, and then only for as long as was absolutely necessary.
Nevertheless, Bushytail valued the diversity of his companions and the different aspects of life that his experiences with them offered. They were an odd band, but he was growing fond of them all in different ways. The only one he was still not sure about was Brokenear. There was something about him that was unsettling.
It was the end of yet another day, and the disparate members of the company were enjoying the rewards of a good day’s hunting. They had eaten well and were stretching and grooming themselves as the sun set.
Unusually, it was Watcher who began the conversation this evening. ‘There’s been a strange smell on the air these past few days. It’s like the smell of the noisy machines has become stronger. Have you smelt it?’
‘Don’t be ridiculous!’ mocked Brokenear. ‘You jump at the sight of your own shadow. There are no pathways here large enough for the noisy machines. It is your imagination playing tricks on you, my worthless excuse for a hunting partner.’
Bushytail was naturally protective of his new-found friend. How dare you speak to him like that, he thought, but before he had a chance to leap to Watcher’s defence, Bristle interjected.
‘Nay, Watcher sees what is. It is true. The humans are drawing near. You would do well to heed our observant friend.’
‘I am not scared of humans,’ boasted Brokenear. ‘Many of them passed me every day when I was a kit, without even noticing me. They pose no danger.’
Squat and Claws declared that they had had no interactions with humans, and they weren’t sure who to believe about the possible threat.
‘Tree Clowder is closer to the humans than River Clowder,’ explained Watcher. ‘I know stories about humans that would make even Brokenear’s hair curl.’
‘Pah!’ Brokenear spat. ‘Why should we listen to someone as worthless as you? No one wants you. I suggest you grow a backbone.’
At this point in the conversation, Bushytail had the distinct feeling (and not for the last time) that he didn’t like Brokenear. He motioned to Watcher to leave the group, and they walked away without responding to the taunt.
Rather than dwell on it, Bushytail decided to query Watcher further about the humans.
‘How close are they?’ he asked. ‘Do you think they could come onto our territory?’
‘They can do anything they like,’ replied Watcher with sincerity. ‘They aren’t rational creatures. They don’t seek land or prey; they just rampage at will. Please, Bushytail, take my advice and steer well clear of them.’
‘I will, my friend, I promise. I will.’
By the time they made their way back to camp it was very late, and Bushytail went straight to his den. Watcher, however, sat up a while longer, standing guard not far away from where Bushytail slept.
Many hours later, when the sun began to rise, Bushytail found Watcher still at his post.
‘Have you slept? Is the danger so great that we must post a constant guard?’ Bushytail asked.
‘I slept,’ came the reply. ‘We might not need a constant guard, but we should definitely be on guard.’
They stayed close that day, but when nothing happened, they relaxed and thought that perhaps, after all, they were mistaken.
Chapter Three:
Prudence is the Greater
Part of Valour
Bushytail was in a hunting party with Squat and Claws. He was larger than many cats, but still able to move soundlessly when needed. He had become accustomed to hunting with others. Typically, Squat and Claws would flush out the prey and Bushytail would launch the attack. Food was becoming less easy to find, but today they were lucky. Two rabbits darted out, and as quick as a flash, Bushytail was after one.
Success in catching rabbits lay in the element of surprise, as cats were no match for rabbits in an open race. This one might have got away, except for the help of his companions. Being skittish creatures, the rabbits practically jumped into Bushytail’s paws when the other two cats appeared. As the cats who made the kill, it was acceptable that they ate the choice parts of the rabbits first and then took the rest back for the others. Between the three of them the meat was soon divided into manageable parts that could be carried in their mouths.
Watcher and Brokenear had also had success hunting, bringing a snake back to camp. As the weather was turning colder, the snakes were often found soaking up the sunshine on rocks.
As always when hunting had been good, spirits were high, but there was still an air of discontent in the group. Life had been easy over the summer, and they all felt safe and secure, but the main reason for a tom to grow strong was to fight and win territory. All of them clearly felt the urge to move on and find a mate. Even Watcher was looking fit and rested after the bountiful summer.
Bushytail had silently resolved to travel south in the spring. He intended to find a clowder and hopefully a mate. It was true that he was large and strong, but he had other advantages that he considered more important. There were many large, strong cats who sought to join a clowder, but he had discovered that winning respect and fostering cooperation also went a long way to ensuring success.
That night, each tom eventually made his way to his own den, curling into a tight ball against the oncoming chill of the night. It seemed the milder weather had come to an abrupt end, as sometimes happens in the high country, with no warning as to the gradual changing of the seasons.
And as abruptly as the weather changed, so did the pattern of their reasonably uneventful lives.
Bushytail shivered through the night and woke early, deciding he needed to move to warm up. As he headed to the entrance of his den, he saw the strangest sight. Everything was white, covered by ice falling from the sky. He had never seen anything like it before. Tentatively, he reached out a paw. The white powder coating everything was soft and cold to touch.
As he stepped out, he beheld with wonder the delicate patterns in the powder on his fur. He took a few nervous steps, noticing the tracks he left behind. He would have to be careful with his footing, but the white covering was not deep. With excitement and trepidation, he set out, slipping and sliding as he went, making his way slowly and carefully along the track.
The appearance of the white covering of ice reminded him how little he had seen of the world and the great many things he might yet experience. It was nice to be out in the silence walking alone once again. The surrounding whiteness gave him a sense of isolation, peacefulness and quietness, while at the same time the falling flakes that swirled around heightened his sense of excitement and expectation.
He sniffed the air. The smell of the noisy machines was very strong here.
Drawn to continue, he crawled along until he came to a clearing that was bordered by an enormous rockface on the opposite side. In the clearing sat four humans around a circle of rocks, and from the rocks sprang red tongues leaping higher with every gust of wind. The humans huddled close to the circle. They were making loud noises: talking, laughing and drinking. They seemed to have constructed some shelters nearby, and they had a noisy machine with them, although it wasn’t turned on. Bushytail had had no idea that a noisy machine could leave its pathway, and the thought filled him with fear, but he was still curious to go closer.
Watcher had warned him not to go near the humans, but Brokenear had said that they were not so bad. They certainly didn’t seem threatening; they were obviously having a good time, joking and laughing. He had observed humans from a distance before, when they were making the structure over the noisy machine pathway, but he had never dared to go close to them. In his own mind, he justified his decision to creep further forward by telling himself that he needed to know more about them firsthand instead of relying on the accounts told to him by others. Slowly, he crept from shadow to shadow, until he could smell the food they were eating.
It was exhilarating being so close. He watched them in fascination, drawing ever closer. Then he saw Watcher. He crouched undetected just outside the circle of light that emanated from the gathering. A feeling of dread crept over Bushytail again, but he firmly pushed it down. He was no coward. He resolved not to be scared just by the mere sight of humans. If Watcher could get close enough to watch them, so could he.
He could see Watcher’s eyes fixed on him, urging him to retreat.
No doubt, the little tom had been scouting in order to warn him. Bushytail felt indignant that his friend should consider him so helpless that he needed protection, and he was determined to show his bravery. Watcher again attempted to signal to Bushytail to go away, with wilder and wilder gestures.
Perhaps thinking that Bushytail hadn’t seen him, Watcher let out a wail.
Immediately, all four humans looked directly at Watcher, detecting his presence.
After that, everything happened quickly.
One of the humans picked up a stick and pointed it at Watcher. There was a loud bang and Watcher fell down. In a matter of seconds, he was silent, and a red stain began to spread from his small body, a stark contrast to the ground’s white covering. Watcher had achieved his goal: the wail had focused the attention of all four humans on Watcher, giving Bushytail the opportunity to escape. The humans walked towards Watcher to see what it was they had killed. There were two more loud bangs, and more laughter.

She was exhausted, but she needed to hunt again now if her litter was to survive. She crept out of the den to begin her task as she had done so many times before.
Their den was well concealed, but now that her kits had grown, so had their voices. They were famished, the poor things, so you could hardly blame them for mewing so loudly, but little did they realise the danger in which they put themselves. Only last week a crow had carried off the youngest: she shuddered to think about it.
She knew she would have to take her chances and seek prey at the farmyard again. If she could avoid the dog, the chicks provided easy pickings.
When she finally got to the farmyard, she was in luck. The hens were out of their pen wandering around, chicks trailing after them. It was over in a trice; a flurry of feathers was all there was to show for the missing chick’s whereabouts. She hurried back with the meagre fare, eagerly awaited by her hungry offspring. Sharp little teeth ground through soft bone and cartilage, not even the extremities of the unfortunate fowl remaining unconsumed.
As she watched, her heart grew heavy. Endangering herself to provide for them conflicted with her instinct for self-preservation and yet something kept driving her to take greater and greater risks on their behalf. The almost mutually exclusive instincts constantly warred within her, each vying for dominance. Soon, she knew she would go. All she could leave them were the names she had given them — nothing more. She wondered if the little orange kit would survive on his own, given that his coat made him so visible.
Be safe, Bushytail! she thought. Nature is a cruel taskmaster.
Bushytail was always ravenous. The volumes of lizards, mice and birds he was able to catch provided subsistence sustenance only. It also took a lot of energy for Bushytail to catch his prey, resulting in a physique that was both lean and muscular.
Daily, Bushytail faced a myriad of dangers. Larger predators such as foxes were a threat, as were other feral toms, and then there was the omnipresent danger posed by humans, many of whom, for a variety of reasons, wanted to eradicate feral cats. He had cleverly camouflaged the entrance to his den in a thicket of blackberry bushes to provide a measure of security during his brief sojourns, but it paid to be vigilant at all times.
When Bushytail was a kit, he lived with his mother and siblings, but at a young age he had had to learn the solitary behaviours he now practiced. A wild mother cat couldn’t provide for herself and her kits for very long, but at least she had given him his name, derived from her remembrance of his bushy tail.
Bushytail had only briefly lamented the loss of companion­ship his family had provided, but oftentimes, when he caught the scent of other cats, he felt lonely. When he was old enough and strong enough, he would contest other toms for territory and have a family of his own, but in the meantime, he would hunt and sleep and bide his time. With each passing day he grew wilier. He became bolder in his quest for food, drawing nearer and nearer human habitation, and reaping the rich rewards these opportunities offered.
The depth of winter was no time to travel, but soon, he would have to leave these lands and find his own territory.
Chapter One:
A New Beginning
Bushytail felt strong and confident. Spring was in the air and the privations of winter almost a memory. His belly was full and the sun warm as he stretched out his limbs. He looked around at the scrubby country that was his home. The trees were low and stunted, allowing the plants underneath to flourish. There were any number of strappy plants and ferns and the occasional grasstree. It looked more lovely to him than it had for some time, and he felt a pang of regret that he may not see it again.
It was easy to live in the moment at times like this, but Bushytail knew that it wasn’t time for rest and relaxation. All winter he had been plagued by hunger and the threat of attack from other toms and now it was time to move on. The warmer months were better for travelling, as he would be able to find food more easily on his journey and the need for shelter wasn’t as great. Besides which, he was looking forward to the adventure.
Living as an outsider in someone else’s territory was simply existence, not living. He wanted to be the master of his own domain, with a family and a clowder. Apart from the lack of space here for the growing population of feral cats, there was also the problem that this land was increasingly home to more and more humans. They were exceedingly dangerous, and he wanted to be as far away from them as possible.
Starting out, however, wasn’t as easy as it sounded. The reason no one ever left was that this territory was surrounded by obstacles: the farmland on one side, an expansive concrete river on the other, and on the third an enormous pathway for the smelly machines.
Bushytail had been considering which direction to take for days.
The concrete river seemed the least dangerous, but it was very strange. It had slippery sides that made it impossible to get a paw-grip. From time to time some unfortunates had fallen in by mistake and none had returned. The farmland was good for a daring cat, as there was easy food to be found; however, that was the direction from which all the humans seemed to come, and Bushytail was sure there would be many more of them in the lands beyond. That only left the enormous pathway for the machines, and even though just as many of his kin had died there, it seemed as if it was the only option.
There was an inviting stretch of bushland on the other side of the pathway that awaited any cat who could figure out the secret of traversing the frightening obstacle. I know I can do it! Bushytail told himself.
Cats weren’t the only creatures that had attempted crossing this pathway. There were a number of kangaroos, koalas and birds lying dead along the causeway, delighting only the crows. Granted, cats may be swift, but the fast-paced machines seemed to come out of nowhere, and any contact with them was deadly. Bushytail wasn’t sure that he wanted to risk himself by relying on his speed to cross. He thought that there must be another solution to get across the pathway, and he’d spent many weeks watching and waiting.
Recently, he had noticed some humans behaving strangely. For a reason he couldn’t comprehend, they were building some kind of structure across the deadly path. It had two tall pillars on either side, connected by a long beam with cages at intervals. Inside the cages were bright things like stars flashing. The structure wasn’t large enough for humans to use as a crossing, and he wondered why they would go to the effort of making it. He had memories of his mother warning him of the dangers humans posed, and he was taking no chances. Seeking an opportunity to examine the structure more closely, he watched and waited, keeping his distance.
After the humans left one evening, he examined the structure carefully. Unfortunately, it was built out of strange materials like the river but much more slippery. Even so, Bushytail still thought it was his best escape route, and he felt confident in his strength and agility to cross to safety.
He had dreamed of escape for weeks, convincing himself that beyond lay salvation: a land that had plentiful prey, even in winter. With an optimism granted only to youth, he imagined himself accomplishing great deeds, fighting great battles and winning great victories. He wasn’t a vain cat, but it was natural for one so young to dream of great things to come. So, with this frame of mind, he decided it was time to attempt the crossing.
Today was the day. No more delays.
Bushytail approached the gantry cautiously, sniffing, but the humans were long gone, and the strange structure gave off no scent. Although it was early morning, the noisy machines that went along the path never stopped. He was determined to try his plan of crossing using the structure the humans had made. Getting up would be easier than getting down. There was an overhanging tree on this side of the road. He climbed up and prepared to spring. The large bushy feature for which he was named swished in anticipation as he attempted to balance and take flight. He landed lightly, but slipped slightly on the cold, unyielding surface. Nevertheless, he managed to keep his footing and focused on the beam in front of him.
He was distracted by the constant thrum that came from the machines and the smell emanating from them. He needed nerves of steel, so pushed any other thoughts aside to focus on the oasis on the other side. Eyes firmly forward, he relied on his natural grace as he walked a straight line no wider than a kit’s head. Although he was a skilled climber, the surface was so unstable that each time he placed his paw, there was no margin for error at all. He didn’t let himself think about the danger if he fell, and instead did what cats did best: he lived in the now. His concentration was bent entirely on the placement of his paws, excluding all else.
He didn’t at first notice the putrid stench that began to overcome him. For some reason, an enormous rumbler, much bigger than the rest, had stopped directly beneath him. On its roof, it had a pipe that spewed forth filth. Bushytail could hardly breathe and dropped to a crouch. It was much more difficult to balance in this position, and with the miasma making him weak, he feared to move forward. Self-doubt assailed him, and he began an internal dialogue of self-beration: Why do I attempt this when all others have failed? What is wrong with where I came from anyway? Bushytail knew that his chance of reaching the other side was greatly diminished without his self-belief, and so he tried to put the negative thoughts aside.
Fortunately, the enormous machine moved away, allowing him some respite, and he was able to refocus. It will pass. Focus. You can do it, he told himself. The noise of the machines that kept moving under him, however, still assailed him. Like all cats, Bushytail was proud of his sensitive hearing, but in this situation, it was extremely difficult for him to think clearly with all the noise.
Regaining his composure, he rose and continued as quickly as prudence would allow. He once again focused only on putting one paw in front of the other until he reached the pillar on the far side. By this time, he was trembling, imagining what might have happened had fate not intervened, and he felt dizzy and nauseous from inhaling the fumes.
Although he wasn’t normally scared by heights alone, in his current condition, the view from his position added to his dizziness. He shut his eyes and focused on centring his balance on the precarious perch, making the most of the brief rest this stance afforded him.
He decided to attempt the descent by dangling his back legs off the edge and trying to wrap all four paws around the pillar to slow himself. Cats usually relied on digging their claws into the surface to climb down a tree, but that wasn’t possible given the impenetrable hardness of the pole. Gracelessly, he landed at the bottom with a thud. His heart raced with elation. I’ve done it! I’m on the other side!
He was exhausted and shaking all over. His limbs felt like jelly, and he desperately needed somewhere to rest. He had no energy to go farther. The strange structure seemed to absorb the heat of the day, and right now he found its warmth comforting. He curled himself in a ball in an indentation at the base of the pillar and fell asleep immediately.
Bushytail awoke hours later to find himself huddled against an icy mass, disoriented and alone. Shaking himself awake, he assessed his situation. He had planned to begin his journey in the glorious warmth of a spring day, enjoying the new scenery stretching before him. Of course, cats often travelled at night, having excellent night vision, but most tended to be crepuscular, that is, most active at dawn and dusk. There was no food to be had in the middle of the night and no way to see what might lie further afield to give him a sign by which he might steer. Nevertheless, Bushytail felt it was best to move away from the machines and set off, trusting to luck.
His encounter over the pathway had unsettled him more than he cared to admit. His great adventure had only just begun, and due to his lack of experience and foresight, he had nearly fallen at the first hurdle. He was flighty, jumping at the small unidentified night noises and the wind whistling in his ears. After a time, his nerves settled and he began to feel reassured by the familiar smells of the bushland, its plants and creatures. The night sky was clear and the air crisp and invigorating. The strength had returned to his muscles, and he revelled in the feel of them moving in unison to propel him.
Shortly, however, his thoughts turned to water, and he realised that he did, in fact, have a raging thirst and a sore throat, probably on account of the foul air he had inhaled. He headed downhill, reasoning that that would be his best chance of finding a water source. It wasn’t long before he could hear the familiar sounds telling him that a watercourse was indeed nearby, but being experienced in such matters, he didn’t rush in to drink without looking, knowing that water attracted all kinds of other creatures.
The moon emerged briefly from a grey coat for just long enough for him to see that he had reached a wide bend in the river, which appeared almost as a lake, surrounded by impressive rotund river gums. The moonlight shimmered on its surface invitingly and he approached carefully, using all of his senses to confirm that the coast was clear. When he was sure that there was no scent of other cats or humans nearby, he crouched and lapped the water greedily.
Sated, he moved soundlessly into the understory and surveyed the scene. As he sat there, he took in the beauty of the country in which he found himself. Beyond the watery vista towered tall mountains, reflected perfectly in the pond’s surface. The plants were all ones he knew, but the trees had become taller, shooting so far into the sky that he couldn’t see their tops. It was a big country and a big sky, and he suddenly felt very small.
He searched for somewhere safe to rest for what was left of the night. Lone toms were vulnerable when sleeping and finding a temporary place to rest for an evening was an undertaking that required careful consideration. Bushytail had unusual colouring, light fur with an orange tinge, which stood out in the mute colours of the bushland, and therefore he had to take care that he was well hidden. Thorn bushes often provided good cover, but a cat had to be careful that they weren’t already occupied.
Being extra cautious, Bushytail opted to climb a tree. This wasn’t the usual preferred sleeping place for a cat, but Bushytail had excellent balance and, as this was unknown territory, considered it the safest option. Being lean, he was able to climb up a good way and still find strong boughs to support him. Although the tree didn’t do much to provide camouflage, from experience he knew that predators rarely looked up: particularly humans.
As the tree branches gently swayed, lulling him towards sleep, he finally had a chance to reflect on his success. He had taken a huge risk today crossing the path of the noisy machines. It was the first time in his short life that he had done anything so daring. In fact, as he was a very young tom, he had really not done much yet other than avoid danger, hunt and find safe places to sleep.
He had been vaguely excited by the idea of what might be awaiting him in the vast bushland, but he hadn’t really given much thought as to what to do once he got here or what possible dangers he might face. He decided that he needed more information and made up his mind to go looking for it tomorrow. Are there cats nearby? Humans? What dangers will I encounter? He was keen to test his strength against another tom in a real fight, but he had no desire to seriously injure any cat in the process. His exhaustion eventually outweighed his curiosity, and he continued his meandering thoughts through the pathways of his dreams, the sensations only serving to heighten his desire.
He woke with a longing to start his adventure.
Chapter Two:
Well Met, Stranger
Dawn was fast approaching, heralded by the onset of the early carollers. With interest, Bushytail observed the world awakening and in particular the many birds seeking the water source. As tempting as it was to make a sudden lunge in an attempt to catch one, he held still, waiting for the right moment, only to find another cat easily as big as himself make the catch gracefully, mid-air, avoiding the treacherous slide into the river. However, Bushytail remained still, hoping to stay unseen to give him time to weigh up his options.
He then decided that attack was the best form of defence and reasoned that catching this unknown cat off-guard while he was absorbed with his prey would give Bushytail the advantage. The other cat was heading his way and would pass directly beneath him. All he had to do was wait for the right moment to strike. He planned to spring onto his opponent’s back, sharp claws digging in, and teeth latched on. He knew that it would be difficult to dislodge him from this position; the effort would be sure to tire his adversary.
Inexplicably, however, he went sailing through the air, missing his target altogether. He landed awkwardly, making an horrendous noise: his presence announced to all and sundry. To his surprise, the cat didn’t press his advantage, instead asking him a question.
‘Who are you?’ the stranger asked him.
Bushytail knew that this could just be a tactic to buy time, but he found himself responding anyway. ‘I’m an outsider. I walk alone.’
‘Stranger, I am no threat to you. Walk on by,’ came the response. There was no sense of fear or anxiety in the voice. The strange cat exuded confidence and calmness.
‘Stranger I may be, but not so green as to turn my back to you,’ replied Bushytail.
‘Then let me,’ said the stranger, and he turned and walked away.
The strange cat could have done nothing that would have surprised him more greatly. Were all the rules changed in this country that toms would simply let one another pass? How did I miss my opponent in the first place? Although he was inexperienced in fighting, he knew his reflexes were good and that his blow should have found its mark. The stranger had not even paused to retrieve the prey he had caught.
Warily, Bushytail eyed the fallen prey. He maintained his crouch for a full five minutes, using all his senses to detect the return of the hunter who had felled the prize, but eventually hunger won out and he devoured the creature rapidly. The feeling of a full belly quickly dispelled the uneasiness he had been experiencing. The sun was warm, but not too hot, and the temptation to bask was great, but he knew that while the sun was high, he needed to find a vantage point from which to get his bearings.
So, he started travelling uphill.
It wasn’t difficult terrain, but being out of his known territory, he flitted from tree to tree and the journey took much longer than it might have ordinarily. By the time he reached the summit, his muscles ached. Licking his paws, he looked out to behold the most amazing sight he had ever seen: a sea of trees as far as the eye could see. He had never imagined such an oasis existed. Surely there would be room in this vast tract of land for him. Bushytail was startled out of his wonder by a familiar voice.
‘Well met, stranger.’
He couldn’t believe his incaution. The tom must have tracked him and now came on him unawares.
‘Why have you followed me?’ demanded Bushytail.
‘Nay, stranger, I did not follow you,’ came the cryptic reply.
To his dismay, Bushytail saw that he was now surrounded by a motley-looking crew of toms. From the wide variety of markings they bore, they didn’t appear to be a clowder. It was very unusual for toms to work together, and he cursed his luck that he had stumbled upon a group that looked to have a unified purpose.
‘It seems that you have, albeit unknowingly, stumbled upon our stronghold. As you know, stray toms are often shunned by clowders, and existing as a loner can be dangerous. We decided our best chance of survival was to band together, and this rocky outcrop is the place we call home. You are in our territory now.’
‘Safety in numbers, you say? I can’t argue with that, given the position I’m in! What do you intend to do?’ Bushytail inquired.
‘That depends on you. The choice is yours: go or stay.’
Bushytail quickly considered his options. He didn’t want to give up his quest so quickly, but he needed knowledge of this new land, and perhaps this strange band of misfits could supply him with that knowledge. ‘Thank you,’ he replied, ‘as strange as your offer is, I believe I could use your help and you mine. I will stay.’
‘Well chosen,’ came the reply.
In turn, the cats introduced themselves. In the manner of their kind, all had names that referred to their physical attributes: Bristle, Claws, Squat and Brokenear. All except one, the smallest tom, who went by the name of Watcher. Although they banded together when necessary, they still preferred solitude, and each had their own den with its own entrance in the pile of rocks and brambles. The plateau provided a natural defence, as it was easy to see anyone or anything approaching. They shared hunting duties in order for someone to always maintain a watch. They even offered to hunt for Bushytail while he made a den for himself. He was glad to accept the offer and have a safe place to sleep for the night, as he had still not fully recovered from the effects of the foul air that he had inhaled on the gantry. He spent the day making a hollow indentation, well protected by rocks and thorn bushes and lined with dry grasses.
When dusk fell, the hunters returned. Birds were abundant in these highlands and there was plenty for all. Bushytail explained to his companions that the small territory from which he had come was getting smaller each day due to the arrival of more humans. They marvelled that he had passed over the noisy machines. One of the reasons they had their outpost here was that it was so close to the concrete pathway that others feared to come near.
They told him that there were two big clowders in this area: River Clowder and Tree Clowder. Last spring had been kind and many kits were born, but with the onset of winter, there were too many mouths to feed, and some of the older toms had to leave. Squat and Claws were from River Clowder, and Watcher was from Tree Clowder. Brokenear was from a place far to the east, filled with humans. Bristle was their leader, as he had arrived first and, as Bushytail had already noted, had an air of confidence that compelled others to do his bidding. Bristle didn’t say from which direction he had travelled.
As the days passed and Bushytail settled into a routine in his new life, he found that he very much enjoyed the companion­ship he was experiencing for the first time. Toms were solitary creatures, but with that also came deprivation and hardship. The mild spring weather combined with the reduced need to hunt resulted in ample leisure time, which was generally spent with his companions, and the young cats, having no responsibilities, frolicked and generally wasted their time — and relished doing so. Never before had Bushytail been carefree, and he was grateful for the humour his new companions provided.
Squat and Claws usually hunted together, as did Brokenear and Watcher, while Bristle kept watch. Brokenear, however, often complained loudly about the ineptitude of his partner, so Bushytail most often joined this pair, as much as to lend support to the little fellow as to help to equal the amount of prey brought in by the other party. During these long periods where they hunted together, Bushytail came to know his companions well.
Brokenear was continually haughty, with an overblown sense of entitlement. Bushytail got the feeling that Brokenear thought the others well beneath him. Brokenear told tales of wonder about the place he had left as a kit. There were thousands of humans, and all the surfaces were hard like the noisy machine path and the strange river. There were houses taller than trees. Brokenear was born on the streets of this place, but he said there were some cats who lived with the humans and let the humans touch them! Bushytail didn’t think that he would like to journey there.
Brokenear didn’t hide his leadership ambitions, telling Bushytail at length about how he was going to find a clowder and challenge for leadership. He plied the toms from River Clowder and Tree Clowder with questions, clearly seeking information that would help him best choose where to make a challenge.
Bushytail’s companions taught him how to hunt cooperatively; a concept with which he was wholly unfamiliar if indeed it had ever been done before in catkind history. With more than one cat hunting the same prey, one or more cats could flush out the prey and direct it into the waiting paws at the designated place. In addition, being clowderless, the toms had no kits or elderly for which to provide, resulting in an abundance of food the likes of which Bushytail had never experienced.
Despite the ease of this lifestyle, Bushytail still felt discontent. He had always imagined that nothing could be more important than a full belly. Indeed, when one was hungry, there was little consideration of anything else, but once this goal had been achieved, the soul still hungered. While he had companionship, it wasn’t the same as having family and clowder. There were no she-cats here and no kits. Nevertheless, he was in no hurry to forgo the convenience of his current situation and pushed down his feelings of unease.
In the evenings, they generally sat together, sharing the day’s hunt and exchanging stories.
Squat and Claws weren’t far from the lands where they had been born and were the least worried about their rogue status in their clowder. It was usual for young toms to go off on their own for a while when they were young and see the world. The pair were fast friends and had a carefree attitude, which made them very good company.
On the occasions when Bushytail did join the pair for hunting, the three companions had great fun with mock battles, delighting in surprising one another or putting obstacles in one another’s paths, and laughing with good humour when one of their pranks resulted in someone losing their balance. Bushytail had parted with his siblings when he was very young and revelled in the frivolity of these young companions.
True to his name, Watcher didn’t contribute overly to the evening’s conversations. He had left Tree Clowder due to his small size, which prevented him from fulfilling hunting duties as well as other cats, and he had no plans to reclaim a clowder for himself. Of all the toms in the company, he was the only member resigned to remaining an ‘outsider’.
As the others circled to converse, Watcher did indeed cut a forlorn figure, and as such, Bushytail was drawn to him. He felt a need to protect him and help him find a way to overcome his difficulties. He spent many hours at his side in silence, comforting merely with his presence. Slowly but surely, a bond grew between them, and the shy little tom looked upon Bushytail with adoring eyes whenever he appeared. Watcher took to following Bushytail around camp, trying to anticipate his needs and bringing him the best cuts of meat: all for a little kindness.
Bristle remained as much of a mystery as ever. He often sat alone at the lookout point, seemingly staring at nothing. He was always courteous but was never warm to his companions. He would give them advice about where to look for prey when the hunting was difficult, or on occasion interject in an argument when tempers became frayed, but he didn’t give much away about himself.
Nevertheless, Bushytail couldn’t help but admire Bristle’s composure. He seemed to have no need for the company or the hunting skills of his companions, as he was a masterful hunter. Indeed, Bushytail wondered why Bristle remained with the rag-tag little company. When Bushytail pressed him for answers, Bristle simply told him that he had a purpose, and he had no choice but to follow the path laid out for him. This answer, however, didn’t satisfy Bushytail at all.
Brokenear, on the other hand, was happy to answer Bushytail’s questions.
‘When do you think you will set out to find a clowder, Brokenear? Surely you are strong enough now to take on any challenger?’ Bushytail questioned.
‘There is more to being a leader than just being strong. I certainly don’t intend to be fighting constant battles to keep my leadership. If we can work together to make our life easier, surely a clowder could also? I think I can use the things we have learnt hunting together to make a clowder stronger.’
Bushytail was intrigued.
By the end of spring, Bushytail was at peak fitness. He was no longer lean, his elongated frame having been built up with muscle. The playfights with Squat and Claws, combined with the daily traversing of the high-country terrain, had ensured that his days of leisure didn’t overly impact his physical abilities in a negative way. His coat was shiny, glossy and well groomed. He felt that there was nothing he couldn’t accomplish. He took to roaming the perimeter of the camp by himself of a morning and evening, gazing at the vista, and wondering what lay beyond. Watcher would sometimes accompany him. The quiet and unobtrusive nature of his companion suited his mood, and Watcher seemed to appreciate Bushytail’s need for companionship.
At times, Bushytail found himself telling Watcher things he had never told any other cat, almost as if he was talking to himself. He told him of his siblings and his mother, and the stress of being hungry and cold. He told him of his longing to find a mate and to be part of a clowder where he would protect elders and kits. He told him of his adventures and hopes and dreams, and in doing so, perhaps began to understand himself a little better, growing in wisdom as well as stature. As time went by, it was rare for the two to be apart, the symbiotic relationship being beneficial to both parties as they gained strength and healed.
On occasions, the pair was joined by Bristle. He too seemed to take comfort in silence as they sat on the peak of the mountain with the late evening sun blanketing them with its soft diffused light and the gentle breeze blowing on their faces. Squat and Claws had told Bushytail that they found the sight of the three statues silhouetted against the sky amusing and that they had no idea what possible solace a cat found in this absurd activity. The only time Squat and Claws would stay still was to stalk prey, and then only for as long as was absolutely necessary.
Nevertheless, Bushytail valued the diversity of his companions and the different aspects of life that his experiences with them offered. They were an odd band, but he was growing fond of them all in different ways. The only one he was still not sure about was Brokenear. There was something about him that was unsettling.
It was the end of yet another day, and the disparate members of the company were enjoying the rewards of a good day’s hunting. They had eaten well and were stretching and grooming themselves as the sun set.
Unusually, it was Watcher who began the conversation this evening. ‘There’s been a strange smell on the air these past few days. It’s like the smell of the noisy machines has become stronger. Have you smelt it?’
‘Don’t be ridiculous!’ mocked Brokenear. ‘You jump at the sight of your own shadow. There are no pathways here large enough for the noisy machines. It is your imagination playing tricks on you, my worthless excuse for a hunting partner.’
Bushytail was naturally protective of his new-found friend. How dare you speak to him like that, he thought, but before he had a chance to leap to Watcher’s defence, Bristle interjected.
‘Nay, Watcher sees what is. It is true. The humans are drawing near. You would do well to heed our observant friend.’
‘I am not scared of humans,’ boasted Brokenear. ‘Many of them passed me every day when I was a kit, without even noticing me. They pose no danger.’
Squat and Claws declared that they had had no interactions with humans, and they weren’t sure who to believe about the possible threat.
‘Tree Clowder is closer to the humans than River Clowder,’ explained Watcher. ‘I know stories about humans that would make even Brokenear’s hair curl.’
‘Pah!’ Brokenear spat. ‘Why should we listen to someone as worthless as you? No one wants you. I suggest you grow a backbone.’
At this point in the conversation, Bushytail had the distinct feeling (and not for the last time) that he didn’t like Brokenear. He motioned to Watcher to leave the group, and they walked away without responding to the taunt.
Rather than dwell on it, Bushytail decided to query Watcher further about the humans.
‘How close are they?’ he asked. ‘Do you think they could come onto our territory?’
‘They can do anything they like,’ replied Watcher with sincerity. ‘They aren’t rational creatures. They don’t seek land or prey; they just rampage at will. Please, Bushytail, take my advice and steer well clear of them.’
‘I will, my friend, I promise. I will.’
By the time they made their way back to camp it was very late, and Bushytail went straight to his den. Watcher, however, sat up a while longer, standing guard not far away from where Bushytail slept.
Many hours later, when the sun began to rise, Bushytail found Watcher still at his post.
‘Have you slept? Is the danger so great that we must post a constant guard?’ Bushytail asked.
‘I slept,’ came the reply. ‘We might not need a constant guard, but we should definitely be on guard.’
They stayed close that day, but when nothing happened, they relaxed and thought that perhaps, after all, they were mistaken.
Chapter Three:
Prudence is the Greater
Part of Valour
Bushytail was in a hunting party with Squat and Claws. He was larger than many cats, but still able to move soundlessly when needed. He had become accustomed to hunting with others. Typically, Squat and Claws would flush out the prey and Bushytail would launch the attack. Food was becoming less easy to find, but today they were lucky. Two rabbits darted out, and as quick as a flash, Bushytail was after one.
Success in catching rabbits lay in the element of surprise, as cats were no match for rabbits in an open race. This one might have got away, except for the help of his companions. Being skittish creatures, the rabbits practically jumped into Bushytail’s paws when the other two cats appeared. As the cats who made the kill, it was acceptable that they ate the choice parts of the rabbits first and then took the rest back for the others. Between the three of them the meat was soon divided into manageable parts that could be carried in their mouths.
Watcher and Brokenear had also had success hunting, bringing a snake back to camp. As the weather was turning colder, the snakes were often found soaking up the sunshine on rocks.
As always when hunting had been good, spirits were high, but there was still an air of discontent in the group. Life had been easy over the summer, and they all felt safe and secure, but the main reason for a tom to grow strong was to fight and win territory. All of them clearly felt the urge to move on and find a mate. Even Watcher was looking fit and rested after the bountiful summer.
Bushytail had silently resolved to travel south in the spring. He intended to find a clowder and hopefully a mate. It was true that he was large and strong, but he had other advantages that he considered more important. There were many large, strong cats who sought to join a clowder, but he had discovered that winning respect and fostering cooperation also went a long way to ensuring success.
That night, each tom eventually made his way to his own den, curling into a tight ball against the oncoming chill of the night. It seemed the milder weather had come to an abrupt end, as sometimes happens in the high country, with no warning as to the gradual changing of the seasons.
And as abruptly as the weather changed, so did the pattern of their reasonably uneventful lives.
Bushytail shivered through the night and woke early, deciding he needed to move to warm up. As he headed to the entrance of his den, he saw the strangest sight. Everything was white, covered by ice falling from the sky. He had never seen anything like it before. Tentatively, he reached out a paw. The white powder coating everything was soft and cold to touch.
As he stepped out, he beheld with wonder the delicate patterns in the powder on his fur. He took a few nervous steps, noticing the tracks he left behind. He would have to be careful with his footing, but the white covering was not deep. With excitement and trepidation, he set out, slipping and sliding as he went, making his way slowly and carefully along the track.
The appearance of the white covering of ice reminded him how little he had seen of the world and the great many things he might yet experience. It was nice to be out in the silence walking alone once again. The surrounding whiteness gave him a sense of isolation, peacefulness and quietness, while at the same time the falling flakes that swirled around heightened his sense of excitement and expectation.
He sniffed the air. The smell of the noisy machines was very strong here.
Drawn to continue, he crawled along until he came to a clearing that was bordered by an enormous rockface on the opposite side. In the clearing sat four humans around a circle of rocks, and from the rocks sprang red tongues leaping higher with every gust of wind. The humans huddled close to the circle. They were making loud noises: talking, laughing and drinking. They seemed to have constructed some shelters nearby, and they had a noisy machine with them, although it wasn’t turned on. Bushytail had had no idea that a noisy machine could leave its pathway, and the thought filled him with fear, but he was still curious to go closer.
Watcher had warned him not to go near the humans, but Brokenear had said that they were not so bad. They certainly didn’t seem threatening; they were obviously having a good time, joking and laughing. He had observed humans from a distance before, when they were making the structure over the noisy machine pathway, but he had never dared to go close to them. In his own mind, he justified his decision to creep further forward by telling himself that he needed to know more about them firsthand instead of relying on the accounts told to him by others. Slowly, he crept from shadow to shadow, until he could smell the food they were eating.
It was exhilarating being so close. He watched them in fascination, drawing ever closer. Then he saw Watcher. He crouched undetected just outside the circle of light that emanated from the gathering. A feeling of dread crept over Bushytail again, but he firmly pushed it down. He was no coward. He resolved not to be scared just by the mere sight of humans. If Watcher could get close enough to watch them, so could he.
He could see Watcher’s eyes fixed on him, urging him to retreat.
No doubt, the little tom had been scouting in order to warn him. Bushytail felt indignant that his friend should consider him so helpless that he needed protection, and he was determined to show his bravery. Watcher again attempted to signal to Bushytail to go away, with wilder and wilder gestures.
Perhaps thinking that Bushytail hadn’t seen him, Watcher let out a wail.
Immediately, all four humans looked directly at Watcher, detecting his presence.
After that, everything happened quickly.
One of the humans picked up a stick and pointed it at Watcher. There was a loud bang and Watcher fell down. In a matter of seconds, he was silent, and a red stain began to spread from his small body, a stark contrast to the ground’s white covering. Watcher had achieved his goal: the wail had focused the attention of all four humans on Watcher, giving Bushytail the opportunity to escape. The humans walked towards Watcher to see what it was they had killed. There were two more loud bangs, and more laughter.

Prologue
She was exhausted, but she needed to hunt again now if her litter was to survive. She crept out of the den to begin her task as she had done so many times before.
Their den was well concealed, but now that her kits had grown, so had their voices. They were famished, the poor things, so you could hardly blame them for mewing so loudly, but little did they realise the danger in which they put themselves. Only last week a crow had carried off the youngest: she shuddered to think about it.
She knew she would have to take her chances and seek prey at the farmyard again. If she could avoid the dog, the chicks provided easy pickings.
When she finally got to the farmyard, she was in luck. The hens were out of their pen wandering around, chicks trailing after them. It was over in a trice; a flurry of feathers was all there was to show for the missing chick’s whereabouts. She hurried back with the meagre fare, eagerly awaited by her hungry offspring. Sharp little teeth ground through soft bone and cartilage, not even the extremities of the unfortunate fowl remaining unconsumed.
As she watched, her heart grew heavy. Endangering herself to provide for them conflicted with her instinct for self-preservation and yet something kept driving her to take greater and greater risks on their behalf. The almost mutually exclusive instincts constantly warred within her, each vying for dominance. Soon, she knew she would go. All she could leave them were the names she had given them — nothing more. She wondered if the little orange kit would survive on his own, given that his coat made him so visible.
Be safe, Bushytail! she thought. Nature is a cruel taskmaster.
Bushytail was always ravenous. The volumes of lizards, mice and birds he was able to catch provided subsistence sustenance only. It also took a lot of energy for Bushytail to catch his prey, resulting in a physique that was both lean and muscular.
Daily, Bushytail faced a myriad of dangers. Larger predators such as foxes were a threat, as were other feral toms, and then there was the omnipresent danger posed by humans, many of whom, for a variety of reasons, wanted to eradicate feral cats. He had cleverly camouflaged the entrance to his den in a thicket of blackberry bushes to provide a measure of security during his brief sojourns, but it paid to be vigilant at all times.
When Bushytail was a kit, he lived with his mother and siblings, but at a young age he had had to learn the solitary behaviours he now practiced. A wild mother cat couldn’t provide for herself and her kits for very long, but at least she had given him his name, derived from her remembrance of his bushy tail.
Bushytail had only briefly lamented the loss of companion­ship his family had provided, but oftentimes, when he caught the scent of other cats, he felt lonely. When he was old enough and strong enough, he would contest other toms for territory and have a family of his own, but in the meantime, he would hunt and sleep and bide his time. With each passing day he grew wilier. He became bolder in his quest for food, drawing nearer and nearer human habitation, and reaping the rich rewards these opportunities offered.
The depth of winter was no time to travel, but soon, he would have to leave these lands and find his own territory.
Chapter One:
A New Beginning
Bushytail felt strong and confident. Spring was in the air and the privations of winter almost a memory. His belly was full and the sun warm as he stretched out his limbs. He looked around at the scrubby country that was his home. The trees were low and stunted, allowing the plants underneath to flourish. There were any number of strappy plants and ferns and the occasional grasstree. It looked more lovely to him than it had for some time, and he felt a pang of regret that he may not see it again.
It was easy to live in the moment at times like this, but Bushytail knew that it wasn’t time for rest and relaxation. All winter he had been plagued by hunger and the threat of attack from other toms and now it was time to move on. The warmer months were better for travelling, as he would be able to find food more easily on his journey and the need for shelter wasn’t as great. Besides which, he was looking forward to the adventure.
Living as an outsider in someone else’s territory was simply existence, not living. He wanted to be the master of his own domain, with a family and a clowder. Apart from the lack of space here for the growing population of feral cats, there was also the problem that this land was increasingly home to more and more humans. They were exceedingly dangerous, and he wanted to be as far away from them as possible.
Starting out, however, wasn’t as easy as it sounded. The reason no one ever left was that this territory was surrounded by obstacles: the farmland on one side, an expansive concrete river on the other, and on the third an enormous pathway for the smelly machines.
Bushytail had been considering which direction to take for days.
The concrete river seemed the least dangerous, but it was very strange. It had slippery sides that made it impossible to get a paw-grip. From time to time some unfortunates had fallen in by mistake and none had returned. The farmland was good for a daring cat, as there was easy food to be found; however, that was the direction from which all the humans seemed to come, and Bushytail was sure there would be many more of them in the lands beyond. That only left the enormous pathway for the machines, and even though just as many of his kin had died there, it seemed as if it was the only option.
There was an inviting stretch of bushland on the other side of the pathway that awaited any cat who could figure out the secret of traversing the frightening obstacle. I know I can do it! Bushytail told himself.
Cats weren’t the only creatures that had attempted crossing this pathway. There were a number of kangaroos, koalas and birds lying dead along the causeway, delighting only the crows. Granted, cats may be swift, but the fast-paced machines seemed to come out of nowhere, and any contact with them was deadly. Bushytail wasn’t sure that he wanted to risk himself by relying on his speed to cross. He thought that there must be another solution to get across the pathway, and he’d spent many weeks watching and waiting.
Recently, he had noticed some humans behaving strangely. For a reason he couldn’t comprehend, they were building some kind of structure across the deadly path. It had two tall pillars on either side, connected by a long beam with cages at intervals. Inside the cages were bright things like stars flashing. The structure wasn’t large enough for humans to use as a crossing, and he wondered why they would go to the effort of making it. He had memories of his mother warning him of the dangers humans posed, and he was taking no chances. Seeking an opportunity to examine the structure more closely, he watched and waited, keeping his distance.
After the humans left one evening, he examined the structure carefully. Unfortunately, it was built out of strange materials like the river but much more slippery. Even so, Bushytail still thought it was his best escape route, and he felt confident in his strength and agility to cross to safety.
He had dreamed of escape for weeks, convincing himself that beyond lay salvation: a land that had plentiful prey, even in winter. With an optimism granted only to youth, he imagined himself accomplishing great deeds, fighting great battles and winning great victories. He wasn’t a vain cat, but it was natural for one so young to dream of great things to come. So, with this frame of mind, he decided it was time to attempt the crossing.
Today was the day. No more delays.
Bushytail approached the gantry cautiously, sniffing, but the humans were long gone, and the strange structure gave off no scent. Although it was early morning, the noisy machines that went along the path never stopped. He was determined to try his plan of crossing using the structure the humans had made. Getting up would be easier than getting down. There was an overhanging tree on this side of the road. He climbed up and prepared to spring. The large bushy feature for which he was named swished in anticipation as he attempted to balance and take flight. He landed lightly, but slipped slightly on the cold, unyielding surface. Nevertheless, he managed to keep his footing and focused on the beam in front of him.
He was distracted by the constant thrum that came from the machines and the smell emanating from them. He needed nerves of steel, so pushed any other thoughts aside to focus on the oasis on the other side. Eyes firmly forward, he relied on his natural grace as he walked a straight line no wider than a kit’s head. Although he was a skilled climber, the surface was so unstable that each time he placed his paw, there was no margin for error at all. He didn’t let himself think about the danger if he fell, and instead did what cats did best: he lived in the now. His concentration was bent entirely on the placement of his paws, excluding all else.
He didn’t at first notice the putrid stench that began to overcome him. For some reason, an enormous rumbler, much bigger than the rest, had stopped directly beneath him. On its roof, it had a pipe that spewed forth filth. Bushytail could hardly breathe and dropped to a crouch. It was much more difficult to balance in this position, and with the miasma making him weak, he feared to move forward. Self-doubt assailed him, and he began an internal dialogue of self-beration: Why do I attempt this when all others have failed? What is wrong with where I came from anyway? Bushytail knew that his chance of reaching the other side was greatly diminished without his self-belief, and so he tried to put the negative thoughts aside.
Fortunately, the enormous machine moved away, allowing him some respite, and he was able to refocus. It will pass. Focus. You can do it, he told himself. The noise of the machines that kept moving under him, however, still assailed him. Like all cats, Bushytail was proud of his sensitive hearing, but in this situation, it was extremely difficult for him to think clearly with all the noise.
Regaining his composure, he rose and continued as quickly as prudence would allow. He once again focused only on putting one paw in front of the other until he reached the pillar on the far side. By this time, he was trembling, imagining what might have happened had fate not intervened, and he felt dizzy and nauseous from inhaling the fumes.
Although he wasn’t normally scared by heights alone, in his current condition, the view from his position added to his dizziness. He shut his eyes and focused on centring his balance on the precarious perch, making the most of the brief rest this stance afforded him.
He decided to attempt the descent by dangling his back legs off the edge and trying to wrap all four paws around the pillar to slow himself. Cats usually relied on digging their claws into the surface to climb down a tree, but that wasn’t possible given the impenetrable hardness of the pole. Gracelessly, he landed at the bottom with a thud. His heart raced with elation. I’ve done it! I’m on the other side!
He was exhausted and shaking all over. His limbs felt like jelly, and he desperately needed somewhere to rest. He had no energy to go farther. The strange structure seemed to absorb the heat of the day, and right now he found its warmth comforting. He curled himself in a ball in an indentation at the base of the pillar and fell asleep immediately.
Bushytail awoke hours later to find himself huddled against an icy mass, disoriented and alone. Shaking himself awake, he assessed his situation. He had planned to begin his journey in the glorious warmth of a spring day, enjoying the new scenery stretching before him. Of course, cats often travelled at night, having excellent night vision, but most tended to be crepuscular, that is, most active at dawn and dusk. There was no food to be had in the middle of the night and no way to see what might lie further afield to give him a sign by which he might steer. Nevertheless, Bushytail felt it was best to move away from the machines and set off, trusting to luck.
His encounter over the pathway had unsettled him more than he cared to admit. His great adventure had only just begun, and due to his lack of experience and foresight, he had nearly fallen at the first hurdle. He was flighty, jumping at the small unidentified night noises and the wind whistling in his ears. After a time, his nerves settled and he began to feel reassured by the familiar smells of the bushland, its plants and creatures. The night sky was clear and the air crisp and invigorating. The strength had returned to his muscles, and he revelled in the feel of them moving in unison to propel him.
Shortly, however, his thoughts turned to water, and he realised that he did, in fact, have a raging thirst and a sore throat, probably on account of the foul air he had inhaled. He headed downhill, reasoning that that would be his best chance of finding a water source. It wasn’t long before he could hear the familiar sounds telling him that a watercourse was indeed nearby, but being experienced in such matters, he didn’t rush in to drink without looking, knowing that water attracted all kinds of other creatures.
The moon emerged briefly from a grey coat for just long enough for him to see that he had reached a wide bend in the river, which appeared almost as a lake, surrounded by impressive rotund river gums. The moonlight shimmered on its surface invitingly and he approached carefully, using all of his senses to confirm that the coast was clear. When he was sure that there was no scent of other cats or humans nearby, he crouched and lapped the water greedily.
Sated, he moved soundlessly into the understory and surveyed the scene. As he sat there, he took in the beauty of the country in which he found himself. Beyond the watery vista towered tall mountains, reflected perfectly in the pond’s surface. The plants were all ones he knew, but the trees had become taller, shooting so far into the sky that he couldn’t see their tops. It was a big country and a big sky, and he suddenly felt very small.
He searched for somewhere safe to rest for what was left of the night. Lone toms were vulnerable when sleeping and finding a temporary place to rest for an evening was an undertaking that required careful consideration. Bushytail had unusual colouring, light fur with an orange tinge, which stood out in the mute colours of the bushland, and therefore he had to take care that he was well hidden. Thorn bushes often provided good cover, but a cat had to be careful that they weren’t already occupied.
Being extra cautious, Bushytail opted to climb a tree. This wasn’t the usual preferred sleeping place for a cat, but Bushytail had excellent balance and, as this was unknown territory, considered it the safest option. Being lean, he was able to climb up a good way and still find strong boughs to support him. Although the tree didn’t do much to provide camouflage, from experience he knew that predators rarely looked up: particularly humans.
As the tree branches gently swayed, lulling him towards sleep, he finally had a chance to reflect on his success. He had taken a huge risk today crossing the path of the noisy machines. It was the first time in his short life that he had done anything so daring. In fact, as he was a very young tom, he had really not done much yet other than avoid danger, hunt and find safe places to sleep.
He had been vaguely excited by the idea of what might be awaiting him in the vast bushland, but he hadn’t really given much thought as to what to do once he got here or what possible dangers he might face. He decided that he needed more information and made up his mind to go looking for it tomorrow. Are there cats nearby? Humans? What dangers will I encounter? He was keen to test his strength against another tom in a real fight, but he had no desire to seriously injure any cat in the process. His exhaustion eventually outweighed his curiosity, and he continued his meandering thoughts through the pathways of his dreams, the sensations only serving to heighten his desire.
He woke with a longing to start his adventure.
Chapter Two:
Well Met, Stranger
Dawn was fast approaching, heralded by the onset of the early carollers. With interest, Bushytail observed the world awakening and in particular the many birds seeking the water source. As tempting as it was to make a sudden lunge in an attempt to catch one, he held still, waiting for the right moment, only to find another cat easily as big as himself make the catch gracefully, mid-air, avoiding the treacherous slide into the river. However, Bushytail remained still, hoping to stay unseen to give him time to weigh up his options.
He then decided that attack was the best form of defence and reasoned that catching this unknown cat off-guard while he was absorbed with his prey would give Bushytail the advantage. The other cat was heading his way and would pass directly beneath him. All he had to do was wait for the right moment to strike. He planned to spring onto his opponent’s back, sharp claws digging in, and teeth latched on. He knew that it would be difficult to dislodge him from this position; the effort would be sure to tire his adversary.
Inexplicably, however, he went sailing through the air, missing his target altogether. He landed awkwardly, making an horrendous noise: his presence announced to all and sundry. To his surprise, the cat didn’t press his advantage, instead asking him a question.
‘Who are you?’ the stranger asked him.
Bushytail knew that this could just be a tactic to buy time, but he found himself responding anyway. ‘I’m an outsider. I walk alone.’
‘Stranger, I am no threat to you. Walk on by,’ came the response. There was no sense of fear or anxiety in the voice. The strange cat exuded confidence and calmness.
‘Stranger I may be, but not so green as to turn my back to you,’ replied Bushytail.
‘Then let me,’ said the stranger, and he turned and walked away.
The strange cat could have done nothing that would have surprised him more greatly. Were all the rules changed in this country that toms would simply let one another pass? How did I miss my opponent in the first place? Although he was inexperienced in fighting, he knew his reflexes were good and that his blow should have found its mark. The stranger had not even paused to retrieve the prey he had caught.
Warily, Bushytail eyed the fallen prey. He maintained his crouch for a full five minutes, using all his senses to detect the return of the hunter who had felled the prize, but eventually hunger won out and he devoured the creature rapidly. The feeling of a full belly quickly dispelled the uneasiness he had been experiencing. The sun was warm, but not too hot, and the temptation to bask was great, but he knew that while the sun was high, he needed to find a vantage point from which to get his bearings.
So, he started travelling uphill.
It wasn’t difficult terrain, but being out of his known territory, he flitted from tree to tree and the journey took much longer than it might have ordinarily. By the time he reached the summit, his muscles ached. Licking his paws, he looked out to behold the most amazing sight he had ever seen: a sea of trees as far as the eye could see. He had never imagined such an oasis existed. Surely there would be room in this vast tract of land for him. Bushytail was startled out of his wonder by a familiar voice.
‘Well met, stranger.’
He couldn’t believe his incaution. The tom must have tracked him and now came on him unawares.
‘Why have you followed me?’ demanded Bushytail.
‘Nay, stranger, I did not follow you,’ came the cryptic reply.
To his dismay, Bushytail saw that he was now surrounded by a motley-looking crew of toms. From the wide variety of markings they bore, they didn’t appear to be a clowder. It was very unusual for toms to work together, and he cursed his luck that he had stumbled upon a group that looked to have a unified purpose.
‘It seems that you have, albeit unknowingly, stumbled upon our stronghold. As you know, stray toms are often shunned by clowders, and existing as a loner can be dangerous. We decided our best chance of survival was to band together, and this rocky outcrop is the place we call home. You are in our territory now.’
‘Safety in numbers, you say? I can’t argue with that, given the position I’m in! What do you intend to do?’ Bushytail inquired.
‘That depends on you. The choice is yours: go or stay.’
Bushytail quickly considered his options. He didn’t want to give up his quest so quickly, but he needed knowledge of this new land, and perhaps this strange band of misfits could supply him with that knowledge. ‘Thank you,’ he replied, ‘as strange as your offer is, I believe I could use your help and you mine. I will stay.’
‘Well chosen,’ came the reply.
In turn, the cats introduced themselves. In the manner of their kind, all had names that referred to their physical attributes: Bristle, Claws, Squat and Brokenear. All except one, the smallest tom, who went by the name of Watcher. Although they banded together when necessary, they still preferred solitude, and each had their own den with its own entrance in the pile of rocks and brambles. The plateau provided a natural defence, as it was easy to see anyone or anything approaching. They shared hunting duties in order for someone to always maintain a watch. They even offered to hunt for Bushytail while he made a den for himself. He was glad to accept the offer and have a safe place to sleep for the night, as he had still not fully recovered from the effects of the foul air that he had inhaled on the gantry. He spent the day making a hollow indentation, well protected by rocks and thorn bushes and lined with dry grasses.
When dusk fell, the hunters returned. Birds were abundant in these highlands and there was plenty for all. Bushytail explained to his companions that the small territory from which he had come was getting smaller each day due to the arrival of more humans. They marvelled that he had passed over the noisy machines. One of the reasons they had their outpost here was that it was so close to the concrete pathway that others feared to come near.
They told him that there were two big clowders in this area: River Clowder and Tree Clowder. Last spring had been kind and many kits were born, but with the onset of winter, there were too many mouths to feed, and some of the older toms had to leave. Squat and Claws were from River Clowder, and Watcher was from Tree Clowder. Brokenear was from a place far to the east, filled with humans. Bristle was their leader, as he had arrived first and, as Bushytail had already noted, had an air of confidence that compelled others to do his bidding. Bristle didn’t say from which direction he had travelled.
As the days passed and Bushytail settled into a routine in his new life, he found that he very much enjoyed the companion­ship he was experiencing for the first time. Toms were solitary creatures, but with that also came deprivation and hardship. The mild spring weather combined with the reduced need to hunt resulted in ample leisure time, which was generally spent with his companions, and the young cats, having no responsibilities, frolicked and generally wasted their time — and relished doing so. Never before had Bushytail been carefree, and he was grateful for the humour his new companions provided.
Squat and Claws usually hunted together, as did Brokenear and Watcher, while Bristle kept watch. Brokenear, however, often complained loudly about the ineptitude of his partner, so Bushytail most often joined this pair, as much as to lend support to the little fellow as to help to equal the amount of prey brought in by the other party. During these long periods where they hunted together, Bushytail came to know his companions well.
Brokenear was continually haughty, with an overblown sense of entitlement. Bushytail got the feeling that Brokenear thought the others well beneath him. Brokenear told tales of wonder about the place he had left as a kit. There were thousands of humans, and all the surfaces were hard like the noisy machine path and the strange river. There were houses taller than trees. Brokenear was born on the streets of this place, but he said there were some cats who lived with the humans and let the humans touch them! Bushytail didn’t think that he would like to journey there.
Brokenear didn’t hide his leadership ambitions, telling Bushytail at length about how he was going to find a clowder and challenge for leadership. He plied the toms from River Clowder and Tree Clowder with questions, clearly seeking information that would help him best choose where to make a challenge.
Bushytail’s companions taught him how to hunt cooperatively; a concept with which he was wholly unfamiliar if indeed it had ever been done before in catkind history. With more than one cat hunting the same prey, one or more cats could flush out the prey and direct it into the waiting paws at the designated place. In addition, being clowderless, the toms had no kits or elderly for which to provide, resulting in an abundance of food the likes of which Bushytail had never experienced.
Despite the ease of this lifestyle, Bushytail still felt discontent. He had always imagined that nothing could be more important than a full belly. Indeed, when one was hungry, there was little consideration of anything else, but once this goal had been achieved, the soul still hungered. While he had companionship, it wasn’t the same as having family and clowder. There were no she-cats here and no kits. Nevertheless, he was in no hurry to forgo the convenience of his current situation and pushed down his feelings of unease.
In the evenings, they generally sat together, sharing the day’s hunt and exchanging stories.
Squat and Claws weren’t far from the lands where they had been born and were the least worried about their rogue status in their clowder. It was usual for young toms to go off on their own for a while when they were young and see the world. The pair were fast friends and had a carefree attitude, which made them very good company.
On the occasions when Bushytail did join the pair for hunting, the three companions had great fun with mock battles, delighting in surprising one another or putting obstacles in one another’s paths, and laughing with good humour when one of their pranks resulted in someone losing their balance. Bushytail had parted with his siblings when he was very young and revelled in the frivolity of these young companions.
True to his name, Watcher didn’t contribute overly to the evening’s conversations. He had left Tree Clowder due to his small size, which prevented him from fulfilling hunting duties as well as other cats, and he had no plans to reclaim a clowder for himself. Of all the toms in the company, he was the only member resigned to remaining an ‘outsider’.
As the others circled to converse, Watcher did indeed cut a forlorn figure, and as such, Bushytail was drawn to him. He felt a need to protect him and help him find a way to overcome his difficulties. He spent many hours at his side in silence, comforting merely with his presence. Slowly but surely, a bond grew between them, and the shy little tom looked upon Bushytail with adoring eyes whenever he appeared. Watcher took to following Bushytail around camp, trying to anticipate his needs and bringing him the best cuts of meat: all for a little kindness.
Bristle remained as much of a mystery as ever. He often sat alone at the lookout point, seemingly staring at nothing. He was always courteous but was never warm to his companions. He would give them advice about where to look for prey when the hunting was difficult, or on occasion interject in an argument when tempers became frayed, but he didn’t give much away about himself.
Nevertheless, Bushytail couldn’t help but admire Bristle’s composure. He seemed to have no need for the company or the hunting skills of his companions, as he was a masterful hunter. Indeed, Bushytail wondered why Bristle remained with the rag-tag little company. When Bushytail pressed him for answers, Bristle simply told him that he had a purpose, and he had no choice but to follow the path laid out for him. This answer, however, didn’t satisfy Bushytail at all.
Brokenear, on the other hand, was happy to answer Bushytail’s questions.
‘When do you think you will set out to find a clowder, Brokenear? Surely you are strong enough now to take on any challenger?’ Bushytail questioned.
‘There is more to being a leader than just being strong. I certainly don’t intend to be fighting constant battles to keep my leadership. If we can work together to make our life easier, surely a clowder could also? I think I can use the things we have learnt hunting together to make a clowder stronger.’
Bushytail was intrigued.
By the end of spring, Bushytail was at peak fitness. He was no longer lean, his elongated frame having been built up with muscle. The playfights with Squat and Claws, combined with the daily traversing of the high-country terrain, had ensured that his days of leisure didn’t overly impact his physical abilities in a negative way. His coat was shiny, glossy and well groomed. He felt that there was nothing he couldn’t accomplish. He took to roaming the perimeter of the camp by himself of a morning and evening, gazing at the vista, and wondering what lay beyond. Watcher would sometimes accompany him. The quiet and unobtrusive nature of his companion suited his mood, and Watcher seemed to appreciate Bushytail’s need for companionship.
At times, Bushytail found himself telling Watcher things he had never told any other cat, almost as if he was talking to himself. He told him of his siblings and his mother, and the stress of being hungry and cold. He told him of his longing to find a mate and to be part of a clowder where he would protect elders and kits. He told him of his adventures and hopes and dreams, and in doing so, perhaps began to understand himself a little better, growing in wisdom as well as stature. As time went by, it was rare for the two to be apart, the symbiotic relationship being beneficial to both parties as they gained strength and healed.
On occasions, the pair was joined by Bristle. He too seemed to take comfort in silence as they sat on the peak of the mountain with the late evening sun blanketing them with its soft diffused light and the gentle breeze blowing on their faces. Squat and Claws had told Bushytail that they found the sight of the three statues silhouetted against the sky amusing and that they had no idea what possible solace a cat found in this absurd activity. The only time Squat and Claws would stay still was to stalk prey, and then only for as long as was absolutely necessary.
Nevertheless, Bushytail valued the diversity of his companions and the different aspects of life that his experiences with them offered. They were an odd band, but he was growing fond of them all in different ways. The only one he was still not sure about was Brokenear. There was something about him that was unsettling.
It was the end of yet another day, and the disparate members of the company were enjoying the rewards of a good day’s hunting. They had eaten well and were stretching and grooming themselves as the sun set.
Unusually, it was Watcher who began the conversation this evening. ‘There’s been a strange smell on the air these past few days. It’s like the smell of the noisy machines has become stronger. Have you smelt it?’
‘Don’t be ridiculous!’ mocked Brokenear. ‘You jump at the sight of your own shadow. There are no pathways here large enough for the noisy machines. It is your imagination playing tricks on you, my worthless excuse for a hunting partner.’
Bushytail was naturally protective of his new-found friend. How dare you speak to him like that, he thought, but before he had a chance to leap to Watcher’s defence, Bristle interjected.
‘Nay, Watcher sees what is. It is true. The humans are drawing near. You would do well to heed our observant friend.’
‘I am not scared of humans,’ boasted Brokenear. ‘Many of them passed me every day when I was a kit, without even noticing me. They pose no danger.’
Squat and Claws declared that they had had no interactions with humans, and they weren’t sure who to believe about the possible threat.
‘Tree Clowder is closer to the humans than River Clowder,’ explained Watcher. ‘I know stories about humans that would make even Brokenear’s hair curl.’
‘Pah!’ Brokenear spat. ‘Why should we listen to someone as worthless as you? No one wants you. I suggest you grow a backbone.’
At this point in the conversation, Bushytail had the distinct feeling (and not for the last time) that he didn’t like Brokenear. He motioned to Watcher to leave the group, and they walked away without responding to the taunt.
Rather than dwell on it, Bushytail decided to query Watcher further about the humans.
‘How close are they?’ he asked. ‘Do you think they could come onto our territory?’
‘They can do anything they like,’ replied Watcher with sincerity. ‘They aren’t rational creatures. They don’t seek land or prey; they just rampage at will. Please, Bushytail, take my advice and steer well clear of them.’
‘I will, my friend, I promise. I will.’
By the time they made their way back to camp it was very late, and Bushytail went straight to his den. Watcher, however, sat up a while longer, standing guard not far away from where Bushytail slept.
Many hours later, when the sun began to rise, Bushytail found Watcher still at his post.
‘Have you slept? Is the danger so great that we must post a constant guard?’ Bushytail asked.
‘I slept,’ came the reply. ‘We might not need a constant guard, but we should definitely be on guard.’
They stayed close that day, but when nothing happened, they relaxed and thought that perhaps, after all, they were mistaken.
Chapter Three:
Prudence is the Greater
Part of Valour
Bushytail was in a hunting party with Squat and Claws. He was larger than many cats, but still able to move soundlessly when needed. He had become accustomed to hunting with others. Typically, Squat and Claws would flush out the prey and Bushytail would launch the attack. Food was becoming less easy to find, but today they were lucky. Two rabbits darted out, and as quick as a flash, Bushytail was after one.
Success in catching rabbits lay in the element of surprise, as cats were no match for rabbits in an open race. This one might have got away, except for the help of his companions. Being skittish creatures, the rabbits practically jumped into Bushytail’s paws when the other two cats appeared. As the cats who made the kill, it was acceptable that they ate the choice parts of the rabbits first and then took the rest back for the others. Between the three of them the meat was soon divided into manageable parts that could be carried in their mouths.
Watcher and Brokenear had also had success hunting, bringing a snake back to camp. As the weather was turning colder, the snakes were often found soaking up the sunshine on rocks.
As always when hunting had been good, spirits were high, but there was still an air of discontent in the group. Life had been easy over the summer, and they all felt safe and secure, but the main reason for a tom to grow strong was to fight and win territory. All of them clearly felt the urge to move on and find a mate. Even Watcher was looking fit and rested after the bountiful summer.
Bushytail had silently resolved to travel south in the spring. He intended to find a clowder and hopefully a mate. It was true that he was large and strong, but he had other advantages that he considered more important. There were many large, strong cats who sought to join a clowder, but he had discovered that winning respect and fostering cooperation also went a long way to ensuring success.
That night, each tom eventually made his way to his own den, curling into a tight ball against the oncoming chill of the night. It seemed the milder weather had come to an abrupt end, as sometimes happens in the high country, with no warning as to the gradual changing of the seasons.
And as abruptly as the weather changed, so did the pattern of their reasonably uneventful lives.
Bushytail shivered through the night and woke early, deciding he needed to move to warm up. As he headed to the entrance of his den, he saw the strangest sight. Everything was white, covered by ice falling from the sky. He had never seen anything like it before. Tentatively, he reached out a paw. The white powder coating everything was soft and cold to touch.
As he stepped out, he beheld with wonder the delicate patterns in the powder on his fur. He took a few nervous steps, noticing the tracks he left behind. He would have to be careful with his footing, but the white covering was not deep. With excitement and trepidation, he set out, slipping and sliding as he went, making his way slowly and carefully along the track.
The appearance of the white covering of ice reminded him how little he had seen of the world and the great many things he might yet experience. It was nice to be out in the silence walking alone once again. The surrounding whiteness gave him a sense of isolation, peacefulness and quietness, while at the same time the falling flakes that swirled around heightened his sense of excitement and expectation.
He sniffed the air. The smell of the noisy machines was very strong here.
Drawn to continue, he crawled along until he came to a clearing that was bordered by an enormous rockface on the opposite side. In the clearing sat four humans around a circle of rocks, and from the rocks sprang red tongues leaping higher with every gust of wind. The humans huddled close to the circle. They were making loud noises: talking, laughing and drinking. They seemed to have constructed some shelters nearby, and they had a noisy machine with them, although it wasn’t turned on. Bushytail had had no idea that a noisy machine could leave its pathway, and the thought filled him with fear, but he was still curious to go closer.
Watcher had warned him not to go near the humans, but Brokenear had said that they were not so bad. They certainly didn’t seem threatening; they were obviously having a good time, joking and laughing. He had observed humans from a distance before, when they were making the structure over the noisy machine pathway, but he had never dared to go close to them. In his own mind, he justified his decision to creep further forward by telling himself that he needed to know more about them firsthand instead of relying on the accounts told to him by others. Slowly, he crept from shadow to shadow, until he could smell the food they were eating.
It was exhilarating being so close. He watched them in fascination, drawing ever closer. Then he saw Watcher. He crouched undetected just outside the circle of light that emanated from the gathering. A feeling of dread crept over Bushytail again, but he firmly pushed it down. He was no coward. He resolved not to be scared just by the mere sight of humans. If Watcher could get close enough to watch them, so could he.
He could see Watcher’s eyes fixed on him, urging him to retreat.
No doubt, the little tom had been scouting in order to warn him. Bushytail felt indignant that his friend should consider him so helpless that he needed protection, and he was determined to show his bravery. Watcher again attempted to signal to Bushytail to go away, with wilder and wilder gestures.
Perhaps thinking that Bushytail hadn’t seen him, Watcher let out a wail.
Immediately, all four humans looked directly at Watcher, detecting his presence.
After that, everything happened quickly.
One of the humans picked up a stick and pointed it at Watcher. There was a loud bang and Watcher fell down. In a matter of seconds, he was silent, and a red stain began to spread from his small body, a stark contrast to the ground’s white covering. Watcher had achieved his goal: the wail had focused the attention of all four humans on Watcher, giving Bushytail the opportunity to escape. The humans walked towards Watcher to see what it was they had killed. There were two more loud bangs, and more laughter.

Prologue
She was exhausted, but she needed to hunt again now if her litter was to survive. She crept out of the den to begin her task as she had done so many times before.
Their den was well concealed, but now that her kits had grown, so had their voices. They were famished, the poor things, so you could hardly blame them for mewing so loudly, but little did they realise the danger in which they put themselves. Only last week a crow had carried off the youngest: she shuddered to think about it.
She knew she would have to take her chances and seek prey at the farmyard again. If she could avoid the dog, the chicks provided easy pickings.
When she finally got to the farmyard, she was in luck. The hens were out of their pen wandering around, chicks trailing after them. It was over in a trice; a flurry of feathers was all there was to show for the missing chick’s whereabouts. She hurried back with the meagre fare, eagerly awaited by her hungry offspring. Sharp little teeth ground through soft bone and cartilage, not even the extremities of the unfortunate fowl remaining unconsumed.
As she watched, her heart grew heavy. Endangering herself to provide for them conflicted with her instinct for self-preservation and yet something kept driving her to take greater and greater risks on their behalf. The almost mutually exclusive instincts constantly warred within her, each vying for dominance. Soon, she knew she would go. All she could leave them were the names she had given them — nothing more. She wondered if the little orange kit would survive on his own, given that his coat made him so visible.
Be safe, Bushytail! she thought. Nature is a cruel taskmaster.
Bushytail was always ravenous. The volumes of lizards, mice and birds he was able to catch provided subsistence sustenance only. It also took a lot of energy for Bushytail to catch his prey, resulting in a physique that was both lean and muscular.
Daily, Bushytail faced a myriad of dangers. Larger predators such as foxes were a threat, as were other feral toms, and then there was the omnipresent danger posed by humans, many of whom, for a variety of reasons, wanted to eradicate feral cats. He had cleverly camouflaged the entrance to his den in a thicket of blackberry bushes to provide a measure of security during his brief sojourns, but it paid to be vigilant at all times.
When Bushytail was a kit, he lived with his mother and siblings, but at a young age he had had to learn the solitary behaviours he now practiced. A wild mother cat couldn’t provide for herself and her kits for very long, but at least she had given him his name, derived from her remembrance of his bushy tail.
Bushytail had only briefly lamented the loss of companion­ship his family had provided, but oftentimes, when he caught the scent of other cats, he felt lonely. When he was old enough and strong enough, he would contest other toms for territory and have a family of his own, but in the meantime, he would hunt and sleep and bide his time. With each passing day he grew wilier. He became bolder in his quest for food, drawing nearer and nearer human habitation, and reaping the rich rewards these opportunities offered.
The depth of winter was no time to travel, but soon, he would have to leave these lands and find his own territory.
Chapter One:
A New Beginning
Bushytail felt strong and confident. Spring was in the air and the privations of winter almost a memory. His belly was full and the sun warm as he stretched out his limbs. He looked around at the scrubby country that was his home. The trees were low and stunted, allowing the plants underneath to flourish. There were any number of strappy plants and ferns and the occasional grasstree. It looked more lovely to him than it had for some time, and he felt a pang of regret that he may not see it again.
It was easy to live in the moment at times like this, but Bushytail knew that it wasn’t time for rest and relaxation. All winter he had been plagued by hunger and the threat of attack from other toms and now it was time to move on. The warmer months were better for travelling, as he would be able to find food more easily on his journey and the need for shelter wasn’t as great. Besides which, he was looking forward to the adventure.
Living as an outsider in someone else’s territory was simply existence, not living. He wanted to be the master of his own domain, with a family and a clowder. Apart from the lack of space here for the growing population of feral cats, there was also the problem that this land was increasingly home to more and more humans. They were exceedingly dangerous, and he wanted to be as far away from them as possible.
Starting out, however, wasn’t as easy as it sounded. The reason no one ever left was that this territory was surrounded by obstacles: the farmland on one side, an expansive concrete river on the other, and on the third an enormous pathway for the smelly machines.
Bushytail had been considering which direction to take for days.
The concrete river seemed the least dangerous, but it was very strange. It had slippery sides that made it impossible to get a paw-grip. From time to time some unfortunates had fallen in by mistake and none had returned. The farmland was good for a daring cat, as there was easy food to be found; however, that was the direction from which all the humans seemed to come, and Bushytail was sure there would be many more of them in the lands beyond. That only left the enormous pathway for the machines, and even though just as many of his kin had died there, it seemed as if it was the only option.
There was an inviting stretch of bushland on the other side of the pathway that awaited any cat who could figure out the secret of traversing the frightening obstacle. I know I can do it! Bushytail told himself.
Cats weren’t the only creatures that had attempted crossing this pathway. There were a number of kangaroos, koalas and birds lying dead along the causeway, delighting only the crows. Granted, cats may be swift, but the fast-paced machines seemed to come out of nowhere, and any contact with them was deadly. Bushytail wasn’t sure that he wanted to risk himself by relying on his speed to cross. He thought that there must be another solution to get across the pathway, and he’d spent many weeks watching and waiting.
Recently, he had noticed some humans behaving strangely. For a reason he couldn’t comprehend, they were building some kind of structure across the deadly path. It had two tall pillars on either side, connected by a long beam with cages at intervals. Inside the cages were bright things like stars flashing. The structure wasn’t large enough for humans to use as a crossing, and he wondered why they would go to the effort of making it. He had memories of his mother warning him of the dangers humans posed, and he was taking no chances. Seeking an opportunity to examine the structure more closely, he watched and waited, keeping his distance.
After the humans left one evening, he examined the structure carefully. Unfortunately, it was built out of strange materials like the river but much more slippery. Even so, Bushytail still thought it was his best escape route, and he felt confident in his strength and agility to cross to safety.
He had dreamed of escape for weeks, convincing himself that beyond lay salvation: a land that had plentiful prey, even in winter. With an optimism granted only to youth, he imagined himself accomplishing great deeds, fighting great battles and winning great victories. He wasn’t a vain cat, but it was natural for one so young to dream of great things to come. So, with this frame of mind, he decided it was time to attempt the crossing.
Today was the day. No more delays.
Bushytail approached the gantry cautiously, sniffing, but the humans were long gone, and the strange structure gave off no scent. Although it was early morning, the noisy machines that went along the path never stopped. He was determined to try his plan of crossing using the structure the humans had made. Getting up would be easier than getting down. There was an overhanging tree on this side of the road. He climbed up and prepared to spring. The large bushy feature for which he was named swished in anticipation as he attempted to balance and take flight. He landed lightly, but slipped slightly on the cold, unyielding surface. Nevertheless, he managed to keep his footing and focused on the beam in front of him.
He was distracted by the constant thrum that came from the machines and the smell emanating from them. He needed nerves of steel, so pushed any other thoughts aside to focus on the oasis on the other side. Eyes firmly forward, he relied on his natural grace as he walked a straight line no wider than a kit’s head. Although he was a skilled climber, the surface was so unstable that each time he placed his paw, there was no margin for error at all. He didn’t let himself think about the danger if he fell, and instead did what cats did best: he lived in the now. His concentration was bent entirely on the placement of his paws, excluding all else.
He didn’t at first notice the putrid stench that began to overcome him. For some reason, an enormous rumbler, much bigger than the rest, had stopped directly beneath him. On its roof, it had a pipe that spewed forth filth. Bushytail could hardly breathe and dropped to a crouch. It was much more difficult to balance in this position, and with the miasma making him weak, he feared to move forward. Self-doubt assailed him, and he began an internal dialogue of self-beration: Why do I attempt this when all others have failed? What is wrong with where I came from anyway? Bushytail knew that his chance of reaching the other side was greatly diminished without his self-belief, and so he tried to put the negative thoughts aside.
Fortunately, the enormous machine moved away, allowing him some respite, and he was able to refocus. It will pass. Focus. You can do it, he told himself. The noise of the machines that kept moving under him, however, still assailed him. Like all cats, Bushytail was proud of his sensitive hearing, but in this situation, it was extremely difficult for him to think clearly with all the noise.
Regaining his composure, he rose and continued as quickly as prudence would allow. He once again focused only on putting one paw in front of the other until he reached the pillar on the far side. By this time, he was trembling, imagining what might have happened had fate not intervened, and he felt dizzy and nauseous from inhaling the fumes.
Although he wasn’t normally scared by heights alone, in his current condition, the view from his position added to his dizziness. He shut his eyes and focused on centring his balance on the precarious perch, making the most of the brief rest this stance afforded him.
He decided to attempt the descent by dangling his back legs off the edge and trying to wrap all four paws around the pillar to slow himself. Cats usually relied on digging their claws into the surface to climb down a tree, but that wasn’t possible given the impenetrable hardness of the pole. Gracelessly, he landed at the bottom with a thud. His heart raced with elation. I’ve done it! I’m on the other side!
He was exhausted and shaking all over. His limbs felt like jelly, and he desperately needed somewhere to rest. He had no energy to go farther. The strange structure seemed to absorb the heat of the day, and right now he found its warmth comforting. He curled himself in a ball in an indentation at the base of the pillar and fell asleep immediately.
Bushytail awoke hours later to find himself huddled against an icy mass, disoriented and alone. Shaking himself awake, he assessed his situation. He had planned to begin his journey in the glorious warmth of a spring day, enjoying the new scenery stretching before him. Of course, cats often travelled at night, having excellent night vision, but most tended to be crepuscular, that is, most active at dawn and dusk. There was no food to be had in the middle of the night and no way to see what might lie further afield to give him a sign by which he might steer. Nevertheless, Bushytail felt it was best to move away from the machines and set off, trusting to luck.
His encounter over the pathway had unsettled him more than he cared to admit. His great adventure had only just begun, and due to his lack of experience and foresight, he had nearly fallen at the first hurdle. He was flighty, jumping at the small unidentified night noises and the wind whistling in his ears. After a time, his nerves settled and he began to feel reassured by the familiar smells of the bushland, its plants and creatures. The night sky was clear and the air crisp and invigorating. The strength had returned to his muscles, and he revelled in the feel of them moving in unison to propel him.
Shortly, however, his thoughts turned to water, and he realised that he did, in fact, have a raging thirst and a sore throat, probably on account of the foul air he had inhaled. He headed downhill, reasoning that that would be his best chance of finding a water source. It wasn’t long before he could hear the familiar sounds telling him that a watercourse was indeed nearby, but being experienced in such matters, he didn’t rush in to drink without looking, knowing that water attracted all kinds of other creatures.
The moon emerged briefly from a grey coat for just long enough for him to see that he had reached a wide bend in the river, which appeared almost as a lake, surrounded by impressive rotund river gums. The moonlight shimmered on its surface invitingly and he approached carefully, using all of his senses to confirm that the coast was clear. When he was sure that there was no scent of other cats or humans nearby, he crouched and lapped the water greedily.
Sated, he moved soundlessly into the understory and surveyed the scene. As he sat there, he took in the beauty of the country in which he found himself. Beyond the watery vista towered tall mountains, reflected perfectly in the pond’s surface. The plants were all ones he knew, but the trees had become taller, shooting so far into the sky that he couldn’t see their tops. It was a big country and a big sky, and he suddenly felt very small.
He searched for somewhere safe to rest for what was left of the night. Lone toms were vulnerable when sleeping and finding a temporary place to rest for an evening was an undertaking that required careful consideration. Bushytail had unusual colouring, light fur with an orange tinge, which stood out in the mute colours of the bushland, and therefore he had to take care that he was well hidden. Thorn bushes often provided good cover, but a cat had to be careful that they weren’t already occupied.
Being extra cautious, Bushytail opted to climb a tree. This wasn’t the usual preferred sleeping place for a cat, but Bushytail had excellent balance and, as this was unknown territory, considered it the safest option. Being lean, he was able to climb up a good way and still find strong boughs to support him. Although the tree didn’t do much to provide camouflage, from experience he knew that predators rarely looked up: particularly humans.
As the tree branches gently swayed, lulling him towards sleep, he finally had a chance to reflect on his success. He had taken a huge risk today crossing the path of the noisy machines. It was the first time in his short life that he had done anything so daring. In fact, as he was a very young tom, he had really not done much yet other than avoid danger, hunt and find safe places to sleep.
He had been vaguely excited by the idea of what might be awaiting him in the vast bushland, but he hadn’t really given much thought as to what to do once he got here or what possible dangers he might face. He decided that he needed more information and made up his mind to go looking for it tomorrow. Are there cats nearby? Humans? What dangers will I encounter? He was keen to test his strength against another tom in a real fight, but he had no desire to seriously injure any cat in the process. His exhaustion eventually outweighed his curiosity, and he continued his meandering thoughts through the pathways of his dreams, the sensations only serving to heighten his desire.
He woke with a longing to start his adventure.

Dawn was fast approaching, heralded by the onset of the early carollers. With interest, Bushytail observed the world awakening and in particular the many birds seeking the water source. As tempting as it was to make a sudden lunge in an attempt to catch one, he held still, waiting for the right moment, only to find another cat easily as big as himself make the catch gracefully, mid-air, avoiding the treacherous slide into the river. However, Bushytail remained still, hoping to stay unseen to give him time to weigh up his options.
He then decided that attack was the best form of defence and reasoned that catching this unknown cat off-guard while he was absorbed with his prey would give Bushytail the advantage. The other cat was heading his way and would pass directly beneath him. All he had to do was wait for the right moment to strike. He planned to spring onto his opponent’s back, sharp claws digging in, and teeth latched on. He knew that it would be difficult to dislodge him from this position; the effort would be sure to tire his adversary.
Inexplicably, however, he went sailing through the air, missing his target altogether. He landed awkwardly, making an horrendous noise: his presence announced to all and sundry. To his surprise, the cat didn’t press his advantage, instead asking him a question.
‘Who are you?’ the stranger asked him.
Bushytail knew that this could just be a tactic to buy time, but he found himself responding anyway. ‘I’m an outsider. I walk alone.’
‘Stranger, I am no threat to you. Walk on by,’ came the response. There was no sense of fear or anxiety in the voice. The strange cat exuded confidence and calmness.
‘Stranger I may be, but not so green as to turn my back to you,’ replied Bushytail.
‘Then let me,’ said the stranger, and he turned and walked away.
The strange cat could have done nothing that would have surprised him more greatly. Were all the rules changed in this country that toms would simply let one another pass? How did I miss my opponent in the first place? Although he was inexperienced in fighting, he knew his reflexes were good and that his blow should have found its mark. The stranger had not even paused to retrieve the prey he had caught.
Warily, Bushytail eyed the fallen prey. He maintained his crouch for a full five minutes, using all his senses to detect the return of the hunter who had felled the prize, but eventually hunger won out and he devoured the creature rapidly. The feeling of a full belly quickly dispelled the uneasiness he had been experiencing. The sun was warm, but not too hot, and the temptation to bask was great, but he knew that while the sun was high, he needed to find a vantage point from which to get his bearings.
So, he started travelling uphill.
It wasn’t difficult terrain, but being out of his known territory, he flitted from tree to tree and the journey took much longer than it might have ordinarily. By the time he reached the summit, his muscles ached. Licking his paws, he looked out to behold the most amazing sight he had ever seen: a sea of trees as far as the eye could see. He had never imagined such an oasis existed. Surely there would be room in this vast tract of land for him. Bushytail was startled out of his wonder by a familiar voice.
‘Well met, stranger.’
He couldn’t believe his incaution. The tom must have tracked him and now came on him unawares.
‘Why have you followed me?’ demanded Bushytail.
‘Nay, stranger, I did not follow you,’ came the cryptic reply.
To his dismay, Bushytail saw that he was now surrounded by a motley-looking crew of toms. From the wide variety of markings they bore, they didn’t appear to be a clowder. It was very unusual for toms to work together, and he cursed his luck that he had stumbled upon a group that looked to have a unified purpose.
‘It seems that you have, albeit unknowingly, stumbled upon our stronghold. As you know, stray toms are often shunned by clowders, and existing as a loner can be dangerous. We decided our best chance of survival was to band together, and this rocky outcrop is the place we call home. You are in our territory now.’
‘Safety in numbers, you say? I can’t argue with that, given the position I’m in! What do you intend to do?’ Bushytail inquired.
‘That depends on you. The choice is yours: go or stay.’
Bushytail quickly considered his options. He didn’t want to give up his quest so quickly, but he needed knowledge of this new land, and perhaps this strange band of misfits could supply him with that knowledge. ‘Thank you,’ he replied, ‘as strange as your offer is, I believe I could use your help and you mine. I will stay.’
‘Well chosen,’ came the reply.
In turn, the cats introduced themselves. In the manner of their kind, all had names that referred to their physical attributes: Bristle, Claws, Squat and Brokenear. All except one, the smallest tom, who went by the name of Watcher. Although they banded together when necessary, they still preferred solitude, and each had their own den with its own entrance in the pile of rocks and brambles. The plateau provided a natural defence, as it was easy to see anyone or anything approaching. They shared hunting duties in order for someone to always maintain a watch. They even offered to hunt for Bushytail while he made a den for himself. He was glad to accept the offer and have a safe place to sleep for the night, as he had still not fully recovered from the effects of the foul air that he had inhaled on the gantry. He spent the day making a hollow indentation, well protected by rocks and thorn bushes and lined with dry grasses.
When dusk fell, the hunters returned. Birds were abundant in these highlands and there was plenty for all. Bushytail explained to his companions that the small territory from which he had come was getting smaller each day due to the arrival of more humans. They marvelled that he had passed over the noisy machines. One of the reasons they had their outpost here was that it was so close to the concrete pathway that others feared to come near.
They told him that there were two big clowders in this area: River Clowder and Tree Clowder. Last spring had been kind and many kits were born, but with the onset of winter, there were too many mouths to feed, and some of the older toms had to leave. Squat and Claws were from River Clowder, and Watcher was from Tree Clowder. Brokenear was from a place far to the east, filled with humans. Bristle was their leader, as he had arrived first and, as Bushytail had already noted, had an air of confidence that compelled others to do his bidding. Bristle didn’t say from which direction he had travelled.
As the days passed and Bushytail settled into a routine in his new life, he found that he very much enjoyed the companion­ship he was experiencing for the first time. Toms were solitary creatures, but with that also came deprivation and hardship. The mild spring weather combined with the reduced need to hunt resulted in ample leisure time, which was generally spent with his companions, and the young cats, having no responsibilities, frolicked and generally wasted their time — and relished doing so. Never before had Bushytail been carefree, and he was grateful for the humour his new companions provided.
Squat and Claws usually hunted together, as did Brokenear and Watcher, while Bristle kept watch. Brokenear, however, often complained loudly about the ineptitude of his partner, so Bushytail most often joined this pair, as much as to lend support to the little fellow as to help to equal the amount of prey brought in by the other party. During these long periods where they hunted together, Bushytail came to know his companions well.
Brokenear was continually haughty, with an overblown sense of entitlement. Bushytail got the feeling that Brokenear thought the others well beneath him. Brokenear told tales of wonder about the place he had left as a kit. There were thousands of humans, and all the surfaces were hard like the noisy machine path and the strange river. There were houses taller than trees. Brokenear was born on the streets of this place, but he said there were some cats who lived with the humans and let the humans touch them! Bushytail didn’t think that he would like to journey there.
Brokenear didn’t hide his leadership ambitions, telling Bushytail at length about how he was going to find a clowder and challenge for leadership. He plied the toms from River Clowder and Tree Clowder with questions, clearly seeking information that would help him best choose where to make a challenge.
Bushytail’s companions taught him how to hunt cooperatively; a concept with which he was wholly unfamiliar if indeed it had ever been done before in catkind history. With more than one cat hunting the same prey, one or more cats could flush out the prey and direct it into the waiting paws at the designated place. In addition, being clowderless, the toms had no kits or elderly for which to provide, resulting in an abundance of food the likes of which Bushytail had never experienced.
Despite the ease of this lifestyle, Bushytail still felt discontent. He had always imagined that nothing could be more important than a full belly. Indeed, when one was hungry, there was little consideration of anything else, but once this goal had been achieved, the soul still hungered. While he had companionship, it wasn’t the same as having family and clowder. There were no she-cats here and no kits. Nevertheless, he was in no hurry to forgo the convenience of his current situation and pushed down his feelings of unease.
In the evenings, they generally sat together, sharing the day’s hunt and exchanging stories.
Squat and Claws weren’t far from the lands where they had been born and were the least worried about their rogue status in their clowder. It was usual for young toms to go off on their own for a while when they were young and see the world. The pair were fast friends and had a carefree attitude, which made them very good company.
On the occasions when Bushytail did join the pair for hunting, the three companions had great fun with mock battles, delighting in surprising one another or putting obstacles in one another’s paths, and laughing with good humour when one of their pranks resulted in someone losing their balance. Bushytail had parted with his siblings when he was very young and revelled in the frivolity of these young companions.
True to his name, Watcher didn’t contribute overly to the evening’s conversations. He had left Tree Clowder due to his small size, which prevented him from fulfilling hunting duties as well as other cats, and he had no plans to reclaim a clowder for himself. Of all the toms in the company, he was the only member resigned to remaining an ‘outsider’.
As the others circled to converse, Watcher did indeed cut a forlorn figure, and as such, Bushytail was drawn to him. He felt a need to protect him and help him find a way to overcome his difficulties. He spent many hours at his side in silence, comforting merely with his presence. Slowly but surely, a bond grew between them, and the shy little tom looked upon Bushytail with adoring eyes whenever he appeared. Watcher took to following Bushytail around camp, trying to anticipate his needs and bringing him the best cuts of meat: all for a little kindness.
Bristle remained as much of a mystery as ever. He often sat alone at the lookout point, seemingly staring at nothing. He was always courteous but was never warm to his companions. He would give them advice about where to look for prey when the hunting was difficult, or on occasion interject in an argument when tempers became frayed, but he didn’t give much away about himself.
Nevertheless, Bushytail couldn’t help but admire Bristle’s composure. He seemed to have no need for the company or the hunting skills of his companions, as he was a masterful hunter. Indeed, Bushytail wondered why Bristle remained with the rag-tag little company. When Bushytail pressed him for answers, Bristle simply told him that he had a purpose, and he had no choice but to follow the path laid out for him. This answer, however, didn’t satisfy Bushytail at all.
Brokenear, on the other hand, was happy to answer Bushytail’s questions.
‘When do you think you will set out to find a clowder, Brokenear? Surely you are strong enough now to take on any challenger?’ Bushytail questioned.
‘There is more to being a leader than just being strong. I certainly don’t intend to be fighting constant battles to keep my leadership. If we can work together to make our life easier, surely a clowder could also? I think I can use the things we have learnt hunting together to make a clowder stronger.’
Bushytail was intrigued.
By the end of spring, Bushytail was at peak fitness. He was no longer lean, his elongated frame having been built up with muscle. The playfights with Squat and Claws, combined with the daily traversing of the high-country terrain, had ensured that his days of leisure didn’t overly impact his physical abilities in a negative way. His coat was shiny, glossy and well groomed. He felt that there was nothing he couldn’t accomplish. He took to roaming the perimeter of the camp by himself of a morning and evening, gazing at the vista, and wondering what lay beyond. Watcher would sometimes accompany him. The quiet and unobtrusive nature of his companion suited his mood, and Watcher seemed to appreciate Bushytail’s need for companionship.
At times, Bushytail found himself telling Watcher things he had never told any other cat, almost as if he was talking to himself. He told him of his siblings and his mother, and the stress of being hungry and cold. He told him of his longing to find a mate and to be part of a clowder where he would protect elders and kits. He told him of his adventures and hopes and dreams, and in doing so, perhaps began to understand himself a little better, growing in wisdom as well as stature. As time went by, it was rare for the two to be apart, the symbiotic relationship being beneficial to both parties as they gained strength and healed.
On occasions, the pair was joined by Bristle. He too seemed to take comfort in silence as they sat on the peak of the mountain with the late evening sun blanketing them with its soft diffused light and the gentle breeze blowing on their faces. Squat and Claws had told Bushytail that they found the sight of the three statues silhouetted against the sky amusing and that they had no idea what possible solace a cat found in this absurd activity. The only time Squat and Claws would stay still was to stalk prey, and then only for as long as was absolutely necessary.
Nevertheless, Bushytail valued the diversity of his companions and the different aspects of life that his experiences with them offered. They were an odd band, but he was growing fond of them all in different ways. The only one he was still not sure about was Brokenear. There was something about him that was unsettling.
It was the end of yet another day, and the disparate members of the company were enjoying the rewards of a good day’s hunting. They had eaten well and were stretching and grooming themselves as the sun set.
Unusually, it was Watcher who began the conversation this evening. ‘There’s been a strange smell on the air these past few days. It’s like the smell of the noisy machines has become stronger. Have you smelt it?’
‘Don’t be ridiculous!’ mocked Brokenear. ‘You jump at the sight of your own shadow. There are no pathways here large enough for the noisy machines. It is your imagination playing tricks on you, my worthless excuse for a hunting partner.’
Bushytail was naturally protective of his new-found friend. How dare you speak to him like that, he thought, but before he had a chance to leap to Watcher’s defence, Bristle interjected.
‘Nay, Watcher sees what is. It is true. The humans are drawing near. You would do well to heed our observant friend.’
‘I am not scared of humans,’ boasted Brokenear. ‘Many of them passed me every day when I was a kit, without even noticing me. They pose no danger.’
Squat and Claws declared that they had had no interactions with humans, and they weren’t sure who to believe about the possible threat.
‘Tree Clowder is closer to the humans than River Clowder,’ explained Watcher. ‘I know stories about humans that would make even Brokenear’s hair curl.’
‘Pah!’ Brokenear spat. ‘Why should we listen to someone as worthless as you? No one wants you. I suggest you grow a backbone.’
At this point in the conversation, Bushytail had the distinct feeling (and not for the last time) that he didn’t like Brokenear. He motioned to Watcher to leave the group, and they walked away without responding to the taunt.
Rather than dwell on it, Bushytail decided to query Watcher further about the humans.
‘How close are they?’ he asked. ‘Do you think they could come onto our territory?’
‘They can do anything they like,’ replied Watcher with sincerity. ‘They aren’t rational creatures. They don’t seek land or prey; they just rampage at will. Please, Bushytail, take my advice and steer well clear of them.’
‘I will, my friend, I promise. I will.’
By the time they made their way back to camp it was very late, and Bushytail went straight to his den. Watcher, however, sat up a while longer, standing guard not far away from where Bushytail slept.
Many hours later, when the sun began to rise, Bushytail found Watcher still at his post.
‘Have you slept? Is the danger so great that we must post a constant guard?’ Bushytail asked.
‘I slept,’ came the reply. ‘We might not need a constant guard, but we should definitely be on guard.’
They stayed close that day, but when nothing happened, they relaxed and thought that perhaps, after all, they were mistaken.
Chapter Three:
Prudence is the Greater
Part of Valour
Bushytail was in a hunting party with Squat and Claws. He was larger than many cats, but still able to move soundlessly when needed. He had become accustomed to hunting with others. Typically, Squat and Claws would flush out the prey and Bushytail would launch the attack. Food was becoming less easy to find, but today they were lucky. Two rabbits darted out, and as quick as a flash, Bushytail was after one.
Success in catching rabbits lay in the element of surprise, as cats were no match for rabbits in an open race. This one might have got away, except for the help of his companions. Being skittish creatures, the rabbits practically jumped into Bushytail’s paws when the other two cats appeared. As the cats who made the kill, it was acceptable that they ate the choice parts of the rabbits first and then took the rest back for the others. Between the three of them the meat was soon divided into manageable parts that could be carried in their mouths.
Watcher and Brokenear had also had success hunting, bringing a snake back to camp. As the weather was turning colder, the snakes were often found soaking up the sunshine on rocks.
As always when hunting had been good, spirits were high, but there was still an air of discontent in the group. Life had been easy over the summer, and they all felt safe and secure, but the main reason for a tom to grow strong was to fight and win territory. All of them clearly felt the urge to move on and find a mate. Even Watcher was looking fit and rested after the bountiful summer.
Bushytail had silently resolved to travel south in the spring. He intended to find a clowder and hopefully a mate. It was true that he was large and strong, but he had other advantages that he considered more important. There were many large, strong cats who sought to join a clowder, but he had discovered that winning respect and fostering cooperation also went a long way to ensuring success.
That night, each tom eventually made his way to his own den, curling into a tight ball against the oncoming chill of the night. It seemed the milder weather had come to an abrupt end, as sometimes happens in the high country, with no warning as to the gradual changing of the seasons.
And as abruptly as the weather changed, so did the pattern of their reasonably uneventful lives.
Bushytail shivered through the night and woke early, deciding he needed to move to warm up. As he headed to the entrance of his den, he saw the strangest sight. Everything was white, covered by ice falling from the sky. He had never seen anything like it before. Tentatively, he reached out a paw. The white powder coating everything was soft and cold to touch.
As he stepped out, he beheld with wonder the delicate patterns in the powder on his fur. He took a few nervous steps, noticing the tracks he left behind. He would have to be careful with his footing, but the white covering was not deep. With excitement and trepidation, he set out, slipping and sliding as he went, making his way slowly and carefully along the track.
The appearance of the white covering of ice reminded him how little he had seen of the world and the great many things he might yet experience. It was nice to be out in the silence walking alone once again. The surrounding whiteness gave him a sense of isolation, peacefulness and quietness, while at the same time the falling flakes that swirled around heightened his sense of excitement and expectation.
He sniffed the air. The smell of the noisy machines was very strong here.
Drawn to continue, he crawled along until he came to a clearing that was bordered by an enormous rockface on the opposite side. In the clearing sat four humans around a circle of rocks, and from the rocks sprang red tongues leaping higher with every gust of wind. The humans huddled close to the circle. They were making loud noises: talking, laughing and drinking. They seemed to have constructed some shelters nearby, and they had a noisy machine with them, although it wasn’t turned on. Bushytail had had no idea that a noisy machine could leave its pathway, and the thought filled him with fear, but he was still curious to go closer.
Watcher had warned him not to go near the humans, but Brokenear had said that they were not so bad. They certainly didn’t seem threatening; they were obviously having a good time, joking and laughing. He had observed humans from a distance before, when they were making the structure over the noisy machine pathway, but he had never dared to go close to them. In his own mind, he justified his decision to creep further forward by telling himself that he needed to know more about them firsthand instead of relying on the accounts told to him by others. Slowly, he crept from shadow to shadow, until he could smell the food they were eating.
It was exhilarating being so close. He watched them in fascination, drawing ever closer. Then he saw Watcher. He crouched undetected just outside the circle of light that emanated from the gathering. A feeling of dread crept over Bushytail again, but he firmly pushed it down. He was no coward. He resolved not to be scared just by the mere sight of humans. If Watcher could get close enough to watch them, so could he.
He could see Watcher’s eyes fixed on him, urging him to retreat.
No doubt, the little tom had been scouting in order to warn him. Bushytail felt indignant that his friend should consider him so helpless that he needed protection, and he was determined to show his bravery. Watcher again attempted to signal to Bushytail to go away, with wilder and wilder gestures.
Perhaps thinking that Bushytail hadn’t seen him, Watcher let out a wail.
Immediately, all four humans looked directly at Watcher, detecting his presence.
After that, everything happened quickly.
One of the humans picked up a stick and pointed it at Watcher. There was a loud bang and Watcher fell down. In a matter of seconds, he was silent, and a red stain began to spread from his small body, a stark contrast to the ground’s white covering. Watcher had achieved his goal: the wail had focused the attention of all four humans on Watcher, giving Bushytail the opportunity to escape. The humans walked towards Watcher to see what it was they had killed. There were two more loud bangs, and more laughter.

Prologue
She was exhausted, but she needed to hunt again now if her litter was to survive. She crept out of the den to begin her task as she had done so many times before.
Their den was well concealed, but now that her kits had grown, so had their voices. They were famished, the poor things, so you could hardly blame them for mewing so loudly, but little did they realise the danger in which they put themselves. Only last week a crow had carried off the youngest: she shuddered to think about it.
She knew she would have to take her chances and seek prey at the farmyard again. If she could avoid the dog, the chicks provided easy pickings.
When she finally got to the farmyard, she was in luck. The hens were out of their pen wandering around, chicks trailing after them. It was over in a trice; a flurry of feathers was all there was to show for the missing chick’s whereabouts. She hurried back with the meagre fare, eagerly awaited by her hungry offspring. Sharp little teeth ground through soft bone and cartilage, not even the extremities of the unfortunate fowl remaining unconsumed.
As she watched, her heart grew heavy. Endangering herself to provide for them conflicted with her instinct for self-preservation and yet something kept driving her to take greater and greater risks on their behalf. The almost mutually exclusive instincts constantly warred within her, each vying for dominance. Soon, she knew she would go. All she could leave them were the names she had given them — nothing more. She wondered if the little orange kit would survive on his own, given that his coat made him so visible.
Be safe, Bushytail! she thought. Nature is a cruel taskmaster.
Bushytail was always ravenous. The volumes of lizards, mice and birds he was able to catch provided subsistence sustenance only. It also took a lot of energy for Bushytail to catch his prey, resulting in a physique that was both lean and muscular.
Daily, Bushytail faced a myriad of dangers. Larger predators such as foxes were a threat, as were other feral toms, and then there was the omnipresent danger posed by humans, many of whom, for a variety of reasons, wanted to eradicate feral cats. He had cleverly camouflaged the entrance to his den in a thicket of blackberry bushes to provide a measure of security during his brief sojourns, but it paid to be vigilant at all times.
When Bushytail was a kit, he lived with his mother and siblings, but at a young age he had had to learn the solitary behaviours he now practiced. A wild mother cat couldn’t provide for herself and her kits for very long, but at least she had given him his name, derived from her remembrance of his bushy tail.
Bushytail had only briefly lamented the loss of companion­ship his family had provided, but oftentimes, when he caught the scent of other cats, he felt lonely. When he was old enough and strong enough, he would contest other toms for territory and have a family of his own, but in the meantime, he would hunt and sleep and bide his time. With each passing day he grew wilier. He became bolder in his quest for food, drawing nearer and nearer human habitation, and reaping the rich rewards these opportunities offered.
The depth of winter was no time to travel, but soon, he would have to leave these lands and find his own territory.
Chapter One:
A New Beginning
Bushytail felt strong and confident. Spring was in the air and the privations of winter almost a memory. His belly was full and the sun warm as he stretched out his limbs. He looked around at the scrubby country that was his home. The trees were low and stunted, allowing the plants underneath to flourish. There were any number of strappy plants and ferns and the occasional grasstree. It looked more lovely to him than it had for some time, and he felt a pang of regret that he may not see it again.
It was easy to live in the moment at times like this, but Bushytail knew that it wasn’t time for rest and relaxation. All winter he had been plagued by hunger and the threat of attack from other toms and now it was time to move on. The warmer months were better for travelling, as he would be able to find food more easily on his journey and the need for shelter wasn’t as great. Besides which, he was looking forward to the adventure.
Living as an outsider in someone else’s territory was simply existence, not living. He wanted to be the master of his own domain, with a family and a clowder. Apart from the lack of space here for the growing population of feral cats, there was also the problem that this land was increasingly home to more and more humans. They were exceedingly dangerous, and he wanted to be as far away from them as possible.
Starting out, however, wasn’t as easy as it sounded. The reason no one ever left was that this territory was surrounded by obstacles: the farmland on one side, an expansive concrete river on the other, and on the third an enormous pathway for the smelly machines.
Bushytail had been considering which direction to take for days.
The concrete river seemed the least dangerous, but it was very strange. It had slippery sides that made it impossible to get a paw-grip. From time to time some unfortunates had fallen in by mistake and none had returned. The farmland was good for a daring cat, as there was easy food to be found; however, that was the direction from which all the humans seemed to come, and Bushytail was sure there would be many more of them in the lands beyond. That only left the enormous pathway for the machines, and even though just as many of his kin had died there, it seemed as if it was the only option.
There was an inviting stretch of bushland on the other side of the pathway that awaited any cat who could figure out the secret of traversing the frightening obstacle. I know I can do it! Bushytail told himself.
Cats weren’t the only creatures that had attempted crossing this pathway. There were a number of kangaroos, koalas and birds lying dead along the causeway, delighting only the crows. Granted, cats may be swift, but the fast-paced machines seemed to come out of nowhere, and any contact with them was deadly. Bushytail wasn’t sure that he wanted to risk himself by relying on his speed to cross. He thought that there must be another solution to get across the pathway, and he’d spent many weeks watching and waiting.
Recently, he had noticed some humans behaving strangely. For a reason he couldn’t comprehend, they were building some kind of structure across the deadly path. It had two tall pillars on either side, connected by a long beam with cages at intervals. Inside the cages were bright things like stars flashing. The structure wasn’t large enough for humans to use as a crossing, and he wondered why they would go to the effort of making it. He had memories of his mother warning him of the dangers humans posed, and he was taking no chances. Seeking an opportunity to examine the structure more closely, he watched and waited, keeping his distance.
After the humans left one evening, he examined the structure carefully. Unfortunately, it was built out of strange materials like the river but much more slippery. Even so, Bushytail still thought it was his best escape route, and he felt confident in his strength and agility to cross to safety.
He had dreamed of escape for weeks, convincing himself that beyond lay salvation: a land that had plentiful prey, even in winter. With an optimism granted only to youth, he imagined himself accomplishing great deeds, fighting great battles and winning great victories. He wasn’t a vain cat, but it was natural for one so young to dream of great things to come. So, with this frame of mind, he decided it was time to attempt the crossing.
Today was the day. No more delays.
Bushytail approached the gantry cautiously, sniffing, but the humans were long gone, and the strange structure gave off no scent. Although it was early morning, the noisy machines that went along the path never stopped. He was determined to try his plan of crossing using the structure the humans had made. Getting up would be easier than getting down. There was an overhanging tree on this side of the road. He climbed up and prepared to spring. The large bushy feature for which he was named swished in anticipation as he attempted to balance and take flight. He landed lightly, but slipped slightly on the cold, unyielding surface. Nevertheless, he managed to keep his footing and focused on the beam in front of him.
He was distracted by the constant thrum that came from the machines and the smell emanating from them. He needed nerves of steel, so pushed any other thoughts aside to focus on the oasis on the other side. Eyes firmly forward, he relied on his natural grace as he walked a straight line no wider than a kit’s head. Although he was a skilled climber, the surface was so unstable that each time he placed his paw, there was no margin for error at all. He didn’t let himself think about the danger if he fell, and instead did what cats did best: he lived in the now. His concentration was bent entirely on the placement of his paws, excluding all else.
He didn’t at first notice the putrid stench that began to overcome him. For some reason, an enormous rumbler, much bigger than the rest, had stopped directly beneath him. On its roof, it had a pipe that spewed forth filth. Bushytail could hardly breathe and dropped to a crouch. It was much more difficult to balance in this position, and with the miasma making him weak, he feared to move forward. Self-doubt assailed him, and he began an internal dialogue of self-beration: Why do I attempt this when all others have failed? What is wrong with where I came from anyway? Bushytail knew that his chance of reaching the other side was greatly diminished without his self-belief, and so he tried to put the negative thoughts aside.
Fortunately, the enormous machine moved away, allowing him some respite, and he was able to refocus. It will pass. Focus. You can do it, he told himself. The noise of the machines that kept moving under him, however, still assailed him. Like all cats, Bushytail was proud of his sensitive hearing, but in this situation, it was extremely difficult for him to think clearly with all the noise.
Regaining his composure, he rose and continued as quickly as prudence would allow. He once again focused only on putting one paw in front of the other until he reached the pillar on the far side. By this time, he was trembling, imagining what might have happened had fate not intervened, and he felt dizzy and nauseous from inhaling the fumes.
Although he wasn’t normally scared by heights alone, in his current condition, the view from his position added to his dizziness. He shut his eyes and focused on centring his balance on the precarious perch, making the most of the brief rest this stance afforded him.
He decided to attempt the descent by dangling his back legs off the edge and trying to wrap all four paws around the pillar to slow himself. Cats usually relied on digging their claws into the surface to climb down a tree, but that wasn’t possible given the impenetrable hardness of the pole. Gracelessly, he landed at the bottom with a thud. His heart raced with elation. I’ve done it! I’m on the other side!
He was exhausted and shaking all over. His limbs felt like jelly, and he desperately needed somewhere to rest. He had no energy to go farther. The strange structure seemed to absorb the heat of the day, and right now he found its warmth comforting. He curled himself in a ball in an indentation at the base of the pillar and fell asleep immediately.
Bushytail awoke hours later to find himself huddled against an icy mass, disoriented and alone. Shaking himself awake, he assessed his situation. He had planned to begin his journey in the glorious warmth of a spring day, enjoying the new scenery stretching before him. Of course, cats often travelled at night, having excellent night vision, but most tended to be crepuscular, that is, most active at dawn and dusk. There was no food to be had in the middle of the night and no way to see what might lie further afield to give him a sign by which he might steer. Nevertheless, Bushytail felt it was best to move away from the machines and set off, trusting to luck.
His encounter over the pathway had unsettled him more than he cared to admit. His great adventure had only just begun, and due to his lack of experience and foresight, he had nearly fallen at the first hurdle. He was flighty, jumping at the small unidentified night noises and the wind whistling in his ears. After a time, his nerves settled and he began to feel reassured by the familiar smells of the bushland, its plants and creatures. The night sky was clear and the air crisp and invigorating. The strength had returned to his muscles, and he revelled in the feel of them moving in unison to propel him.
Shortly, however, his thoughts turned to water, and he realised that he did, in fact, have a raging thirst and a sore throat, probably on account of the foul air he had inhaled. He headed downhill, reasoning that that would be his best chance of finding a water source. It wasn’t long before he could hear the familiar sounds telling him that a watercourse was indeed nearby, but being experienced in such matters, he didn’t rush in to drink without looking, knowing that water attracted all kinds of other creatures.
The moon emerged briefly from a grey coat for just long enough for him to see that he had reached a wide bend in the river, which appeared almost as a lake, surrounded by impressive rotund river gums. The moonlight shimmered on its surface invitingly and he approached carefully, using all of his senses to confirm that the coast was clear. When he was sure that there was no scent of other cats or humans nearby, he crouched and lapped the water greedily.
Sated, he moved soundlessly into the understory and surveyed the scene. As he sat there, he took in the beauty of the country in which he found himself. Beyond the watery vista towered tall mountains, reflected perfectly in the pond’s surface. The plants were all ones he knew, but the trees had become taller, shooting so far into the sky that he couldn’t see their tops. It was a big country and a big sky, and he suddenly felt very small.
He searched for somewhere safe to rest for what was left of the night. Lone toms were vulnerable when sleeping and finding a temporary place to rest for an evening was an undertaking that required careful consideration. Bushytail had unusual colouring, light fur with an orange tinge, which stood out in the mute colours of the bushland, and therefore he had to take care that he was well hidden. Thorn bushes often provided good cover, but a cat had to be careful that they weren’t already occupied.
Being extra cautious, Bushytail opted to climb a tree. This wasn’t the usual preferred sleeping place for a cat, but Bushytail had excellent balance and, as this was unknown territory, considered it the safest option. Being lean, he was able to climb up a good way and still find strong boughs to support him. Although the tree didn’t do much to provide camouflage, from experience he knew that predators rarely looked up: particularly humans.
As the tree branches gently swayed, lulling him towards sleep, he finally had a chance to reflect on his success. He had taken a huge risk today crossing the path of the noisy machines. It was the first time in his short life that he had done anything so daring. In fact, as he was a very young tom, he had really not done much yet other than avoid danger, hunt and find safe places to sleep.
He had been vaguely excited by the idea of what might be awaiting him in the vast bushland, but he hadn’t really given much thought as to what to do once he got here or what possible dangers he might face. He decided that he needed more information and made up his mind to go looking for it tomorrow. Are there cats nearby? Humans? What dangers will I encounter? He was keen to test his strength against another tom in a real fight, but he had no desire to seriously injure any cat in the process. His exhaustion eventually outweighed his curiosity, and he continued his meandering thoughts through the pathways of his dreams, the sensations only serving to heighten his desire.
He woke with a longing to start his adventure.
Chapter Two:
Well Met, Stranger
Dawn was fast approaching, heralded by the onset of the early carollers. With interest, Bushytail observed the world awakening and in particular the many birds seeking the water source. As tempting as it was to make a sudden lunge in an attempt to catch one, he held still, waiting for the right moment, only to find another cat easily as big as himself make the catch gracefully, mid-air, avoiding the treacherous slide into the river. However, Bushytail remained still, hoping to stay unseen to give him time to weigh up his options.
He then decided that attack was the best form of defence and reasoned that catching this unknown cat off-guard while he was absorbed with his prey would give Bushytail the advantage. The other cat was heading his way and would pass directly beneath him. All he had to do was wait for the right moment to strike. He planned to spring onto his opponent’s back, sharp claws digging in, and teeth latched on. He knew that it would be difficult to dislodge him from this position; the effort would be sure to tire his adversary.
Inexplicably, however, he went sailing through the air, missing his target altogether. He landed awkwardly, making an horrendous noise: his presence announced to all and sundry. To his surprise, the cat didn’t press his advantage, instead asking him a question.
‘Who are you?’ the stranger asked him.
Bushytail knew that this could just be a tactic to buy time, but he found himself responding anyway. ‘I’m an outsider. I walk alone.’
‘Stranger, I am no threat to you. Walk on by,’ came the response. There was no sense of fear or anxiety in the voice. The strange cat exuded confidence and calmness.
‘Stranger I may be, but not so green as to turn my back to you,’ replied Bushytail.
‘Then let me,’ said the stranger, and he turned and walked away.
The strange cat could have done nothing that would have surprised him more greatly. Were all the rules changed in this country that toms would simply let one another pass? How did I miss my opponent in the first place? Although he was inexperienced in fighting, he knew his reflexes were good and that his blow should have found its mark. The stranger had not even paused to retrieve the prey he had caught.
Warily, Bushytail eyed the fallen prey. He maintained his crouch for a full five minutes, using all his senses to detect the return of the hunter who had felled the prize, but eventually hunger won out and he devoured the creature rapidly. The feeling of a full belly quickly dispelled the uneasiness he had been experiencing. The sun was warm, but not too hot, and the temptation to bask was great, but he knew that while the sun was high, he needed to find a vantage point from which to get his bearings.
So, he started travelling uphill.
It wasn’t difficult terrain, but being out of his known territory, he flitted from tree to tree and the journey took much longer than it might have ordinarily. By the time he reached the summit, his muscles ached. Licking his paws, he looked out to behold the most amazing sight he had ever seen: a sea of trees as far as the eye could see. He had never imagined such an oasis existed. Surely there would be room in this vast tract of land for him. Bushytail was startled out of his wonder by a familiar voice.
‘Well met, stranger.’
He couldn’t believe his incaution. The tom must have tracked him and now came on him unawares.
‘Why have you followed me?’ demanded Bushytail.
‘Nay, stranger, I did not follow you,’ came the cryptic reply.
To his dismay, Bushytail saw that he was now surrounded by a motley-looking crew of toms. From the wide variety of markings they bore, they didn’t appear to be a clowder. It was very unusual for toms to work together, and he cursed his luck that he had stumbled upon a group that looked to have a unified purpose.
‘It seems that you have, albeit unknowingly, stumbled upon our stronghold. As you know, stray toms are often shunned by clowders, and existing as a loner can be dangerous. We decided our best chance of survival was to band together, and this rocky outcrop is the place we call home. You are in our territory now.’
‘Safety in numbers, you say? I can’t argue with that, given the position I’m in! What do you intend to do?’ Bushytail inquired.
‘That depends on you. The choice is yours: go or stay.’
Bushytail quickly considered his options. He didn’t want to give up his quest so quickly, but he needed knowledge of this new land, and perhaps this strange band of misfits could supply him with that knowledge. ‘Thank you,’ he replied, ‘as strange as your offer is, I believe I could use your help and you mine. I will stay.’
‘Well chosen,’ came the reply.
In turn, the cats introduced themselves. In the manner of their kind, all had names that referred to their physical attributes: Bristle, Claws, Squat and Brokenear. All except one, the smallest tom, who went by the name of Watcher. Although they banded together when necessary, they still preferred solitude, and each had their own den with its own entrance in the pile of rocks and brambles. The plateau provided a natural defence, as it was easy to see anyone or anything approaching. They shared hunting duties in order for someone to always maintain a watch. They even offered to hunt for Bushytail while he made a den for himself. He was glad to accept the offer and have a safe place to sleep for the night, as he had still not fully recovered from the effects of the foul air that he had inhaled on the gantry. He spent the day making a hollow indentation, well protected by rocks and thorn bushes and lined with dry grasses.
When dusk fell, the hunters returned. Birds were abundant in these highlands and there was plenty for all. Bushytail explained to his companions that the small territory from which he had come was getting smaller each day due to the arrival of more humans. They marvelled that he had passed over the noisy machines. One of the reasons they had their outpost here was that it was so close to the concrete pathway that others feared to come near.
They told him that there were two big clowders in this area: River Clowder and Tree Clowder. Last spring had been kind and many kits were born, but with the onset of winter, there were too many mouths to feed, and some of the older toms had to leave. Squat and Claws were from River Clowder, and Watcher was from Tree Clowder. Brokenear was from a place far to the east, filled with humans. Bristle was their leader, as he had arrived first and, as Bushytail had already noted, had an air of confidence that compelled others to do his bidding. Bristle didn’t say from which direction he had travelled.
As the days passed and Bushytail settled into a routine in his new life, he found that he very much enjoyed the companion­ship he was experiencing for the first time. Toms were solitary creatures, but with that also came deprivation and hardship. The mild spring weather combined with the reduced need to hunt resulted in ample leisure time, which was generally spent with his companions, and the young cats, having no responsibilities, frolicked and generally wasted their time — and relished doing so. Never before had Bushytail been carefree, and he was grateful for the humour his new companions provided.
Squat and Claws usually hunted together, as did Brokenear and Watcher, while Bristle kept watch. Brokenear, however, often complained loudly about the ineptitude of his partner, so Bushytail most often joined this pair, as much as to lend support to the little fellow as to help to equal the amount of prey brought in by the other party. During these long periods where they hunted together, Bushytail came to know his companions well.
Brokenear was continually haughty, with an overblown sense of entitlement. Bushytail got the feeling that Brokenear thought the others well beneath him. Brokenear told tales of wonder about the place he had left as a kit. There were thousands of humans, and all the surfaces were hard like the noisy machine path and the strange river. There were houses taller than trees. Brokenear was born on the streets of this place, but he said there were some cats who lived with the humans and let the humans touch them! Bushytail didn’t think that he would like to journey there.
Brokenear didn’t hide his leadership ambitions, telling Bushytail at length about how he was going to find a clowder and challenge for leadership. He plied the toms from River Clowder and Tree Clowder with questions, clearly seeking information that would help him best choose where to make a challenge.
Bushytail’s companions taught him how to hunt cooperatively; a concept with which he was wholly unfamiliar if indeed it had ever been done before in catkind history. With more than one cat hunting the same prey, one or more cats could flush out the prey and direct it into the waiting paws at the designated place. In addition, being clowderless, the toms had no kits or elderly for which to provide, resulting in an abundance of food the likes of which Bushytail had never experienced.
Despite the ease of this lifestyle, Bushytail still felt discontent. He had always imagined that nothing could be more important than a full belly. Indeed, when one was hungry, there was little consideration of anything else, but once this goal had been achieved, the soul still hungered. While he had companionship, it wasn’t the same as having family and clowder. There were no she-cats here and no kits. Nevertheless, he was in no hurry to forgo the convenience of his current situation and pushed down his feelings of unease.
In the evenings, they generally sat together, sharing the day’s hunt and exchanging stories.
Squat and Claws weren’t far from the lands where they had been born and were the least worried about their rogue status in their clowder. It was usual for young toms to go off on their own for a while when they were young and see the world. The pair were fast friends and had a carefree attitude, which made them very good company.
On the occasions when Bushytail did join the pair for hunting, the three companions had great fun with mock battles, delighting in surprising one another or putting obstacles in one another’s paths, and laughing with good humour when one of their pranks resulted in someone losing their balance. Bushytail had parted with his siblings when he was very young and revelled in the frivolity of these young companions.
True to his name, Watcher didn’t contribute overly to the evening’s conversations. He had left Tree Clowder due to his small size, which prevented him from fulfilling hunting duties as well as other cats, and he had no plans to reclaim a clowder for himself. Of all the toms in the company, he was the only member resigned to remaining an ‘outsider’.
As the others circled to converse, Watcher did indeed cut a forlorn figure, and as such, Bushytail was drawn to him. He felt a need to protect him and help him find a way to overcome his difficulties. He spent many hours at his side in silence, comforting merely with his presence. Slowly but surely, a bond grew between them, and the shy little tom looked upon Bushytail with adoring eyes whenever he appeared. Watcher took to following Bushytail around camp, trying to anticipate his needs and bringing him the best cuts of meat: all for a little kindness.
Bristle remained as much of a mystery as ever. He often sat alone at the lookout point, seemingly staring at nothing. He was always courteous but was never warm to his companions. He would give them advice about where to look for prey when the hunting was difficult, or on occasion interject in an argument when tempers became frayed, but he didn’t give much away about himself.
Nevertheless, Bushytail couldn’t help but admire Bristle’s composure. He seemed to have no need for the company or the hunting skills of his companions, as he was a masterful hunter. Indeed, Bushytail wondered why Bristle remained with the rag-tag little company. When Bushytail pressed him for answers, Bristle simply told him that he had a purpose, and he had no choice but to follow the path laid out for him. This answer, however, didn’t satisfy Bushytail at all.
Brokenear, on the other hand, was happy to answer Bushytail’s questions.
‘When do you think you will set out to find a clowder, Brokenear? Surely you are strong enough now to take on any challenger?’ Bushytail questioned.
‘There is more to being a leader than just being strong. I certainly don’t intend to be fighting constant battles to keep my leadership. If we can work together to make our life easier, surely a clowder could also? I think I can use the things we have learnt hunting together to make a clowder stronger.’
Bushytail was intrigued.
By the end of spring, Bushytail was at peak fitness. He was no longer lean, his elongated frame having been built up with muscle. The playfights with Squat and Claws, combined with the daily traversing of the high-country terrain, had ensured that his days of leisure didn’t overly impact his physical abilities in a negative way. His coat was shiny, glossy and well groomed. He felt that there was nothing he couldn’t accomplish. He took to roaming the perimeter of the camp by himself of a morning and evening, gazing at the vista, and wondering what lay beyond. Watcher would sometimes accompany him. The quiet and unobtrusive nature of his companion suited his mood, and Watcher seemed to appreciate Bushytail’s need for companionship.
At times, Bushytail found himself telling Watcher things he had never told any other cat, almost as if he was talking to himself. He told him of his siblings and his mother, and the stress of being hungry and cold. He told him of his longing to find a mate and to be part of a clowder where he would protect elders and kits. He told him of his adventures and hopes and dreams, and in doing so, perhaps began to understand himself a little better, growing in wisdom as well as stature. As time went by, it was rare for the two to be apart, the symbiotic relationship being beneficial to both parties as they gained strength and healed.
On occasions, the pair was joined by Bristle. He too seemed to take comfort in silence as they sat on the peak of the mountain with the late evening sun blanketing them with its soft diffused light and the gentle breeze blowing on their faces. Squat and Claws had told Bushytail that they found the sight of the three statues silhouetted against the sky amusing and that they had no idea what possible solace a cat found in this absurd activity. The only time Squat and Claws would stay still was to stalk prey, and then only for as long as was absolutely necessary.
Nevertheless, Bushytail valued the diversity of his companions and the different aspects of life that his experiences with them offered. They were an odd band, but he was growing fond of them all in different ways. The only one he was still not sure about was Brokenear. There was something about him that was unsettling.
It was the end of yet another day, and the disparate members of the company were enjoying the rewards of a good day’s hunting. They had eaten well and were stretching and grooming themselves as the sun set.
Unusually, it was Watcher who began the conversation this evening. ‘There’s been a strange smell on the air these past few days. It’s like the smell of the noisy machines has become stronger. Have you smelt it?’
‘Don’t be ridiculous!’ mocked Brokenear. ‘You jump at the sight of your own shadow. There are no pathways here large enough for the noisy machines. It is your imagination playing tricks on you, my worthless excuse for a hunting partner.’
Bushytail was naturally protective of his new-found friend. How dare you speak to him like that, he thought, but before he had a chance to leap to Watcher’s defence, Bristle interjected.
‘Nay, Watcher sees what is. It is true. The humans are drawing near. You would do well to heed our observant friend.’
‘I am not scared of humans,’ boasted Brokenear. ‘Many of them passed me every day when I was a kit, without even noticing me. They pose no danger.’
Squat and Claws declared that they had had no interactions with humans, and they weren’t sure who to believe about the possible threat.
‘Tree Clowder is closer to the humans than River Clowder,’ explained Watcher. ‘I know stories about humans that would make even Brokenear’s hair curl.’
‘Pah!’ Brokenear spat. ‘Why should we listen to someone as worthless as you? No one wants you. I suggest you grow a backbone.’
At this point in the conversation, Bushytail had the distinct feeling (and not for the last time) that he didn’t like Brokenear. He motioned to Watcher to leave the group, and they walked away without responding to the taunt.
Rather than dwell on it, Bushytail decided to query Watcher further about the humans.
‘How close are they?’ he asked. ‘Do you think they could come onto our territory?’
‘They can do anything they like,’ replied Watcher with sincerity. ‘They aren’t rational creatures. They don’t seek land or prey; they just rampage at will. Please, Bushytail, take my advice and steer well clear of them.’
‘I will, my friend, I promise. I will.’
By the time they made their way back to camp it was very late, and Bushytail went straight to his den. Watcher, however, sat up a while longer, standing guard not far away from where Bushytail slept.
Many hours later, when the sun began to rise, Bushytail found Watcher still at his post.
‘Have you slept? Is the danger so great that we must post a constant guard?’ Bushytail asked.
‘I slept,’ came the reply. ‘We might not need a constant guard, but we should definitely be on guard.’
They stayed close that day, but when nothing happened, they relaxed and thought that perhaps, after all, they were mistaken.
Chapter Three:
Prudence is the Greater
Part of Valour
Bushytail was in a hunting party with Squat and Claws. He was larger than many cats, but still able to move soundlessly when needed. He had become accustomed to hunting with others. Typically, Squat and Claws would flush out the prey and Bushytail would launch the attack. Food was becoming less easy to find, but today they were lucky. Two rabbits darted out, and as quick as a flash, Bushytail was after one.
Success in catching rabbits lay in the element of surprise, as cats were no match for rabbits in an open race. This one might have got away, except for the help of his companions. Being skittish creatures, the rabbits practically jumped into Bushytail’s paws when the other two cats appeared. As the cats who made the kill, it was acceptable that they ate the choice parts of the rabbits first and then took the rest back for the others. Between the three of them the meat was soon divided into manageable parts that could be carried in their mouths.
Watcher and Brokenear had also had success hunting, bringing a snake back to camp. As the weather was turning colder, the snakes were often found soaking up the sunshine on rocks.
As always when hunting had been good, spirits were high, but there was still an air of discontent in the group. Life had been easy over the summer, and they all felt safe and secure, but the main reason for a tom to grow strong was to fight and win territory. All of them clearly felt the urge to move on and find a mate. Even Watcher was looking fit and rested after the bountiful summer.
Bushytail had silently resolved to travel south in the spring. He intended to find a clowder and hopefully a mate. It was true that he was large and strong, but he had other advantages that he considered more important. There were many large, strong cats who sought to join a clowder, but he had discovered that winning respect and fostering cooperation also went a long way to ensuring success.
That night, each tom eventually made his way to his own den, curling into a tight ball against the oncoming chill of the night. It seemed the milder weather had come to an abrupt end, as sometimes happens in the high country, with no warning as to the gradual changing of the seasons.
And as abruptly as the weather changed, so did the pattern of their reasonably uneventful lives.
Bushytail shivered through the night and woke early, deciding he needed to move to warm up. As he headed to the entrance of his den, he saw the strangest sight. Everything was white, covered by ice falling from the sky. He had never seen anything like it before. Tentatively, he reached out a paw. The white powder coating everything was soft and cold to touch.
As he stepped out, he beheld with wonder the delicate patterns in the powder on his fur. He took a few nervous steps, noticing the tracks he left behind. He would have to be careful with his footing, but the white covering was not deep. With excitement and trepidation, he set out, slipping and sliding as he went, making his way slowly and carefully along the track.
The appearance of the white covering of ice reminded him how little he had seen of the world and the great many things he might yet experience. It was nice to be out in the silence walking alone once again. The surrounding whiteness gave him a sense of isolation, peacefulness and quietness, while at the same time the falling flakes that swirled around heightened his sense of excitement and expectation.
He sniffed the air. The smell of the noisy machines was very strong here.
Drawn to continue, he crawled along until he came to a clearing that was bordered by an enormous rockface on the opposite side. In the clearing sat four humans around a circle of rocks, and from the rocks sprang red tongues leaping higher with every gust of wind. The humans huddled close to the circle. They were making loud noises: talking, laughing and drinking. They seemed to have constructed some shelters nearby, and they had a noisy machine with them, although it wasn’t turned on. Bushytail had had no idea that a noisy machine could leave its pathway, and the thought filled him with fear, but he was still curious to go closer.
Watcher had warned him not to go near the humans, but Brokenear had said that they were not so bad. They certainly didn’t seem threatening; they were obviously having a good time, joking and laughing. He had observed humans from a distance before, when they were making the structure over the noisy machine pathway, but he had never dared to go close to them. In his own mind, he justified his decision to creep further forward by telling himself that he needed to know more about them firsthand instead of relying on the accounts told to him by others. Slowly, he crept from shadow to shadow, until he could smell the food they were eating.
It was exhilarating being so close. He watched them in fascination, drawing ever closer. Then he saw Watcher. He crouched undetected just outside the circle of light that emanated from the gathering. A feeling of dread crept over Bushytail again, but he firmly pushed it down. He was no coward. He resolved not to be scared just by the mere sight of humans. If Watcher could get close enough to watch them, so could he.
He could see Watcher’s eyes fixed on him, urging him to retreat.
No doubt, the little tom had been scouting in order to warn him. Bushytail felt indignant that his friend should consider him so helpless that he needed protection, and he was determined to show his bravery. Watcher again attempted to signal to Bushytail to go away, with wilder and wilder gestures.
Perhaps thinking that Bushytail hadn’t seen him, Watcher let out a wail.
Immediately, all four humans looked directly at Watcher, detecting his presence.
After that, everything happened quickly.
One of the humans picked up a stick and pointed it at Watcher. There was a loud bang and Watcher fell down. In a matter of seconds, he was silent, and a red stain began to spread from his small body, a stark contrast to the ground’s white covering. Watcher had achieved his goal: the wail had focused the attention of all four humans on Watcher, giving Bushytail the opportunity to escape. The humans walked towards Watcher to see what it was they had killed. There were two more loud bangs, and more laughter.

High Clowder Cats
50 ratings","In the book “High Clowder Cats” by Ruby Knight, you will join Bushytail on his adventure, where he will meet new cats throughout the story. On his adventure, he experiences ups and downs that have either strengthened or led him to question his life. His main lesson is to learn to be still and see what is. Will Bushytail understand what that means, and will his dreams come true? Is Bushytail prepared for the challenges awaiting him? I never would have thought to read a cat book, much less enjoy it! “High Clowder Cats” is such a fun book to read! I thought I wouldn’t enjoy the book but ended up loving it. At the beginning of reading the book, I thought it was going to be a boring book about the life of cats, as my perception of cats is that they only nap or wander around the streets. However, as I continued reading the book, the author introduced a variety of actions as the story unfolded. The book is well written, with only one minor error found. “He landed awkwardly, making an horrendous noise: his presence announced to all and sundry” (pg. 18). I rate the book a five out of five because it exceeded my expectations. Reading this book made me more open to different genres and styles of books. I liked how the author’s writing was both witty and insightful, allowing me to enjoy the book while also receiving meaningful messages. I don't think anything should be changed, as the storyline was intriguing and taught me more about the struggles that cats go through in their lifetime.

Prologue
She was exhausted, but she needed to hunt again now if her litter was to survive. She crept out of the den to begin her task as she had done so many times before.
Their den was well concealed, but now that her kits had grown, so had their voices. They were famished, the poor things, so you could hardly blame them for mewing so loudly, but little did they realise the danger in which they put themselves. Only last week a crow had carried off the youngest: she shuddered to think about it.
She knew she would have to take her chances and seek prey at the farmyard again. If she could avoid the dog, the chicks provided easy pickings.
When she finally got to the farmyard, she was in luck. The hens were out of their pen wandering around, chicks trailing after them. It was over in a trice; a flurry of feathers was all there was to show for the missing chick’s whereabouts. She hurried back with the meagre fare, eagerly awaited by her hungry offspring. Sharp little teeth ground through soft bone and cartilage, not even the extremities of the unfortunate fowl remaining unconsumed.
As she watched, her heart grew heavy. Endangering herself to provide for them conflicted with her instinct for self-preservation and yet something kept driving her to take greater and greater risks on their behalf. The almost mutually exclusive instincts constantly warred within her, each vying for dominance. Soon, she knew she would go. All she could leave them were the names she had given them — nothing more. She wondered if the little orange kit would survive on his own, given that his coat made him so visible.
Be safe, Bushytail! she thought. Nature is a cruel taskmaster.
Bushytail was always ravenous. The volumes of lizards, mice and birds he was able to catch provided subsistence sustenance only. It also took a lot of energy for Bushytail to catch his prey, resulting in a physique that was both lean and muscular.
Daily, Bushytail faced a myriad of dangers. Larger predators such as foxes were a threat, as were other feral toms, and then there was the omnipresent danger posed by humans, many of whom, for a variety of reasons, wanted to eradicate feral cats. He had cleverly camouflaged the entrance to his den in a thicket of blackberry bushes to provide a measure of security during his brief sojourns, but it paid to be vigilant at all times.
When Bushytail was a kit, he lived with his mother and siblings, but at a young age he had had to learn the solitary behaviours he now practiced. A wild mother cat couldn’t provide for herself and her kits for very long, but at least she had given him his name, derived from her remembrance of his bushy tail.
Bushytail had only briefly lamented the loss of companion­ship his family had provided, but oftentimes, when he caught the scent of other cats, he felt lonely. When he was old enough and strong enough, he would contest other toms for territory and have a family of his own, but in the meantime, he would hunt and sleep and bide his time. With each passing day he grew wilier. He became bolder in his quest for food, drawing nearer and nearer human habitation, and reaping the rich rewards these opportunities offered.
The depth of winter was no time to travel, but soon, he would have to leave these lands and find his own territory.
Chapter One:
A New Beginning
Bushytail felt strong and confident. Spring was in the air and the privations of winter almost a memory. His belly was full and the sun warm as he stretched out his limbs. He looked around at the scrubby country that was his home. The trees were low and stunted, allowing the plants underneath to flourish. There were any number of strappy plants and ferns and the occasional grasstree. It looked more lovely to him than it had for some time, and he felt a pang of regret that he may not see it again.
It was easy to live in the moment at times like this, but Bushytail knew that it wasn’t time for rest and relaxation. All winter he had been plagued by hunger and the threat of attack from other toms and now it was time to move on. The warmer months were better for travelling, as he would be able to find food more easily on his journey and the need for shelter wasn’t as great. Besides which, he was looking forward to the adventure.
Living as an outsider in someone else’s territory was simply existence, not living. He wanted to be the master of his own domain, with a family and a clowder. Apart from the lack of space here for the growing population of feral cats, there was also the problem that this land was increasingly home to more and more humans. They were exceedingly dangerous, and he wanted to be as far away from them as possible.
Starting out, however, wasn’t as easy as it sounded. The reason no one ever left was that this territory was surrounded by obstacles: the farmland on one side, an expansive concrete river on the other, and on the third an enormous pathway for the smelly machines.
Bushytail had been considering which direction to take for days.
The concrete river seemed the least dangerous, but it was very strange. It had slippery sides that made it impossible to get a paw-grip. From time to time some unfortunates had fallen in by mistake and none had returned. The farmland was good for a daring cat, as there was easy food to be found; however, that was the direction from which all the humans seemed to come, and Bushytail was sure there would be many more of them in the lands beyond. That only left the enormous pathway for the machines, and even though just as many of his kin had died there, it seemed as if it was the only option.
There was an inviting stretch of bushland on the other side of the pathway that awaited any cat who could figure out the secret of traversing the frightening obstacle. I know I can do it! Bushytail told himself.
Cats weren’t the only creatures that had attempted crossing this pathway. There were a number of kangaroos, koalas and birds lying dead along the causeway, delighting only the crows. Granted, cats may be swift, but the fast-paced machines seemed to come out of nowhere, and any contact with them was deadly. Bushytail wasn’t sure that he wanted to risk himself by relying on his speed to cross. He thought that there must be another solution to get across the pathway, and he’d spent many weeks watching and waiting.
Recently, he had noticed some humans behaving strangely. For a reason he couldn’t comprehend, they were building some kind of structure across the deadly path. It had two tall pillars on either side, connected by a long beam with cages at intervals. Inside the cages were bright things like stars flashing. The structure wasn’t large enough for humans to use as a crossing, and he wondered why they would go to the effort of making it. He had memories of his mother warning him of the dangers humans posed, and he was taking no chances. Seeking an opportunity to examine the structure more closely, he watched and waited, keeping his distance.
After the humans left one evening, he examined the structure carefully. Unfortunately, it was built out of strange materials like the river but much more slippery. Even so, Bushytail still thought it was his best escape route, and he felt confident in his strength and agility to cross to safety.
He had dreamed of escape for weeks, convincing himself that beyond lay salvation: a land that had plentiful prey, even in winter. With an optimism granted only to youth, he imagined himself accomplishing great deeds, fighting great battles and winning great victories. He wasn’t a vain cat, but it was natural for one so young to dream of great things to come. So, with this frame of mind, he decided it was time to attempt the crossing.
Today was the day. No more delays.
Bushytail approached the gantry cautiously, sniffing, but the humans were long gone, and the strange structure gave off no scent. Although it was early morning, the noisy machines that went along the path never stopped. He was determined to try his plan of crossing using the structure the humans had made. Getting up would be easier than getting down. There was an overhanging tree on this side of the road. He climbed up and prepared to spring. The large bushy feature for which he was named swished in anticipation as he attempted to balance and take flight. He landed lightly, but slipped slightly on the cold, unyielding surface. Nevertheless, he managed to keep his footing and focused on the beam in front of him.
He was distracted by the constant thrum that came from the machines and the smell emanating from them. He needed nerves of steel, so pushed any other thoughts aside to focus on the oasis on the other side. Eyes firmly forward, he relied on his natural grace as he walked a straight line no wider than a kit’s head. Although he was a skilled climber, the surface was so unstable that each time he placed his paw, there was no margin for error at all. He didn’t let himself think about the danger if he fell, and instead did what cats did best: he lived in the now. His concentration was bent entirely on the placement of his paws, excluding all else.
He didn’t at first notice the putrid stench that began to overcome him. For some reason, an enormous rumbler, much bigger than the rest, had stopped directly beneath him. On its roof, it had a pipe that spewed forth filth. Bushytail could hardly breathe and dropped to a crouch. It was much more difficult to balance in this position, and with the miasma making him weak, he feared to move forward. Self-doubt assailed him, and he began an internal dialogue of self-beration: Why do I attempt this when all others have failed? What is wrong with where I came from anyway? Bushytail knew that his chance of reaching the other side was greatly diminished without his self-belief, and so he tried to put the negative thoughts aside.
Fortunately, the enormous machine moved away, allowing him some respite, and he was able to refocus. It will pass. Focus. You can do it, he told himself. The noise of the machines that kept moving under him, however, still assailed him. Like all cats, Bushytail was proud of his sensitive hearing, but in this situation, it was extremely difficult for him to think clearly with all the noise.
Regaining his composure, he rose and continued as quickly as prudence would allow. He once again focused only on putting one paw in front of the other until he reached the pillar on the far side. By this time, he was trembling, imagining what might have happened had fate not intervened, and he felt dizzy and nauseous from inhaling the fumes.
Although he wasn’t normally scared by heights alone, in his current condition, the view from his position added to his dizziness. He shut his eyes and focused on centring his balance on the precarious perch, making the most of the brief rest this stance afforded him.
He decided to attempt the descent by dangling his back legs off the edge and trying to wrap all four paws around the pillar to slow himself. Cats usually relied on digging their claws into the surface to climb down a tree, but that wasn’t possible given the impenetrable hardness of the pole. Gracelessly, he landed at the bottom with a thud. His heart raced with elation. I’ve done it! I’m on the other side!
He was exhausted and shaking all over. His limbs felt like jelly, and he desperately needed somewhere to rest. He had no energy to go farther. The strange structure seemed to absorb the heat of the day, and right now he found its warmth comforting. He curled himself in a ball in an indentation at the base of the pillar and fell asleep immediately.
Bushytail awoke hours later to find himself huddled against an icy mass, disoriented and alone. Shaking himself awake, he assessed his situation. He had planned to begin his journey in the glorious warmth of a spring day, enjoying the new scenery stretching before him. Of course, cats often travelled at night, having excellent night vision, but most tended to be crepuscular, that is, most active at dawn and dusk. There was no food to be had in the middle of the night and no way to see what might lie further afield to give him a sign by which he might steer. Nevertheless, Bushytail felt it was best to move away from the machines and set off, trusting to luck.
His encounter over the pathway had unsettled him more than he cared to admit. His great adventure had only just begun, and due to his lack of experience and foresight, he had nearly fallen at the first hurdle. He was flighty, jumping at the small unidentified night noises and the wind whistling in his ears. After a time, his nerves settled and he began to feel reassured by the familiar smells of the bushland, its plants and creatures. The night sky was clear and the air crisp and invigorating. The strength had returned to his muscles, and he revelled in the feel of them moving in unison to propel him.
Shortly, however, his thoughts turned to water, and he realised that he did, in fact, have a raging thirst and a sore throat, probably on account of the foul air he had inhaled. He headed downhill, reasoning that that would be his best chance of finding a water source. It wasn’t long before he could hear the familiar sounds telling him that a watercourse was indeed nearby, but being experienced in such matters, he didn’t rush in to drink without looking, knowing that water attracted all kinds of other creatures.
The moon emerged briefly from a grey coat for just long enough for him to see that he had reached a wide bend in the river, which appeared almost as a lake, surrounded by impressive rotund river gums. The moonlight shimmered on its surface invitingly and he approached carefully, using all of his senses to confirm that the coast was clear. When he was sure that there was no scent of other cats or humans nearby, he crouched and lapped the water greedily.
Sated, he moved soundlessly into the understory and surveyed the scene. As he sat there, he took in the beauty of the country in which he found himself. Beyond the watery vista towered tall mountains, reflected perfectly in the pond’s surface. The plants were all ones he knew, but the trees had become taller, shooting so far into the sky that he couldn’t see their tops. It was a big country and a big sky, and he suddenly felt very small.
He searched for somewhere safe to rest for what was left of the night. Lone toms were vulnerable when sleeping and finding a temporary place to rest for an evening was an undertaking that required careful consideration. Bushytail had unusual colouring, light fur with an orange tinge, which stood out in the mute colours of the bushland, and therefore he had to take care that he was well hidden. Thorn bushes often provided good cover, but a cat had to be careful that they weren’t already occupied.
Being extra cautious, Bushytail opted to climb a tree. This wasn’t the usual preferred sleeping place for a cat, but Bushytail had excellent balance and, as this was unknown territory, considered it the safest option. Being lean, he was able to climb up a good way and still find strong boughs to support him. Although the tree didn’t do much to provide camouflage, from experience he knew that predators rarely looked up: particularly humans.
As the tree branches gently swayed, lulling him towards sleep, he finally had a chance to reflect on his success. He had taken a huge risk today crossing the path of the noisy machines. It was the first time in his short life that he had done anything so daring. In fact, as he was a very young tom, he had really not done much yet other than avoid danger, hunt and find safe places to sleep.
He had been vaguely excited by the idea of what might be awaiting him in the vast bushland, but he hadn’t really given much thought as to what to do once he got here or what possible dangers he might face. He decided that he needed more information and made up his mind to go looking for it tomorrow. Are there cats nearby? Humans? What dangers will I encounter? He was keen to test his strength against another tom in a real fight, but he had no desire to seriously injure any cat in the process. His exhaustion eventually outweighed his curiosity, and he continued his meandering thoughts through the pathways of his dreams, the sensations only serving to heighten his desire.
He woke with a longing to start his adventure.
Chapter Two:
Well Met, Stranger
Dawn was fast approaching, heralded by the onset of the early carollers. With interest, Bushytail observed the world awakening and in particular the many birds seeking the water source. As tempting as it was to make a sudden lunge in an attempt to catch one, he held still, waiting for the right moment, only to find another cat easily as big as himself make the catch gracefully, mid-air, avoiding the treacherous slide into the river. However, Bushytail remained still, hoping to stay unseen to give him time to weigh up his options.
He then decided that attack was the best form of defence and reasoned that catching this unknown cat off-guard while he was absorbed with his prey would give Bushytail the advantage. The other cat was heading his way and would pass directly beneath him. All he had to do was wait for the right moment to strike. He planned to spring onto his opponent’s back, sharp claws digging in, and teeth latched on. He knew that it would be difficult to dislodge him from this position; the effort would be sure to tire his adversary.
Inexplicably, however, he went sailing through the air, missing his target altogether. He landed awkwardly, making an horrendous noise: his presence announced to all and sundry. To his surprise, the cat didn’t press his advantage, instead asking him a question.
‘Who are you?’ the stranger asked him.
Bushytail knew that this could just be a tactic to buy time, but he found himself responding anyway. ‘I’m an outsider. I walk alone.’
‘Stranger, I am no threat to you. Walk on by,’ came the response. There was no sense of fear or anxiety in the voice. The strange cat exuded confidence and calmness.
‘Stranger I may be, but not so green as to turn my back to you,’ replied Bushytail.
‘Then let me,’ said the stranger, and he turned and walked away.
The strange cat could have done nothing that would have surprised him more greatly. Were all the rules changed in this country that toms would simply let one another pass? How did I miss my opponent in the first place? Although he was inexperienced in fighting, he knew his reflexes were good and that his blow should have found its mark. The stranger had not even paused to retrieve the prey he had caught.
Warily, Bushytail eyed the fallen prey. He maintained his crouch for a full five minutes, using all his senses to detect the return of the hunter who had felled the prize, but eventually hunger won out and he devoured the creature rapidly. The feeling of a full belly quickly dispelled the uneasiness he had been experiencing. The sun was warm, but not too hot, and the temptation to bask was great, but he knew that while the sun was high, he needed to find a vantage point from which to get his bearings.
So, he started travelling uphill.
It wasn’t difficult terrain, but being out of his known territory, he flitted from tree to tree and the journey took much longer than it might have ordinarily. By the time he reached the summit, his muscles ached. Licking his paws, he looked out to behold the most amazing sight he had ever seen: a sea of trees as far as the eye could see. He had never imagined such an oasis existed. Surely there would be room in this vast tract of land for him. Bushytail was startled out of his wonder by a familiar voice.
‘Well met, stranger.’
He couldn’t believe his incaution. The tom must have tracked him and now came on him unawares.
‘Why have you followed me?’ demanded Bushytail.
‘Nay, stranger, I did not follow you,’ came the cryptic reply.
To his dismay, Bushytail saw that he was now surrounded by a motley-looking crew of toms. From the wide variety of markings they bore, they didn’t appear to be a clowder. It was very unusual for toms to work together, and he cursed his luck that he had stumbled upon a group that looked to have a unified purpose.
‘It seems that you have, albeit unknowingly, stumbled upon our stronghold. As you know, stray toms are often shunned by clowders, and existing as a loner can be dangerous. We decided our best chance of survival was to band together, and this rocky outcrop is the place we call home. You are in our territory now.’
‘Safety in numbers, you say? I can’t argue with that, given the position I’m in! What do you intend to do?’ Bushytail inquired.
‘That depends on you. The choice is yours: go or stay.’
Bushytail quickly considered his options. He didn’t want to give up his quest so quickly, but he needed knowledge of this new land, and perhaps this strange band of misfits could supply him with that knowledge. ‘Thank you,’ he replied, ‘as strange as your offer is, I believe I could use your help and you mine. I will stay.’
‘Well chosen,’ came the reply.
In turn, the cats introduced themselves. In the manner of their kind, all had names that referred to their physical attributes: Bristle, Claws, Squat and Brokenear. All except one, the smallest tom, who went by the name of Watcher. Although they banded together when necessary, they still preferred solitude, and each had their own den with its own entrance in the pile of rocks and brambles. The plateau provided a natural defence, as it was easy to see anyone or anything approaching. They shared hunting duties in order for someone to always maintain a watch. They even offered to hunt for Bushytail while he made a den for himself. He was glad to accept the offer and have a safe place to sleep for the night, as he had still not fully recovered from the effects of the foul air that he had inhaled on the gantry. He spent the day making a hollow indentation, well protected by rocks and thorn bushes and lined with dry grasses.
When dusk fell, the hunters returned. Birds were abundant in these highlands and there was plenty for all. Bushytail explained to his companions that the small territory from which he had come was getting smaller each day due to the arrival of more humans. They marvelled that he had passed over the noisy machines. One of the reasons they had their outpost here was that it was so close to the concrete pathway that others feared to come near.
They told him that there were two big clowders in this area: River Clowder and Tree Clowder. Last spring had been kind and many kits were born, but with the onset of winter, there were too many mouths to feed, and some of the older toms had to leave. Squat and Claws were from River Clowder, and Watcher was from Tree Clowder. Brokenear was from a place far to the east, filled with humans. Bristle was their leader, as he had arrived first and, as Bushytail had already noted, had an air of confidence that compelled others to do his bidding. Bristle didn’t say from which direction he had travelled.
As the days passed and Bushytail settled into a routine in his new life, he found that he very much enjoyed the companion­ship he was experiencing for the first time. Toms were solitary creatures, but with that also came deprivation and hardship. The mild spring weather combined with the reduced need to hunt resulted in ample leisure time, which was generally spent with his companions, and the young cats, having no responsibilities, frolicked and generally wasted their time — and relished doing so. Never before had Bushytail been carefree, and he was grateful for the humour his new companions provided.
Squat and Claws usually hunted together, as did Brokenear and Watcher, while Bristle kept watch. Brokenear, however, often complained loudly about the ineptitude of his partner, so Bushytail most often joined this pair, as much as to lend support to the little fellow as to help to equal the amount of prey brought in by the other party. During these long periods where they hunted together, Bushytail came to know his companions well.
Brokenear was continually haughty, with an overblown sense of entitlement. Bushytail got the feeling that Brokenear thought the others well beneath him. Brokenear told tales of wonder about the place he had left as a kit. There were thousands of humans, and all the surfaces were hard like the noisy machine path and the strange river. There were houses taller than trees. Brokenear was born on the streets of this place, but he said there were some cats who lived with the humans and let the humans touch them! Bushytail didn’t think that he would like to journey there.
Brokenear didn’t hide his leadership ambitions, telling Bushytail at length about how he was going to find a clowder and challenge for leadership. He plied the toms from River Clowder and Tree Clowder with questions, clearly seeking information that would help him best choose where to make a challenge.
Bushytail’s companions taught him how to hunt cooperatively; a concept with which he was wholly unfamiliar if indeed it had ever been done before in catkind history. With more than one cat hunting the same prey, one or more cats could flush out the prey and direct it into the waiting paws at the designated place. In addition, being clowderless, the toms had no kits or elderly for which to provide, resulting in an abundance of food the likes of which Bushytail had never experienced.
Despite the ease of this lifestyle, Bushytail still felt discontent. He had always imagined that nothing could be more important than a full belly. Indeed, when one was hungry, there was little consideration of anything else, but once this goal had been achieved, the soul still hungered. While he had companionship, it wasn’t the same as having family and clowder. There were no she-cats here and no kits. Nevertheless, he was in no hurry to forgo the convenience of his current situation and pushed down his feelings of unease.
In the evenings, they generally sat together, sharing the day’s hunt and exchanging stories.
Squat and Claws weren’t far from the lands where they had been born and were the least worried about their rogue status in their clowder. It was usual for young toms to go off on their own for a while when they were young and see the world. The pair were fast friends and had a carefree attitude, which made them very good company.
On the occasions when Bushytail did join the pair for hunting, the three companions had great fun with mock battles, delighting in surprising one another or putting obstacles in one another’s paths, and laughing with good humour when one of their pranks resulted in someone losing their balance. Bushytail had parted with his siblings when he was very young and revelled in the frivolity of these young companions.
True to his name, Watcher didn’t contribute overly to the evening’s conversations. He had left Tree Clowder due to his small size, which prevented him from fulfilling hunting duties as well as other cats, and he had no plans to reclaim a clowder for himself. Of all the toms in the company, he was the only member resigned to remaining an ‘outsider’.
As the others circled to converse, Watcher did indeed cut a forlorn figure, and as such, Bushytail was drawn to him. He felt a need to protect him and help him find a way to overcome his difficulties. He spent many hours at his side in silence, comforting merely with his presence. Slowly but surely, a bond grew between them, and the shy little tom looked upon Bushytail with adoring eyes whenever he appeared. Watcher took to following Bushytail around camp, trying to anticipate his needs and bringing him the best cuts of meat: all for a little kindness.
Bristle remained as much of a mystery as ever. He often sat alone at the lookout point, seemingly staring at nothing. He was always courteous but was never warm to his companions. He would give them advice about where to look for prey when the hunting was difficult, or on occasion interject in an argument when tempers became frayed, but he didn’t give much away about himself.
Nevertheless, Bushytail couldn’t help but admire Bristle’s composure. He seemed to have no need for the company or the hunting skills of his companions, as he was a masterful hunter. Indeed, Bushytail wondered why Bristle remained with the rag-tag little company. When Bushytail pressed him for answers, Bristle simply told him that he had a purpose, and he had no choice but to follow the path laid out for him. This answer, however, didn’t satisfy Bushytail at all.
Brokenear, on the other hand, was happy to answer Bushytail’s questions.
‘When do you think you will set out to find a clowder, Brokenear? Surely you are strong enough now to take on any challenger?’ Bushytail questioned.
‘There is more to being a leader than just being strong. I certainly don’t intend to be fighting constant battles to keep my leadership. If we can work together to make our life easier, surely a clowder could also? I think I can use the things we have learnt hunting together to make a clowder stronger.’
Bushytail was intrigued.
By the end of spring, Bushytail was at peak fitness. He was no longer lean, his elongated frame having been built up with muscle. The playfights with Squat and Claws, combined with the daily traversing of the high-country terrain, had ensured that his days of leisure didn’t overly impact his physical abilities in a negative way. His coat was shiny, glossy and well groomed. He felt that there was nothing he couldn’t accomplish. He took to roaming the perimeter of the camp by himself of a morning and evening, gazing at the vista, and wondering what lay beyond. Watcher would sometimes accompany him. The quiet and unobtrusive nature of his companion suited his mood, and Watcher seemed to appreciate Bushytail’s need for companionship.
At times, Bushytail found himself telling Watcher things he had never told any other cat, almost as if he was talking to himself. He told him of his siblings and his mother, and the stress of being hungry and cold. He told him of his longing to find a mate and to be part of a clowder where he would protect elders and kits. He told him of his adventures and hopes and dreams, and in doing so, perhaps began to understand himself a little better, growing in wisdom as well as stature. As time went by, it was rare for the two to be apart, the symbiotic relationship being beneficial to both parties as they gained strength and healed.
On occasions, the pair was joined by Bristle. He too seemed to take comfort in silence as they sat on the peak of the mountain with the late evening sun blanketing them with its soft diffused light and the gentle breeze blowing on their faces. Squat and Claws had told Bushytail that they found the sight of the three statues silhouetted against the sky amusing and that they had no idea what possible solace a cat found in this absurd activity. The only time Squat and Claws would stay still was to stalk prey, and then only for as long as was absolutely necessary.
Nevertheless, Bushytail valued the diversity of his companions and the different aspects of life that his experiences with them offered. They were an odd band, but he was growing fond of them all in different ways. The only one he was still not sure about was Brokenear. There was something about him that was unsettling.
It was the end of yet another day, and the disparate members of the company were enjoying the rewards of a good day’s hunting. They had eaten well and were stretching and grooming themselves as the sun set.
Unusually, it was Watcher who began the conversation this evening. ‘There’s been a strange smell on the air these past few days. It’s like the smell of the noisy machines has become stronger. Have you smelt it?’
‘Don’t be ridiculous!’ mocked Brokenear. ‘You jump at the sight of your own shadow. There are no pathways here large enough for the noisy machines. It is your imagination playing tricks on you, my worthless excuse for a hunting partner.’
Bushytail was naturally protective of his new-found friend. How dare you speak to him like that, he thought, but before he had a chance to leap to Watcher’s defence, Bristle interjected.
‘Nay, Watcher sees what is. It is true. The humans are drawing near. You would do well to heed our observant friend.’
‘I am not scared of humans,’ boasted Brokenear. ‘Many of them passed me every day when I was a kit, without even noticing me. They pose no danger.’
Squat and Claws declared that they had had no interactions with humans, and they weren’t sure who to believe about the possible threat.
‘Tree Clowder is closer to the humans than River Clowder,’ explained Watcher. ‘I know stories about humans that would make even Brokenear’s hair curl.’
‘Pah!’ Brokenear spat. ‘Why should we listen to someone as worthless as you? No one wants you. I suggest you grow a backbone.’
At this point in the conversation, Bushytail had the distinct feeling (and not for the last time) that he didn’t like Brokenear. He motioned to Watcher to leave the group, and they walked away without responding to the taunt.
Rather than dwell on it, Bushytail decided to query Watcher further about the humans.
‘How close are they?’ he asked. ‘Do you think they could come onto our territory?’
‘They can do anything they like,’ replied Watcher with sincerity. ‘They aren’t rational creatures. They don’t seek land or prey; they just rampage at will. Please, Bushytail, take my advice and steer well clear of them.’
‘I will, my friend, I promise. I will.’
By the time they made their way back to camp it was very late, and Bushytail went straight to his den. Watcher, however, sat up a while longer, standing guard not far away from where Bushytail slept.
Many hours later, when the sun began to rise, Bushytail found Watcher still at his post.
‘Have you slept? Is the danger so great that we must post a constant guard?’ Bushytail asked.
‘I slept,’ came the reply. ‘We might not need a constant guard, but we should definitely be on guard.’
They stayed close that day, but when nothing happened, they relaxed and thought that perhaps, after all, they were mistaken.
Chapter Three:
Prudence is the Greater
Part of Valour
Bushytail was in a hunting party with Squat and Claws. He was larger than many cats, but still able to move soundlessly when needed. He had become accustomed to hunting with others. Typically, Squat and Claws would flush out the prey and Bushytail would launch the attack. Food was becoming less easy to find, but today they were lucky. Two rabbits darted out, and as quick as a flash, Bushytail was after one.
Success in catching rabbits lay in the element of surprise, as cats were no match for rabbits in an open race. This one might have got away, except for the help of his companions. Being skittish creatures, the rabbits practically jumped into Bushytail’s paws when the other two cats appeared. As the cats who made the kill, it was acceptable that they ate the choice parts of the rabbits first and then took the rest back for the others. Between the three of them the meat was soon divided into manageable parts that could be carried in their mouths.
Watcher and Brokenear had also had success hunting, bringing a snake back to camp. As the weather was turning colder, the snakes were often found soaking up the sunshine on rocks.
As always when hunting had been good, spirits were high, but there was still an air of discontent in the group. Life had been easy over the summer, and they all felt safe and secure, but the main reason for a tom to grow strong was to fight and win territory. All of them clearly felt the urge to move on and find a mate. Even Watcher was looking fit and rested after the bountiful summer.
Bushytail had silently resolved to travel south in the spring. He intended to find a clowder and hopefully a mate. It was true that he was large and strong, but he had other advantages that he considered more important. There were many large, strong cats who sought to join a clowder, but he had discovered that winning respect and fostering cooperation also went a long way to ensuring success.
That night, each tom eventually made his way to his own den, curling into a tight ball against the oncoming chill of the night. It seemed the milder weather had come to an abrupt end, as sometimes happens in the high country, with no warning as to the gradual changing of the seasons.
And as abruptly as the weather changed, so did the pattern of their reasonably uneventful lives.
Bushytail shivered through the night and woke early, deciding he needed to move to warm up. As he headed to the entrance of his den, he saw the strangest sight. Everything was white, covered by ice falling from the sky. He had never seen anything like it before. Tentatively, he reached out a paw. The white powder coating everything was soft and cold to touch.
As he stepped out, he beheld with wonder the delicate patterns in the powder on his fur. He took a few nervous steps, noticing the tracks he left behind. He would have to be careful with his footing, but the white covering was not deep. With excitement and trepidation, he set out, slipping and sliding as he went, making his way slowly and carefully along the track.
The appearance of the white covering of ice reminded him how little he had seen of the world and the great many things he might yet experience. It was nice to be out in the silence walking alone once again. The surrounding whiteness gave him a sense of isolation, peacefulness and quietness, while at the same time the falling flakes that swirled around heightened his sense of excitement and expectation.
He sniffed the air. The smell of the noisy machines was very strong here.
Drawn to continue, he crawled along until he came to a clearing that was bordered by an enormous rockface on the opposite side. In the clearing sat four humans around a circle of rocks, and from the rocks sprang red tongues leaping higher with every gust of wind. The humans huddled close to the circle. They were making loud noises: talking, laughing and drinking. They seemed to have constructed some shelters nearby, and they had a noisy machine with them, although it wasn’t turned on. Bushytail had had no idea that a noisy machine could leave its pathway, and the thought filled him with fear, but he was still curious to go closer.
Watcher had warned him not to go near the humans, but Brokenear had said that they were not so bad. They certainly didn’t seem threatening; they were obviously having a good time, joking and laughing. He had observed humans from a distance before, when they were making the structure over the noisy machine pathway, but he had never dared to go close to them. In his own mind, he justified his decision to creep further forward by telling himself that he needed to know more about them firsthand instead of relying on the accounts told to him by others. Slowly, he crept from shadow to shadow, until he could smell the food they were eating.
It was exhilarating being so close. He watched them in fascination, drawing ever closer. Then he saw Watcher. He crouched undetected just outside the circle of light that emanated from the gathering. A feeling of dread crept over Bushytail again, but he firmly pushed it down. He was no coward. He resolved not to be scared just by the mere sight of humans. If Watcher could get close enough to watch them, so could he.
He could see Watcher’s eyes fixed on him, urging him to retreat.
No doubt, the little tom had been scouting in order to warn him. Bushytail felt indignant that his friend should consider him so helpless that he needed protection, and he was determined to show his bravery. Watcher again attempted to signal to Bushytail to go away, with wilder and wilder gestures.
Perhaps thinking that Bushytail hadn’t seen him, Watcher let out a wail.
Immediately, all four humans looked directly at Watcher, detecting his presence.
After that, everything happened quickly.
One of the humans picked up a stick and pointed it at Watcher. There was a loud bang and Watcher fell down. In a matter of seconds, he was silent, and a red stain began to spread from his small body, a stark contrast to the ground’s white covering. Watcher had achieved his goal: the wail had focused the attention of all four humans on Watcher, giving Bushytail the opportunity to escape. The humans walked towards Watcher to see what it was they had killed. There were two more loud bangs, and more laughter.

Prologue
She was exhausted, but she needed to hunt again now if her litter was to survive. She crept out of the den to begin her task as she had done so many times before.
Their den was well concealed, but now that her kits had grown, so had their voices. They were famished, the poor things, so you could hardly blame them for mewing so loudly, but little did they realise the danger in which they put themselves. Only last week a crow had carried off the youngest: she shuddered to think about it.
She knew she would have to take her chances and seek prey at the farmyard again. If she could avoid the dog, the chicks provided easy pickings.
When she finally got to the farmyard, she was in luck. The hens were out of their pen wandering around, chicks trailing after them. It was over in a trice; a flurry of feathers was all there was to show for the missing chick’s whereabouts. She hurried back with the meagre fare, eagerly awaited by her hungry offspring. Sharp little teeth ground through soft bone and cartilage, not even the extremities of the unfortunate fowl remaining unconsumed.
As she watched, her heart grew heavy. Endangering herself to provide for them conflicted with her instinct for self-preservation and yet something kept driving her to take greater and greater risks on their behalf. The almost mutually exclusive instincts constantly warred within her, each vying for dominance. Soon, she knew she would go. All she could leave them were the names she had given them — nothing more. She wondered if the little orange kit would survive on his own, given that his coat made him so visible.
Be safe, Bushytail! she thought. Nature is a cruel taskmaster.
Bushytail was always ravenous. The volumes of lizards, mice and birds he was able to catch provided subsistence sustenance only. It also took a lot of energy for Bushytail to catch his prey, resulting in a physique that was both lean and muscular.
Daily, Bushytail faced a myriad of dangers. Larger predators such as foxes were a threat, as were other feral toms, and then there was the omnipresent danger posed by humans, many of whom, for a variety of reasons, wanted to eradicate feral cats. He had cleverly camouflaged the entrance to his den in a thicket of blackberry bushes to provide a measure of security during his brief sojourns, but it paid to be vigilant at all times.
When Bushytail was a kit, he lived with his mother and siblings, but at a young age he had had to learn the solitary behaviours he now practiced. A wild mother cat couldn’t provide for herself and her kits for very long, but at least she had given him his name, derived from her remembrance of his bushy tail.
Bushytail had only briefly lamented the loss of companion­ship his family had provided, but oftentimes, when he caught the scent of other cats, he felt lonely. When he was old enough and strong enough, he would contest other toms for territory and have a family of his own, but in the meantime, he would hunt and sleep and bide his time. With each passing day he grew wilier. He became bolder in his quest for food, drawing nearer and nearer human habitation, and reaping the rich rewards these opportunities offered.
The depth of winter was no time to travel, but soon, he would have to leave these lands and find his own territory.
Chapter One:
A New Beginning
Bushytail felt strong and confident. Spring was in the air and the privations of winter almost a memory. His belly was full and the sun warm as he stretched out his limbs. He looked around at the scrubby country that was his home. The trees were low and stunted, allowing the plants underneath to flourish. There were any number of strappy plants and ferns and the occasional grasstree. It looked more lovely to him than it had for some time, and he felt a pang of regret that he may not see it again.
It was easy to live in the moment at times like this, but Bushytail knew that it wasn’t time for rest and relaxation. All winter he had been plagued by hunger and the threat of attack from other toms and now it was time to move on. The warmer months were better for travelling, as he would be able to find food more easily on his journey and the need for shelter wasn’t as great. Besides which, he was looking forward to the adventure.
Living as an outsider in someone else’s territory was simply existence, not living. He wanted to be the master of his own domain, with a family and a clowder. Apart from the lack of space here for the growing population of feral cats, there was also the problem that this land was increasingly home to more and more humans. They were exceedingly dangerous, and he wanted to be as far away from them as possible.
Starting out, however, wasn’t as easy as it sounded. The reason no one ever left was that this territory was surrounded by obstacles: the farmland on one side, an expansive concrete river on the other, and on the third an enormous pathway for the smelly machines.
Bushytail had been considering which direction to take for days.
The concrete river seemed the least dangerous, but it was very strange. It had slippery sides that made it impossible to get a paw-grip. From time to time some unfortunates had fallen in by mistake and none had returned. The farmland was good for a daring cat, as there was easy food to be found; however, that was the direction from which all the humans seemed to come, and Bushytail was sure there would be many more of them in the lands beyond. That only left the enormous pathway for the machines, and even though just as many of his kin had died there, it seemed as if it was the only option.
There was an inviting stretch of bushland on the other side of the pathway that awaited any cat who could figure out the secret of traversing the frightening obstacle. I know I can do it! Bushytail told himself.
Cats weren’t the only creatures that had attempted crossing this pathway. There were a number of kangaroos, koalas and birds lying dead along the causeway, delighting only the crows. Granted, cats may be swift, but the fast-paced machines seemed to come out of nowhere, and any contact with them was deadly. Bushytail wasn’t sure that he wanted to risk himself by relying on his speed to cross. He thought that there must be another solution to get across the pathway, and he’d spent many weeks watching and waiting.
Recently, he had noticed some humans behaving strangely. For a reason he couldn’t comprehend, they were building some kind of structure across the deadly path. It had two tall pillars on either side, connected by a long beam with cages at intervals. Inside the cages were bright things like stars flashing. The structure wasn’t large enough for humans to use as a crossing, and he wondered why they would go to the effort of making it. He had memories of his mother warning him of the dangers humans posed, and he was taking no chances. Seeking an opportunity to examine the structure more closely, he watched and waited, keeping his distance.
After the humans left one evening, he examined the structure carefully. Unfortunately, it was built out of strange materials like the river but much more slippery. Even so, Bushytail still thought it was his best escape route, and he felt confident in his strength and agility to cross to safety.
He had dreamed of escape for weeks, convincing himself that beyond lay salvation: a land that had plentiful prey, even in winter. With an optimism granted only to youth, he imagined himself accomplishing great deeds, fighting great battles and winning great victories. He wasn’t a vain cat, but it was natural for one so young to dream of great things to come. So, with this frame of mind, he decided it was time to attempt the crossing.
Today was the day. No more delays.
Bushytail approached the gantry cautiously, sniffing, but the humans were long gone, and the strange structure gave off no scent. Although it was early morning, the noisy machines that went along the path never stopped. He was determined to try his plan of crossing using the structure the humans had made. Getting up would be easier than getting down. There was an overhanging tree on this side of the road. He climbed up and prepared to spring. The large bushy feature for which he was named swished in anticipation as he attempted to balance and take flight. He landed lightly, but slipped slightly on the cold, unyielding surface. Nevertheless, he managed to keep his footing and focused on the beam in front of him.
He was distracted by the constant thrum that came from the machines and the smell emanating from them. He needed nerves of steel, so pushed any other thoughts aside to focus on the oasis on the other side. Eyes firmly forward, he relied on his natural grace as he walked a straight line no wider than a kit’s head. Although he was a skilled climber, the surface was so unstable that each time he placed his paw, there was no margin for error at all. He didn’t let himself think about the danger if he fell, and instead did what cats did best: he lived in the now. His concentration was bent entirely on the placement of his paws, excluding all else.
He didn’t at first notice the putrid stench that began to overcome him. For some reason, an enormous rumbler, much bigger than the rest, had stopped directly beneath him. On its roof, it had a pipe that spewed forth filth. Bushytail could hardly breathe and dropped to a crouch. It was much more difficult to balance in this position, and with the miasma making him weak, he feared to move forward. Self-doubt assailed him, and he began an internal dialogue of self-beration: Why do I attempt this when all others have failed? What is wrong with where I came from anyway? Bushytail knew that his chance of reaching the other side was greatly diminished without his self-belief, and so he tried to put the negative thoughts aside.
Fortunately, the enormous machine moved away, allowing him some respite, and he was able to refocus. It will pass. Focus. You can do it, he told himself. The noise of the machines that kept moving under him, however, still assailed him. Like all cats, Bushytail was proud of his sensitive hearing, but in this situation, it was extremely difficult for him to think clearly with all the noise.
Regaining his composure, he rose and continued as quickly as prudence would allow. He once again focused only on putting one paw in front of the other until he reached the pillar on the far side. By this time, he was trembling, imagining what might have happened had fate not intervened, and he felt dizzy and nauseous from inhaling the fumes.
Although he wasn’t normally scared by heights alone, in his current condition, the view from his position added to his dizziness. He shut his eyes and focused on centring his balance on the precarious perch, making the most of the brief rest this stance afforded him.
He decided to attempt the descent by dangling his back legs off the edge and trying to wrap all four paws around the pillar to slow himself. Cats usually relied on digging their claws into the surface to climb down a tree, but that wasn’t possible given the impenetrable hardness of the pole. Gracelessly, he landed at the bottom with a thud. His heart raced with elation. I’ve done it! I’m on the other side!
He was exhausted and shaking all over. His limbs felt like jelly, and he desperately needed somewhere to rest. He had no energy to go farther. The strange structure seemed to absorb the heat of the day, and right now he found its warmth comforting. He curled himself in a ball in an indentation at the base of the pillar and fell asleep immediately.
Bushytail awoke hours later to find himself huddled against an icy mass, disoriented and alone. Shaking himself awake, he assessed his situation. He had planned to begin his journey in the glorious warmth of a spring day, enjoying the new scenery stretching before him. Of course, cats often travelled at night, having excellent night vision, but most tended to be crepuscular, that is, most active at dawn and dusk. There was no food to be had in the middle of the night and no way to see what might lie further afield to give him a sign by which he might steer. Nevertheless, Bushytail felt it was best to move away from the machines and set off, trusting to luck.
His encounter over the pathway had unsettled him more than he cared to admit. His great adventure had only just begun, and due to his lack of experience and foresight, he had nearly fallen at the first hurdle. He was flighty, jumping at the small unidentified night noises and the wind whistling in his ears. After a time, his nerves settled and he began to feel reassured by the familiar smells of the bushland, its plants and creatures. The night sky was clear and the air crisp and invigorating. The strength had returned to his muscles, and he revelled in the feel of them moving in unison to propel him.
Shortly, however, his thoughts turned to water, and he realised that he did, in fact, have a raging thirst and a sore throat, probably on account of the foul air he had inhaled. He headed downhill, reasoning that that would be his best chance of finding a water source. It wasn’t long before he could hear the familiar sounds telling him that a watercourse was indeed nearby, but being experienced in such matters, he didn’t rush in to drink without looking, knowing that water attracted all kinds of other creatures.
The moon emerged briefly from a grey coat for just long enough for him to see that he had reached a wide bend in the river, which appeared almost as a lake, surrounded by impressive rotund river gums. The moonlight shimmered on its surface invitingly and he approached carefully, using all of his senses to confirm that the coast was clear. When he was sure that there was no scent of other cats or humans nearby, he crouched and lapped the water greedily.
Sated, he moved soundlessly into the understory and surveyed the scene. As he sat there, he took in the beauty of the country in which he found himself. Beyond the watery vista towered tall mountains, reflected perfectly in the pond’s surface. The plants were all ones he knew, but the trees had become taller, shooting so far into the sky that he couldn’t see their tops. It was a big country and a big sky, and he suddenly felt very small.
He searched for somewhere safe to rest for what was left of the night. Lone toms were vulnerable when sleeping and finding a temporary place to rest for an evening was an undertaking that required careful consideration. Bushytail had unusual colouring, light fur with an orange tinge, which stood out in the mute colours of the bushland, and therefore he had to take care that he was well hidden. Thorn bushes often provided good cover, but a cat had to be careful that they weren’t already occupied.
Being extra cautious, Bushytail opted to climb a tree. This wasn’t the usual preferred sleeping place for a cat, but Bushytail had excellent balance and, as this was unknown territory, considered it the safest option. Being lean, he was able to climb up a good way and still find strong boughs to support him. Although the tree didn’t do much to provide camouflage, from experience he knew that predators rarely looked up: particularly humans.
As the tree branches gently swayed, lulling him towards sleep, he finally had a chance to reflect on his success. He had taken a huge risk today crossing the path of the noisy machines. It was the first time in his short life that he had done anything so daring. In fact, as he was a very young tom, he had really not done much yet other than avoid danger, hunt and find safe places to sleep.
He had been vaguely excited by the idea of what might be awaiting him in the vast bushland, but he hadn’t really given much thought as to what to do once he got here or what possible dangers he might face. He decided that he needed more information and made up his mind to go looking for it tomorrow. Are there cats nearby? Humans? What dangers will I encounter? He was keen to test his strength against another tom in a real fight, but he had no desire to seriously injure any cat in the process. His exhaustion eventually outweighed his curiosity, and he continued his meandering thoughts through the pathways of his dreams, the sensations only serving to heighten his desire.
He woke with a longing to start his adventure.
Chapter Two:
Well Met, Stranger
Dawn was fast approaching, heralded by the onset of the early carollers. With interest, Bushytail observed the world awakening and in particular the many birds seeking the water source. As tempting as it was to make a sudden lunge in an attempt to catch one, he held still, waiting for the right moment, only to find another cat easily as big as himself make the catch gracefully, mid-air, avoiding the treacherous slide into the river. However, Bushytail remained still, hoping to stay unseen to give him time to weigh up his options.
He then decided that attack was the best form of defence and reasoned that catching this unknown cat off-guard while he was absorbed with his prey would give Bushytail the advantage. The other cat was heading his way and would pass directly beneath him. All he had to do was wait for the right moment to strike. He planned to spring onto his opponent’s back, sharp claws digging in, and teeth latched on. He knew that it would be difficult to dislodge him from this position; the effort would be sure to tire his adversary.
Inexplicably, however, he went sailing through the air, missing his target altogether. He landed awkwardly, making an horrendous noise: his presence announced to all and sundry. To his surprise, the cat didn’t press his advantage, instead asking him a question.
‘Who are you?’ the stranger asked him.
Bushytail knew that this could just be a tactic to buy time, but he found himself responding anyway. ‘I’m an outsider. I walk alone.’
‘Stranger, I am no threat to you. Walk on by,’ came the response. There was no sense of fear or anxiety in the voice. The strange cat exuded confidence and calmness.
‘Stranger I may be, but not so green as to turn my back to you,’ replied Bushytail.
‘Then let me,’ said the stranger, and he turned and walked away.
The strange cat could have done nothing that would have surprised him more greatly. Were all the rules changed in this country that toms would simply let one another pass? How did I miss my opponent in the first place? Although he was inexperienced in fighting, he knew his reflexes were good and that his blow should have found its mark. The stranger had not even paused to retrieve the prey he had caught.
Warily, Bushytail eyed the fallen prey. He maintained his crouch for a full five minutes, using all his senses to detect the return of the hunter who had felled the prize, but eventually hunger won out and he devoured the creature rapidly. The feeling of a full belly quickly dispelled the uneasiness he had been experiencing. The sun was warm, but not too hot, and the temptation to bask was great, but he knew that while the sun was high, he needed to find a vantage point from which to get his bearings.
So, he started travelling uphill.
It wasn’t difficult terrain, but being out of his known territory, he flitted from tree to tree and the journey took much longer than it might have ordinarily. By the time he reached the summit, his muscles ached. Licking his paws, he looked out to behold the most amazing sight he had ever seen: a sea of trees as far as the eye could see. He had never imagined such an oasis existed. Surely there would be room in this vast tract of land for him. Bushytail was startled out of his wonder by a familiar voice.
‘Well met, stranger.’
He couldn’t believe his incaution. The tom must have tracked him and now came on him unawares.
‘Why have you followed me?’ demanded Bushytail.
‘Nay, stranger, I did not follow you,’ came the cryptic reply.
To his dismay, Bushytail saw that he was now surrounded by a motley-looking crew of toms. From the wide variety of markings they bore, they didn’t appear to be a clowder. It was very unusual for toms to work together, and he cursed his luck that he had stumbled upon a group that looked to have a unified purpose.
‘It seems that you have, albeit unknowingly, stumbled upon our stronghold. As you know, stray toms are often shunned by clowders, and existing as a loner can be dangerous. We decided our best chance of survival was to band together, and this rocky outcrop is the place we call home. You are in our territory now.’
‘Safety in numbers, you say? I can’t argue with that, given the position I’m in! What do you intend to do?’ Bushytail inquired.
‘That depends on you. The choice is yours: go or stay.’
Bushytail quickly considered his options. He didn’t want to give up his quest so quickly, but he needed knowledge of this new land, and perhaps this strange band of misfits could supply him with that knowledge. ‘Thank you,’ he replied, ‘as strange as your offer is, I believe I could use your help and you mine. I will stay.’
‘Well chosen,’ came the reply.
In turn, the cats introduced themselves. In the manner of their kind, all had names that referred to their physical attributes: Bristle, Claws, Squat and Brokenear. All except one, the smallest tom, who went by the name of Watcher. Although they banded together when necessary, they still preferred solitude, and each had their own den with its own entrance in the pile of rocks and brambles. The plateau provided a natural defence, as it was easy to see anyone or anything approaching. They shared hunting duties in order for someone to always maintain a watch. They even offered to hunt for Bushytail while he made a den for himself. He was glad to accept the offer and have a safe place to sleep for the night, as he had still not fully recovered from the effects of the foul air that he had inhaled on the gantry. He spent the day making a hollow indentation, well protected by rocks and thorn bushes and lined with dry grasses.
When dusk fell, the hunters returned. Birds were abundant in these highlands and there was plenty for all. Bushytail explained to his companions that the small territory from which he had come was getting smaller each day due to the arrival of more humans. They marvelled that he had passed over the noisy machines. One of the reasons they had their outpost here was that it was so close to the concrete pathway that others feared to come near.
They told him that there were two big clowders in this area: River Clowder and Tree Clowder. Last spring had been kind and many kits were born, but with the onset of winter, there were too many mouths to feed, and some of the older toms had to leave. Squat and Claws were from River Clowder, and Watcher was from Tree Clowder. Brokenear was from a place far to the east, filled with humans. Bristle was their leader, as he had arrived first and, as Bushytail had already noted, had an air of confidence that compelled others to do his bidding. Bristle didn’t say from which direction he had travelled.
As the days passed and Bushytail settled into a routine in his new life, he found that he very much enjoyed the companion­ship he was experiencing for the first time. Toms were solitary creatures, but with that also came deprivation and hardship. The mild spring weather combined with the reduced need to hunt resulted in ample leisure time, which was generally spent with his companions, and the young cats, having no responsibilities, frolicked and generally wasted their time — and relished doing so. Never before had Bushytail been carefree, and he was grateful for the humour his new companions provided.
Squat and Claws usually hunted together, as did Brokenear and Watcher, while Bristle kept watch. Brokenear, however, often complained loudly about the ineptitude of his partner, so Bushytail most often joined this pair, as much as to lend support to the little fellow as to help to equal the amount of prey brought in by the other party. During these long periods where they hunted together, Bushytail came to know his companions well.
Brokenear was continually haughty, with an overblown sense of entitlement. Bushytail got the feeling that Brokenear thought the others well beneath him. Brokenear told tales of wonder about the place he had left as a kit. There were thousands of humans, and all the surfaces were hard like the noisy machine path and the strange river. There were houses taller than trees. Brokenear was born on the streets of this place, but he said there were some cats who lived with the humans and let the humans touch them! Bushytail didn’t think that he would like to journey there.
Brokenear didn’t hide his leadership ambitions, telling Bushytail at length about how he was going to find a clowder and challenge for leadership. He plied the toms from River Clowder and Tree Clowder with questions, clearly seeking information that would help him best choose where to make a challenge.
Bushytail’s companions taught him how to hunt cooperatively; a concept with which he was wholly unfamiliar if indeed it had ever been done before in catkind history. With more than one cat hunting the same prey, one or more cats could flush out the prey and direct it into the waiting paws at the designated place. In addition, being clowderless, the toms had no kits or elderly for which to provide, resulting in an abundance of food the likes of which Bushytail had never experienced.
Despite the ease of this lifestyle, Bushytail still felt discontent. He had always imagined that nothing could be more important than a full belly. Indeed, when one was hungry, there was little consideration of anything else, but once this goal had been achieved, the soul still hungered. While he had companionship, it wasn’t the same as having family and clowder. There were no she-cats here and no kits. Nevertheless, he was in no hurry to forgo the convenience of his current situation and pushed down his feelings of unease.
In the evenings, they generally sat together, sharing the day’s hunt and exchanging stories.
Squat and Claws weren’t far from the lands where they had been born and were the least worried about their rogue status in their clowder. It was usual for young toms to go off on their own for a while when they were young and see the world. The pair were fast friends and had a carefree attitude, which made them very good company.
On the occasions when Bushytail did join the pair for hunting, the three companions had great fun with mock battles, delighting in surprising one another or putting obstacles in one another’s paths, and laughing with good humour when one of their pranks resulted in someone losing their balance. Bushytail had parted with his siblings when he was very young and revelled in the frivolity of these young companions.
True to his name, Watcher didn’t contribute overly to the evening’s conversations. He had left Tree Clowder due to his small size, which prevented him from fulfilling hunting duties as well as other cats, and he had no plans to reclaim a clowder for himself. Of all the toms in the company, he was the only member resigned to remaining an ‘outsider’.
As the others circled to converse, Watcher did indeed cut a forlorn figure, and as such, Bushytail was drawn to him. He felt a need to protect him and help him find a way to overcome his difficulties. He spent many hours at his side in silence, comforting merely with his presence. Slowly but surely, a bond grew between them, and the shy little tom looked upon Bushytail with adoring eyes whenever he appeared. Watcher took to following Bushytail around camp, trying to anticipate his needs and bringing him the best cuts of meat: all for a little kindness.
Bristle remained as much of a mystery as ever. He often sat alone at the lookout point, seemingly staring at nothing. He was always courteous but was never warm to his companions. He would give them advice about where to look for prey when the hunting was difficult, or on occasion interject in an argument when tempers became frayed, but he didn’t give much away about himself.
Nevertheless, Bushytail couldn’t help but admire Bristle’s composure. He seemed to have no need for the company or the hunting skills of his companions, as he was a masterful hunter. Indeed, Bushytail wondered why Bristle remained with the rag-tag little company. When Bushytail pressed him for answers, Bristle simply told him that he had a purpose, and he had no choice but to follow the path laid out for him. This answer, however, didn’t satisfy Bushytail at all.
Brokenear, on the other hand, was happy to answer Bushytail’s questions.
‘When do you think you will set out to find a clowder, Brokenear? Surely you are strong enough now to take on any challenger?’ Bushytail questioned.
‘There is more to being a leader than just being strong. I certainly don’t intend to be fighting constant battles to keep my leadership. If we can work together to make our life easier, surely a clowder could also? I think I can use the things we have learnt hunting together to make a clowder stronger.’
Bushytail was intrigued.
By the end of spring, Bushytail was at peak fitness. He was no longer lean, his elongated frame having been built up with muscle. The playfights with Squat and Claws, combined with the daily traversing of the high-country terrain, had ensured that his days of leisure didn’t overly impact his physical abilities in a negative way. His coat was shiny, glossy and well groomed. He felt that there was nothing he couldn’t accomplish. He took to roaming the perimeter of the camp by himself of a morning and evening, gazing at the vista, and wondering what lay beyond. Watcher would sometimes accompany him. The quiet and unobtrusive nature of his companion suited his mood, and Watcher seemed to appreciate Bushytail’s need for companionship.
At times, Bushytail found himself telling Watcher things he had never told any other cat, almost as if he was talking to himself. He told him of his siblings and his mother, and the stress of being hungry and cold. He told him of his longing to find a mate and to be part of a clowder where he would protect elders and kits. He told him of his adventures and hopes and dreams, and in doing so, perhaps began to understand himself a little better, growing in wisdom as well as stature. As time went by, it was rare for the two to be apart, the symbiotic relationship being beneficial to both parties as they gained strength and healed.
On occasions, the pair was joined by Bristle. He too seemed to take comfort in silence as they sat on the peak of the mountain with the late evening sun blanketing them with its soft diffused light and the gentle breeze blowing on their faces. Squat and Claws had told Bushytail that they found the sight of the three statues silhouetted against the sky amusing and that they had no idea what possible solace a cat found in this absurd activity. The only time Squat and Claws would stay still was to stalk prey, and then only for as long as was absolutely necessary.
Nevertheless, Bushytail valued the diversity of his companions and the different aspects of life that his experiences with them offered. They were an odd band, but he was growing fond of them all in different ways. The only one he was still not sure about was Brokenear. There was something about him that was unsettling.
It was the end of yet another day, and the disparate members of the company were enjoying the rewards of a good day’s hunting. They had eaten well and were stretching and grooming themselves as the sun set.
Unusually, it was Watcher who began the conversation this evening. ‘There’s been a strange smell on the air these past few days. It’s like the smell of the noisy machines has become stronger. Have you smelt it?’
‘Don’t be ridiculous!’ mocked Brokenear. ‘You jump at the sight of your own shadow. There are no pathways here large enough for the noisy machines. It is your imagination playing tricks on you, my worthless excuse for a hunting partner.’
Bushytail was naturally protective of his new-found friend. How dare you speak to him like that, he thought, but before he had a chance to leap to Watcher’s defence, Bristle interjected.
‘Nay, Watcher sees what is. It is true. The humans are drawing near. You would do well to heed our observant friend.’
‘I am not scared of humans,’ boasted Brokenear. ‘Many of them passed me every day when I was a kit, without even noticing me. They pose no danger.’
Squat and Claws declared that they had had no interactions with humans, and they weren’t sure who to believe about the possible threat.
‘Tree Clowder is closer to the humans than River Clowder,’ explained Watcher. ‘I know stories about humans that would make even Brokenear’s hair curl.’
‘Pah!’ Brokenear spat. ‘Why should we listen to someone as worthless as you? No one wants you. I suggest you grow a backbone.’
At this point in the conversation, Bushytail had the distinct feeling (and not for the last time) that he didn’t like Brokenear. He motioned to Watcher to leave the group, and they walked away without responding to the taunt.
Rather than dwell on it, Bushytail decided to query Watcher further about the humans.
‘How close are they?’ he asked. ‘Do you think they could come onto our territory?’
‘They can do anything they like,’ replied Watcher with sincerity. ‘They aren’t rational creatures. They don’t seek land or prey; they just rampage at will. Please, Bushytail, take my advice and steer well clear of them.’
‘I will, my friend, I promise. I will.’
By the time they made their way back to camp it was very late, and Bushytail went straight to his den. Watcher, however, sat up a while longer, standing guard not far away from where Bushytail slept.
Many hours later, when the sun began to rise, Bushytail found Watcher still at his post.
‘Have you slept? Is the danger so great that we must post a constant guard?’ Bushytail asked.
‘I slept,’ came the reply. ‘We might not need a constant guard, but we should definitely be on guard.’
They stayed close that day, but when nothing happened, they relaxed and thought that perhaps, after all, they were mistaken.
Chapter Three:
Prudence is the Greater
Part of Valour
Bushytail was in a hunting party with Squat and Claws. He was larger than many cats, but still able to move soundlessly when needed. He had become accustomed to hunting with others. Typically, Squat and Claws would flush out the prey and Bushytail would launch the attack. Food was becoming less easy to find, but today they were lucky. Two rabbits darted out, and as quick as a flash, Bushytail was after one.
Success in catching rabbits lay in the element of surprise, as cats were no match for rabbits in an open race. This one might have got away, except for the help of his companions. Being skittish creatures, the rabbits practically jumped into Bushytail’s paws when the other two cats appeared. As the cats who made the kill, it was acceptable that they ate the choice parts of the rabbits first and then took the rest back for the others. Between the three of them the meat was soon divided into manageable parts that could be carried in their mouths.
Watcher and Brokenear had also had success hunting, bringing a snake back to camp. As the weather was turning colder, the snakes were often found soaking up the sunshine on rocks.
As always when hunting had been good, spirits were high, but there was still an air of discontent in the group. Life had been easy over the summer, and they all felt safe and secure, but the main reason for a tom to grow strong was to fight and win territory. All of them clearly felt the urge to move on and find a mate. Even Watcher was looking fit and rested after the bountiful summer.
Bushytail had silently resolved to travel south in the spring. He intended to find a clowder and hopefully a mate. It was true that he was large and strong, but he had other advantages that he considered more important. There were many large, strong cats who sought to join a clowder, but he had discovered that winning respect and fostering cooperation also went a long way to ensuring success.
That night, each tom eventually made his way to his own den, curling into a tight ball against the oncoming chill of the night. It seemed the milder weather had come to an abrupt end, as sometimes happens in the high country, with no warning as to the gradual changing of the seasons.
And as abruptly as the weather changed, so did the pattern of their reasonably uneventful lives.
Bushytail shivered through the night and woke early, deciding he needed to move to warm up. As he headed to the entrance of his den, he saw the strangest sight. Everything was white, covered by ice falling from the sky. He had never seen anything like it before. Tentatively, he reached out a paw. The white powder coating everything was soft and cold to touch.
As he stepped out, he beheld with wonder the delicate patterns in the powder on his fur. He took a few nervous steps, noticing the tracks he left behind. He would have to be careful with his footing, but the white covering was not deep. With excitement and trepidation, he set out, slipping and sliding as he went, making his way slowly and carefully along the track.
The appearance of the white covering of ice reminded him how little he had seen of the world and the great many things he might yet experience. It was nice to be out in the silence walking alone once again. The surrounding whiteness gave him a sense of isolation, peacefulness and quietness, while at the same time the falling flakes that swirled around heightened his sense of excitement and expectation.
He sniffed the air. The smell of the noisy machines was very strong here.
Drawn to continue, he crawled along until he came to a clearing that was bordered by an enormous rockface on the opposite side. In the clearing sat four humans around a circle of rocks, and from the rocks sprang red tongues leaping higher with every gust of wind. The humans huddled close to the circle. They were making loud noises: talking, laughing and drinking. They seemed to have constructed some shelters nearby, and they had a noisy machine with them, although it wasn’t turned on. Bushytail had had no idea that a noisy machine could leave its pathway, and the thought filled him with fear, but he was still curious to go closer.
Watcher had warned him not to go near the humans, but Brokenear had said that they were not so bad. They certainly didn’t seem threatening; they were obviously having a good time, joking and laughing. He had observed humans from a distance before, when they were making the structure over the noisy machine pathway, but he had never dared to go close to them. In his own mind, he justified his decision to creep further forward by telling himself that he needed to know more about them firsthand instead of relying on the accounts told to him by others. Slowly, he crept from shadow to shadow, until he could smell the food they were eating.
It was exhilarating being so close. He watched them in fascination, drawing ever closer. Then he saw Watcher. He crouched undetected just outside the circle of light that emanated from the gathering. A feeling of dread crept over Bushytail again, but he firmly pushed it down. He was no coward. He resolved not to be scared just by the mere sight of humans. If Watcher could get close enough to watch them, so could he.
He could see Watcher’s eyes fixed on him, urging him to retreat.
No doubt, the little tom had been scouting in order to warn him. Bushytail felt indignant that his friend should consider him so helpless that he needed protection, and he was determined to show his bravery. Watcher again attempted to signal to Bushytail to go away, with wilder and wilder gestures.
Perhaps thinking that Bushytail hadn’t seen him, Watcher let out a wail.
Immediately, all four humans looked directly at Watcher, detecting his presence.
After that, everything happened quickly.
One of the humans picked up a stick and pointed it at Watcher. There was a loud bang and Watcher fell down. In a matter of seconds, he was silent, and a red stain began to spread from his small body, a stark contrast to the ground’s white covering. Watcher had achieved his goal: the wail had focused the attention of all four humans on Watcher, giving Bushytail the opportunity to escape. The humans walked towards Watcher to see what it was they had killed. There were two more loud bangs, and more laughter.

Prologue
She was exhausted, but she needed to hunt again now if her litter was to survive. She crept out of the den to begin her task as she had done so many times before.
Their den was well concealed, but now that her kits had grown, so had their voices. They were famished, the poor things, so you could hardly blame them for mewing so loudly, but little did they realise the danger in which they put themselves. Only last week a crow had carried off the youngest: she shuddered to think about it.
She knew she would have to take her chances and seek prey at the farmyard again. If she could avoid the dog, the chicks provided easy pickings.
When she finally got to the farmyard, she was in luck. The hens were out of their pen wandering around, chicks trailing after them. It was over in a trice; a flurry of feathers was all there was to show for the missing chick’s whereabouts. She hurried back with the meagre fare, eagerly awaited by her hungry offspring. Sharp little teeth ground through soft bone and cartilage, not even the extremities of the unfortunate fowl remaining unconsumed.
As she watched, her heart grew heavy. Endangering herself to provide for them conflicted with her instinct for self-preservation and yet something kept driving her to take greater and greater risks on their behalf. The almost mutually exclusive instincts constantly warred within her, each vying for dominance. Soon, she knew she would go. All she could leave them were the names she had given them — nothing more. She wondered if the little orange kit would survive on his own, given that his coat made him so visible.
Be safe, Bushytail! she thought. Nature is a cruel taskmaster.
Bushytail was always ravenous. The volumes of lizards, mice and birds he was able to catch provided subsistence sustenance only. It also took a lot of energy for Bushytail to catch his prey, resulting in a physique that was both lean and muscular.
Daily, Bushytail faced a myriad of dangers. Larger predators such as foxes were a threat, as were other feral toms, and then there was the omnipresent danger posed by humans, many of whom, for a variety of reasons, wanted to eradicate feral cats. He had cleverly camouflaged the entrance to his den in a thicket of blackberry bushes to provide a measure of security during his brief sojourns, but it paid to be vigilant at all times.
When Bushytail was a kit, he lived with his mother and siblings, but at a young age he had had to learn the solitary behaviours he now practiced. A wild mother cat couldn’t provide for herself and her kits for very long, but at least she had given him his name, derived from her remembrance of his bushy tail.
Bushytail had only briefly lamented the loss of companion­ship his family had provided, but oftentimes, when he caught the scent of other cats, he felt lonely. When he was old enough and strong enough, he would contest other toms for territory and have a family of his own, but in the meantime, he would hunt and sleep and bide his time. With each passing day he grew wilier. He became bolder in his quest for food, drawing nearer and nearer human habitation, and reaping the rich rewards these opportunities offered.
The depth of winter was no time to travel, but soon, he would have to leave these lands and find his own territory.
Chapter One:
A New Beginning
Bushytail felt strong and confident. Spring was in the air and the privations of winter almost a memory. His belly was full and the sun warm as he stretched out his limbs. He looked around at the scrubby country that was his home. The trees were low and stunted, allowing the plants underneath to flourish. There were any number of strappy plants and ferns and the occasional grasstree. It looked more lovely to him than it had for some time, and he felt a pang of regret that he may not see it again.
It was easy to live in the moment at times like this, but Bushytail knew that it wasn’t time for rest and relaxation. All winter he had been plagued by hunger and the threat of attack from other toms and now it was time to move on. The warmer months were better for travelling, as he would be able to find food more easily on his journey and the need for shelter wasn’t as great. Besides which, he was looking forward to the adventure.
Living as an outsider in someone else’s territory was simply existence, not living. He wanted to be the master of his own domain, with a family and a clowder. Apart from the lack of space here for the growing population of feral cats, there was also the problem that this land was increasingly home to more and more humans. They were exceedingly dangerous, and he wanted to be as far away from them as possible.
Starting out, however, wasn’t as easy as it sounded. The reason no one ever left was that this territory was surrounded by obstacles: the farmland on one side, an expansive concrete river on the other, and on the third an enormous pathway for the smelly machines.
Bushytail had been considering which direction to take for days.
The concrete river seemed the least dangerous, but it was very strange. It had slippery sides that made it impossible to get a paw-grip. From time to time some unfortunates had fallen in by mistake and none had returned. The farmland was good for a daring cat, as there was easy food to be found; however, that was the direction from which all the humans seemed to come, and Bushytail was sure there would be many more of them in the lands beyond. That only left the enormous pathway for the machines, and even though just as many of his kin had died there, it seemed as if it was the only option.
There was an inviting stretch of bushland on the other side of the pathway that awaited any cat who could figure out the secret of traversing the frightening obstacle. I know I can do it! Bushytail told himself.
Cats weren’t the only creatures that had attempted crossing this pathway. There were a number of kangaroos, koalas and birds lying dead along the causeway, delighting only the crows. Granted, cats may be swift, but the fast-paced machines seemed to come out of nowhere, and any contact with them was deadly. Bushytail wasn’t sure that he wanted to risk himself by relying on his speed to cross. He thought that there must be another solution to get across the pathway, and he’d spent many weeks watching and waiting.
Recently, he had noticed some humans behaving strangely. For a reason he couldn’t comprehend, they were building some kind of structure across the deadly path. It had two tall pillars on either side, connected by a long beam with cages at intervals. Inside the cages were bright things like stars flashing. The structure wasn’t large enough for humans to use as a crossing, and he wondered why they would go to the effort of making it. He had memories of his mother warning him of the dangers humans posed, and he was taking no chances. Seeking an opportunity to examine the structure more closely, he watched and waited, keeping his distance.
After the humans left one evening, he examined the structure carefully. Unfortunately, it was built out of strange materials like the river but much more slippery. Even so, Bushytail still thought it was his best escape route, and he felt confident in his strength and agility to cross to safety.
He had dreamed of escape for weeks, convincing himself that beyond lay salvation: a land that had plentiful prey, even in winter. With an optimism granted only to youth, he imagined himself accomplishing great deeds, fighting great battles and winning great victories. He wasn’t a vain cat, but it was natural for one so young to dream of great things to come. So, with this frame of mind, he decided it was time to attempt the crossing.
Today was the day. No more delays.
Bushytail approached the gantry cautiously, sniffing, but the humans were long gone, and the strange structure gave off no scent. Although it was early morning, the noisy machines that went along the path never stopped. He was determined to try his plan of crossing using the structure the humans had made. Getting up would be easier than getting down. There was an overhanging tree on this side of the road. He climbed up and prepared to spring. The large bushy feature for which he was named swished in anticipation as he attempted to balance and take flight. He landed lightly, but slipped slightly on the cold, unyielding surface. Nevertheless, he managed to keep his footing and focused on the beam in front of him.
He was distracted by the constant thrum that came from the machines and the smell emanating from them. He needed nerves of steel, so pushed any other thoughts aside to focus on the oasis on the other side. Eyes firmly forward, he relied on his natural grace as he walked a straight line no wider than a kit’s head. Although he was a skilled climber, the surface was so unstable that each time he placed his paw, there was no margin for error at all. He didn’t let himself think about the danger if he fell, and instead did what cats did best: he lived in the now. His concentration was bent entirely on the placement of his paws, excluding all else.
He didn’t at first notice the putrid stench that began to overcome him. For some reason, an enormous rumbler, much bigger than the rest, had stopped directly beneath him. On its roof, it had a pipe that spewed forth filth. Bushytail could hardly breathe and dropped to a crouch. It was much more difficult to balance in this position, and with the miasma making him weak, he feared to move forward. Self-doubt assailed him, and he began an internal dialogue of self-beration: Why do I attempt this when all others have failed? What is wrong with where I came from anyway? Bushytail knew that his chance of reaching the other side was greatly diminished without his self-belief, and so he tried to put the negative thoughts aside.
Fortunately, the enormous machine moved away, allowing him some respite, and he was able to refocus. It will pass. Focus. You can do it, he told himself. The noise of the machines that kept moving under him, however, still assailed him. Like all cats, Bushytail was proud of his sensitive hearing, but in this situation, it was extremely difficult for him to think clearly with all the noise.
Regaining his composure, he rose and continued as quickly as prudence would allow. He once again focused only on putting one paw in front of the other until he reached the pillar on the far side. By this time, he was trembling, imagining what might have happened had fate not intervened, and he felt dizzy and nauseous from inhaling the fumes.
Although he wasn’t normally scared by heights alone, in his current condition, the view from his position added to his dizziness. He shut his eyes and focused on centring his balance on the precarious perch, making the most of the brief rest this stance afforded him.
He decided to attempt the descent by dangling his back legs off the edge and trying to wrap all four paws around the pillar to slow himself. Cats usually relied on digging their claws into the surface to climb down a tree, but that wasn’t possible given the impenetrable hardness of the pole. Gracelessly, he landed at the bottom with a thud. His heart raced with elation. I’ve done it! I’m on the other side!
He was exhausted and shaking all over. His limbs felt like jelly, and he desperately needed somewhere to rest. He had no energy to go farther. The strange structure seemed to absorb the heat of the day, and right now he found its warmth comforting. He curled himself in a ball in an indentation at the base of the pillar and fell asleep immediately.
Bushytail awoke hours later to find himself huddled against an icy mass, disoriented and alone. Shaking himself awake, he assessed his situation. He had planned to begin his journey in the glorious warmth of a spring day, enjoying the new scenery stretching before him. Of course, cats often travelled at night, having excellent night vision, but most tended to be crepuscular, that is, most active at dawn and dusk. There was no food to be had in the middle of the night and no way to see what might lie further afield to give him a sign by which he might steer. Nevertheless, Bushytail felt it was best to move away from the machines and set off, trusting to luck.
His encounter over the pathway had unsettled him more than he cared to admit. His great adventure had only just begun, and due to his lack of experience and foresight, he had nearly fallen at the first hurdle. He was flighty, jumping at the small unidentified night noises and the wind whistling in his ears. After a time, his nerves settled and he began to feel reassured by the familiar smells of the bushland, its plants and creatures. The night sky was clear and the air crisp and invigorating. The strength had returned to his muscles, and he revelled in the feel of them moving in unison to propel him.
Shortly, however, his thoughts turned to water, and he realised that he did, in fact, have a raging thirst and a sore throat, probably on account of the foul air he had inhaled. He headed downhill, reasoning that that would be his best chance of finding a water source. It wasn’t long before he could hear the familiar sounds telling him that a watercourse was indeed nearby, but being experienced in such matters, he didn’t rush in to drink without looking, knowing that water attracted all kinds of other creatures.
The moon emerged briefly from a grey coat for just long enough for him to see that he had reached a wide bend in the river, which appeared almost as a lake, surrounded by impressive rotund river gums. The moonlight shimmered on its surface invitingly and he approached carefully, using all of his senses to confirm that the coast was clear. When he was sure that there was no scent of other cats or humans nearby, he crouched and lapped the water greedily.
Sated, he moved soundlessly into the understory and surveyed the scene. As he sat there, he took in the beauty of the country in which he found himself. Beyond the watery vista towered tall mountains, reflected perfectly in the pond’s surface. The plants were all ones he knew, but the trees had become taller, shooting so far into the sky that he couldn’t see their tops. It was a big country and a big sky, and he suddenly felt very small.
He searched for somewhere safe to rest for what was left of the night. Lone toms were vulnerable when sleeping and finding a temporary place to rest for an evening was an undertaking that required careful consideration. Bushytail had unusual colouring, light fur with an orange tinge, which stood out in the mute colours of the bushland, and therefore he had to take care that he was well hidden. Thorn bushes often provided good cover, but a cat had to be careful that they weren’t already occupied.
Being extra cautious, Bushytail opted to climb a tree. This wasn’t the usual preferred sleeping place for a cat, but Bushytail had excellent balance and, as this was unknown territory, considered it the safest option. Being lean, he was able to climb up a good way and still find strong boughs to support him. Although the tree didn’t do much to provide camouflage, from experience he knew that predators rarely looked up: particularly humans.
As the tree branches gently swayed, lulling him towards sleep, he finally had a chance to reflect on his success. He had taken a huge risk today crossing the path of the noisy machines. It was the first time in his short life that he had done anything so daring. In fact, as he was a very young tom, he had really not done much yet other than avoid danger, hunt and find safe places to sleep.
He had been vaguely excited by the idea of what might be awaiting him in the vast bushland, but he hadn’t really given much thought as to what to do once he got here or what possible dangers he might face. He decided that he needed more information and made up his mind to go looking for it tomorrow. Are there cats nearby? Humans? What dangers will I encounter? He was keen to test his strength against another tom in a real fight, but he had no desire to seriously injure any cat in the process. His exhaustion eventually outweighed his curiosity, and he continued his meandering thoughts through the pathways of his dreams, the sensations only serving to heighten his desire.
He woke with a longing to start his adventure.
Chapter Two:
Well Met, Stranger
Dawn was fast approaching, heralded by the onset of the early carollers. With interest, Bushytail observed the world awakening and in particular the many birds seeking the water source. As tempting as it was to make a sudden lunge in an attempt to catch one, he held still, waiting for the right moment, only to find another cat easily as big as himself make the catch gracefully, mid-air, avoiding the treacherous slide into the river. However, Bushytail remained still, hoping to stay unseen to give him time to weigh up his options.
He then decided that attack was the best form of defence and reasoned that catching this unknown cat off-guard while he was absorbed with his prey would give Bushytail the advantage. The other cat was heading his way and would pass directly beneath him. All he had to do was wait for the right moment to strike. He planned to spring onto his opponent’s back, sharp claws digging in, and teeth latched on. He knew that it would be difficult to dislodge him from this position; the effort would be sure to tire his adversary.
Inexplicably, however, he went sailing through the air, missing his target altogether. He landed awkwardly, making an horrendous noise: his presence announced to all and sundry. To his surprise, the cat didn’t press his advantage, instead asking him a question.
‘Who are you?’ the stranger asked him.
Bushytail knew that this could just be a tactic to buy time, but he found himself responding anyway. ‘I’m an outsider. I walk alone.’
‘Stranger, I am no threat to you. Walk on by,’ came the response. There was no sense of fear or anxiety in the voice. The strange cat exuded confidence and calmness.
‘Stranger I may be, but not so green as to turn my back to you,’ replied Bushytail.
‘Then let me,’ said the stranger, and he turned and walked away.
The strange cat could have done nothing that would have surprised him more greatly. Were all the rules changed in this country that toms would simply let one another pass? How did I miss my opponent in the first place? Although he was inexperienced in fighting, he knew his reflexes were good and that his blow should have found its mark. The stranger had not even paused to retrieve the prey he had caught.
Warily, Bushytail eyed the fallen prey. He maintained his crouch for a full five minutes, using all his senses to detect the return of the hunter who had felled the prize, but eventually hunger won out and he devoured the creature rapidly. The feeling of a full belly quickly dispelled the uneasiness he had been experiencing. The sun was warm, but not too hot, and the temptation to bask was great, but he knew that while the sun was high, he needed to find a vantage point from which to get his bearings.
So, he started travelling uphill.
It wasn’t difficult terrain, but being out of his known territory, he flitted from tree to tree and the journey took much longer than it might have ordinarily. By the time he reached the summit, his muscles ached. Licking his paws, he looked out to behold the most amazing sight he had ever seen: a sea of trees as far as the eye could see. He had never imagined such an oasis existed. Surely there would be room in this vast tract of land for him. Bushytail was startled out of his wonder by a familiar voice.
‘Well met, stranger.’
He couldn’t believe his incaution. The tom must have tracked him and now came on him unawares.
‘Why have you followed me?’ demanded Bushytail.
‘Nay, stranger, I did not follow you,’ came the cryptic reply.
To his dismay, Bushytail saw that he was now surrounded by a motley-looking crew of toms. From the wide variety of markings they bore, they didn’t appear to be a clowder. It was very unusual for toms to work together, and he cursed his luck that he had stumbled upon a group that looked to have a unified purpose.
‘It seems that you have, albeit unknowingly, stumbled upon our stronghold. As you know, stray toms are often shunned by clowders, and existing as a loner can be dangerous. We decided our best chance of survival was to band together, and this rocky outcrop is the place we call home. You are in our territory now.’
‘Safety in numbers, you say? I can’t argue with that, given the position I’m in! What do you intend to do?’ Bushytail inquired.
‘That depends on you. The choice is yours: go or stay.’
Bushytail quickly considered his options. He didn’t want to give up his quest so quickly, but he needed knowledge of this new land, and perhaps this strange band of misfits could supply him with that knowledge. ‘Thank you,’ he replied, ‘as strange as your offer is, I believe I could use your help and you mine. I will stay.’
‘Well chosen,’ came the reply.
In turn, the cats introduced themselves. In the manner of their kind, all had names that referred to their physical attributes: Bristle, Claws, Squat and Brokenear. All except one, the smallest tom, who went by the name of Watcher. Although they banded together when necessary, they still preferred solitude, and each had their own den with its own entrance in the pile of rocks and brambles. The plateau provided a natural defence, as it was easy to see anyone or anything approaching. They shared hunting duties in order for someone to always maintain a watch. They even offered to hunt for Bushytail while he made a den for himself. He was glad to accept the offer and have a safe place to sleep for the night, as he had still not fully recovered from the effects of the foul air that he had inhaled on the gantry. He spent the day making a hollow indentation, well protected by rocks and thorn bushes and lined with dry grasses.
When dusk fell, the hunters returned. Birds were abundant in these highlands and there was plenty for all. Bushytail explained to his companions that the small territory from which he had come was getting smaller each day due to the arrival of more humans. They marvelled that he had passed over the noisy machines. One of the reasons they had their outpost here was that it was so close to the concrete pathway that others feared to come near.
They told him that there were two big clowders in this area: River Clowder and Tree Clowder. Last spring had been kind and many kits were born, but with the onset of winter, there were too many mouths to feed, and some of the older toms had to leave. Squat and Claws were from River Clowder, and Watcher was from Tree Clowder. Brokenear was from a place far to the east, filled with humans. Bristle was their leader, as he had arrived first and, as Bushytail had already noted, had an air of confidence that compelled others to do his bidding. Bristle didn’t say from which direction he had travelled.
As the days passed and Bushytail settled into a routine in his new life, he found that he very much enjoyed the companion­ship he was experiencing for the first time. Toms were solitary creatures, but with that also came deprivation and hardship. The mild spring weather combined with the reduced need to hunt resulted in ample leisure time, which was generally spent with his companions, and the young cats, having no responsibilities, frolicked and generally wasted their time — and relished doing so. Never before had Bushytail been carefree, and he was grateful for the humour his new companions provided.
Squat and Claws usually hunted together, as did Brokenear and Watcher, while Bristle kept watch. Brokenear, however, often complained loudly about the ineptitude of his partner, so Bushytail most often joined this pair, as much as to lend support to the little fellow as to help to equal the amount of prey brought in by the other party. During these long periods where they hunted together, Bushytail came to know his companions well.
Brokenear was continually haughty, with an overblown sense of entitlement. Bushytail got the feeling that Brokenear thought the others well beneath him. Brokenear told tales of wonder about the place he had left as a kit. There were thousands of humans, and all the surfaces were hard like the noisy machine path and the strange river. There were houses taller than trees. Brokenear was born on the streets of this place, but he said there were some cats who lived with the humans and let the humans touch them! Bushytail didn’t think that he would like to journey there.
Brokenear didn’t hide his leadership ambitions, telling Bushytail at length about how he was going to find a clowder and challenge for leadership. He plied the toms from River Clowder and Tree Clowder with questions, clearly seeking information that would help him best choose where to make a challenge.
Bushytail’s companions taught him how to hunt cooperatively; a concept with which he was wholly unfamiliar if indeed it had ever been done before in catkind history. With more than one cat hunting the same prey, one or more cats could flush out the prey and direct it into the waiting paws at the designated place. In addition, being clowderless, the toms had no kits or elderly for which to provide, resulting in an abundance of food the likes of which Bushytail had never experienced.
Despite the ease of this lifestyle, Bushytail still felt discontent. He had always imagined that nothing could be more important than a full belly. Indeed, when one was hungry, there was little consideration of anything else, but once this goal had been achieved, the soul still hungered. While he had companionship, it wasn’t the same as having family and clowder. There were no she-cats here and no kits. Nevertheless, he was in no hurry to forgo the convenience of his current situation and pushed down his feelings of unease.
In the evenings, they generally sat together, sharing the day’s hunt and exchanging stories.
Squat and Claws weren’t far from the lands where they had been born and were the least worried about their rogue status in their clowder. It was usual for young toms to go off on their own for a while when they were young and see the world. The pair were fast friends and had a carefree attitude, which made them very good company.
On the occasions when Bushytail did join the pair for hunting, the three companions had great fun with mock battles, delighting in surprising one another or putting obstacles in one another’s paths, and laughing with good humour when one of their pranks resulted in someone losing their balance. Bushytail had parted with his siblings when he was very young and revelled in the frivolity of these young companions.
True to his name, Watcher didn’t contribute overly to the evening’s conversations. He had left Tree Clowder due to his small size, which prevented him from fulfilling hunting duties as well as other cats, and he had no plans to reclaim a clowder for himself. Of all the toms in the company, he was the only member resigned to remaining an ‘outsider’.
As the others circled to converse, Watcher did indeed cut a forlorn figure, and as such, Bushytail was drawn to him. He felt a need to protect him and help him find a way to overcome his difficulties. He spent many hours at his side in silence, comforting merely with his presence. Slowly but surely, a bond grew between them, and the shy little tom looked upon Bushytail with adoring eyes whenever he appeared. Watcher took to following Bushytail around camp, trying to anticipate his needs and bringing him the best cuts of meat: all for a little kindness.
Bristle remained as much of a mystery as ever. He often sat alone at the lookout point, seemingly staring at nothing. He was always courteous but was never warm to his companions. He would give them advice about where to look for prey when the hunting was difficult, or on occasion interject in an argument when tempers became frayed, but he didn’t give much away about himself.
Nevertheless, Bushytail couldn’t help but admire Bristle’s composure. He seemed to have no need for the company or the hunting skills of his companions, as he was a masterful hunter. Indeed, Bushytail wondered why Bristle remained with the rag-tag little company. When Bushytail pressed him for answers, Bristle simply told him that he had a purpose, and he had no choice but to follow the path laid out for him. This answer, however, didn’t satisfy Bushytail at all.
Brokenear, on the other hand, was happy to answer Bushytail’s questions.
‘When do you think you will set out to find a clowder, Brokenear? Surely you are strong enough now to take on any challenger?’ Bushytail questioned.
‘There is more to being a leader than just being strong. I certainly don’t intend to be fighting constant battles to keep my leadership. If we can work together to make our life easier, surely a clowder could also? I think I can use the things we have learnt hunting together to make a clowder stronger.’
Bushytail was intrigued.
By the end of spring, Bushytail was at peak fitness. He was no longer lean, his elongated frame having been built up with muscle. The playfights with Squat and Claws, combined with the daily traversing of the high-country terrain, had ensured that his days of leisure didn’t overly impact his physical abilities in a negative way. His coat was shiny, glossy and well groomed. He felt that there was nothing he couldn’t accomplish. He took to roaming the perimeter of the camp by himself of a morning and evening, gazing at the vista, and wondering what lay beyond. Watcher would sometimes accompany him. The quiet and unobtrusive nature of his companion suited his mood, and Watcher seemed to appreciate Bushytail’s need for companionship.
At times, Bushytail found himself telling Watcher things he had never told any other cat, almost as if he was talking to himself. He told him of his siblings and his mother, and the stress of being hungry and cold. He told him of his longing to find a mate and to be part of a clowder where he would protect elders and kits. He told him of his adventures and hopes and dreams, and in doing so, perhaps began to understand himself a little better, growing in wisdom as well as stature. As time went by, it was rare for the two to be apart, the symbiotic relationship being beneficial to both parties as they gained strength and healed.
On occasions, the pair was joined by Bristle. He too seemed to take comfort in silence as they sat on the peak of the mountain with the late evening sun blanketing them with its soft diffused light and the gentle breeze blowing on their faces. Squat and Claws had told Bushytail that they found the sight of the three statues silhouetted against the sky amusing and that they had no idea what possible solace a cat found in this absurd activity. The only time Squat and Claws would stay still was to stalk prey, and then only for as long as was absolutely necessary.
Nevertheless, Bushytail valued the diversity of his companions and the different aspects of life that his experiences with them offered. They were an odd band, but he was growing fond of them all in different ways. The only one he was still not sure about was Brokenear. There was something about him that was unsettling.
It was the end of yet another day, and the disparate members of the company were enjoying the rewards of a good day’s hunting. They had eaten well and were stretching and grooming themselves as the sun set.
Unusually, it was Watcher who began the conversation this evening. ‘There’s been a strange smell on the air these past few days. It’s like the smell of the noisy machines has become stronger. Have you smelt it?’
‘Don’t be ridiculous!’ mocked Brokenear. ‘You jump at the sight of your own shadow. There are no pathways here large enough for the noisy machines. It is your imagination playing tricks on you, my worthless excuse for a hunting partner.’
Bushytail was naturally protective of his new-found friend. How dare you speak to him like that, he thought, but before he had a chance to leap to Watcher’s defence, Bristle interjected.
‘Nay, Watcher sees what is. It is true. The humans are drawing near. You would do well to heed our observant friend.’
‘I am not scared of humans,’ boasted Brokenear. ‘Many of them passed me every day when I was a kit, without even noticing me. They pose no danger.’
Squat and Claws declared that they had had no interactions with humans, and they weren’t sure who to believe about the possible threat.
‘Tree Clowder is closer to the humans than River Clowder,’ explained Watcher. ‘I know stories about humans that would make even Brokenear’s hair curl.’
‘Pah!’ Brokenear spat. ‘Why should we listen to someone as worthless as you? No one wants you. I suggest you grow a backbone.’
At this point in the conversation, Bushytail had the distinct feeling (and not for the last time) that he didn’t like Brokenear. He motioned to Watcher to leave the group, and they walked away without responding to the taunt.
Rather than dwell on it, Bushytail decided to query Watcher further about the humans.
‘How close are they?’ he asked. ‘Do you think they could come onto our territory?’
‘They can do anything they like,’ replied Watcher with sincerity. ‘They aren’t rational creatures. They don’t seek land or prey; they just rampage at will. Please, Bushytail, take my advice and steer well clear of them.’
‘I will, my friend, I promise. I will.’
By the time they made their way back to camp it was very late, and Bushytail went straight to his den. Watcher, however, sat up a while longer, standing guard not far away from where Bushytail slept.
Many hours later, when the sun began to rise, Bushytail found Watcher still at his post.
‘Have you slept? Is the danger so great that we must post a constant guard?’ Bushytail asked.
‘I slept,’ came the reply. ‘We might not need a constant guard, but we should definitely be on guard.’
They stayed close that day, but when nothing happened, they relaxed and thought that perhaps, after all, they were mistaken.
Chapter Three:
Prudence is the Greater
Part of Valour
Bushytail was in a hunting party with Squat and Claws. He was larger than many cats, but still able to move soundlessly when needed. He had become accustomed to hunting with others. Typically, Squat and Claws would flush out the prey and Bushytail would launch the attack. Food was becoming less easy to find, but today they were lucky. Two rabbits darted out, and as quick as a flash, Bushytail was after one.
Success in catching rabbits lay in the element of surprise, as cats were no match for rabbits in an open race. This one might have got away, except for the help of his companions. Being skittish creatures, the rabbits practically jumped into Bushytail’s paws when the other two cats appeared. As the cats who made the kill, it was acceptable that they ate the choice parts of the rabbits first and then took the rest back for the others. Between the three of them the meat was soon divided into manageable parts that could be carried in their mouths.
Watcher and Brokenear had also had success hunting, bringing a snake back to camp. As the weather was turning colder, the snakes were often found soaking up the sunshine on rocks.
As always when hunting had been good, spirits were high, but there was still an air of discontent in the group. Life had been easy over the summer, and they all felt safe and secure, but the main reason for a tom to grow strong was to fight and win territory. All of them clearly felt the urge to move on and find a mate. Even Watcher was looking fit and rested after the bountiful summer.
Bushytail had silently resolved to travel south in the spring. He intended to find a clowder and hopefully a mate. It was true that he was large and strong, but he had other advantages that he considered more important. There were many large, strong cats who sought to join a clowder, but he had discovered that winning respect and fostering cooperation also went a long way to ensuring success.
That night, each tom eventually made his way to his own den, curling into a tight ball against the oncoming chill of the night. It seemed the milder weather had come to an abrupt end, as sometimes happens in the high country, with no warning as to the gradual changing of the seasons.
And as abruptly as the weather changed, so did the pattern of their reasonably uneventful lives.
Bushytail shivered through the night and woke early, deciding he needed to move to warm up. As he headed to the entrance of his den, he saw the strangest sight. Everything was white, covered by ice falling from the sky. He had never seen anything like it before. Tentatively, he reached out a paw. The white powder coating everything was soft and cold to touch.
As he stepped out, he beheld with wonder the delicate patterns in the powder on his fur. He took a few nervous steps, noticing the tracks he left behind. He would have to be careful with his footing, but the white covering was not deep. With excitement and trepidation, he set out, slipping and sliding as he went, making his way slowly and carefully along the track.
The appearance of the white covering of ice reminded him how little he had seen of the world and the great many things he might yet experience. It was nice to be out in the silence walking alone once again. The surrounding whiteness gave him a sense of isolation, peacefulness and quietness, while at the same time the falling flakes that swirled around heightened his sense of excitement and expectation.
He sniffed the air. The smell of the noisy machines was very strong here.
Drawn to continue, he crawled along until he came to a clearing that was bordered by an enormous rockface on the opposite side. In the clearing sat four humans around a circle of rocks, and from the rocks sprang red tongues leaping higher with every gust of wind. The humans huddled close to the circle. They were making loud noises: talking, laughing and drinking. They seemed to have constructed some shelters nearby, and they had a noisy machine with them, although it wasn’t turned on. Bushytail had had no idea that a noisy machine could leave its pathway, and the thought filled him with fear, but he was still curious to go closer.
Watcher had warned him not to go near the humans, but Brokenear had said that they were not so bad. They certainly didn’t seem threatening; they were obviously having a good time, joking and laughing. He had observed humans from a distance before, when they were making the structure over the noisy machine pathway, but he had never dared to go close to them. In his own mind, he justified his decision to creep further forward by telling himself that he needed to know more about them firsthand instead of relying on the accounts told to him by others. Slowly, he crept from shadow to shadow, until he could smell the food they were eating.
It was exhilarating being so close. He watched them in fascination, drawing ever closer. Then he saw Watcher. He crouched undetected just outside the circle of light that emanated from the gathering. A feeling of dread crept over Bushytail again, but he firmly pushed it down. He was no coward. He resolved not to be scared just by the mere sight of humans. If Watcher could get close enough to watch them, so could he.
He could see Watcher’s eyes fixed on him, urging him to retreat.
No doubt, the little tom had been scouting in order to warn him. Bushytail felt indignant that his friend should consider him so helpless that he needed protection, and he was determined to show his bravery. Watcher again attempted to signal to Bushytail to go away, with wilder and wilder gestures.
Perhaps thinking that Bushytail hadn’t seen him, Watcher let out a wail.
Immediately, all four humans looked directly at Watcher, detecting his presence.
After that, everything happened quickly.
One of the humans picked up a stick and pointed it at Watcher. There was a loud bang and Watcher fell down. In a matter of seconds, he was silent, and a red stain began to spread from his small body, a stark contrast to the ground’s white covering. Watcher had achieved his goal: the wail had focused the attention of all four humans on Watcher, giving Bushytail the opportunity to escape. The humans walked towards Watcher to see what it was they had killed. There were two more loud bangs, and more laughter.

Prologue
She was exhausted, but she needed to hunt again now if her litter was to survive. She crept out of the den to begin her task as she had done so many times before.
Their den was well concealed, but now that her kits had grown, so had their voices. They were famished, the poor things, so you could hardly blame them for mewing so loudly, but little did they realise the danger in which they put themselves. Only last week a crow had carried off the youngest: she shuddered to think about it.
She knew she would have to take her chances and seek prey at the farmyard again. If she could avoid the dog, the chicks provided easy pickings.
When she finally got to the farmyard, she was in luck. The hens were out of their pen wandering around, chicks trailing after them. It was over in a trice; a flurry of feathers was all there was to show for the missing chick’s whereabouts. She hurried back with the meagre fare, eagerly awaited by her hungry offspring. Sharp little teeth ground through soft bone and cartilage, not even the extremities of the unfortunate fowl remaining unconsumed.
As she watched, her heart grew heavy. Endangering herself to provide for them conflicted with her instinct for self-preservation and yet something kept driving her to take greater and greater risks on their behalf. The almost mutually exclusive instincts constantly warred within her, each vying for dominance. Soon, she knew she would go. All she could leave them were the names she had given them — nothing more. She wondered if the little orange kit would survive on his own, given that his coat made him so visible.
Be safe, Bushytail! she thought. Nature is a cruel taskmaster.
Bushytail was always ravenous. The volumes of lizards, mice and birds he was able to catch provided subsistence sustenance only. It also took a lot of energy for Bushytail to catch his prey, resulting in a physique that was both lean and muscular.
Daily, Bushytail faced a myriad of dangers. Larger predators such as foxes were a threat, as were other feral toms, and then there was the omnipresent danger posed by humans, many of whom, for a variety of reasons, wanted to eradicate feral cats. He had cleverly camouflaged the entrance to his den in a thicket of blackberry bushes to provide a measure of security during his brief sojourns, but it paid to be vigilant at all times.
When Bushytail was a kit, he lived with his mother and siblings, but at a young age he had had to learn the solitary behaviours he now practiced. A wild mother cat couldn’t provide for herself and her kits for very long, but at least she had given him his name, derived from her remembrance of his bushy tail.
Bushytail had only briefly lamented the loss of companion­ship his family had provided, but oftentimes, when he caught the scent of other cats, he felt lonely. When he was old enough and strong enough, he would contest other toms for territory and have a family of his own, but in the meantime, he would hunt and sleep and bide his time. With each passing day he grew wilier. He became bolder in his quest for food, drawing nearer and nearer human habitation, and reaping the rich rewards these opportunities offered.
The depth of winter was no time to travel, but soon, he would have to leave these lands and find his own territory.
Chapter One:
A New Beginning
Bushytail felt strong and confident. Spring was in the air and the privations of winter almost a memory. His belly was full and the sun warm as he stretched out his limbs. He looked around at the scrubby country that was his home. The trees were low and stunted, allowing the plants underneath to flourish. There were any number of strappy plants and ferns and the occasional grasstree. It looked more lovely to him than it had for some time, and he felt a pang of regret that he may not see it again.
It was easy to live in the moment at times like this, but Bushytail knew that it wasn’t time for rest and relaxation. All winter he had been plagued by hunger and the threat of attack from other toms and now it was time to move on. The warmer months were better for travelling, as he would be able to find food more easily on his journey and the need for shelter wasn’t as great. Besides which, he was looking forward to the adventure.
Living as an outsider in someone else’s territory was simply existence, not living. He wanted to be the master of his own domain, with a family and a clowder. Apart from the lack of space here for the growing population of feral cats, there was also the problem that this land was increasingly home to more and more humans. They were exceedingly dangerous, and he wanted to be as far away from them as possible.
Starting out, however, wasn’t as easy as it sounded. The reason no one ever left was that this territory was surrounded by obstacles: the farmland on one side, an expansive concrete river on the other, and on the third an enormous pathway for the smelly machines.
Bushytail had been considering which direction to take for days.
The concrete river seemed the least dangerous, but it was very strange. It had slippery sides that made it impossible to get a paw-grip. From time to time some unfortunates had fallen in by mistake and none had returned. The farmland was good for a daring cat, as there was easy food to be found; however, that was the direction from which all the humans seemed to come, and Bushytail was sure there would be many more of them in the lands beyond. That only left the enormous pathway for the machines, and even though just as many of his kin had died there, it seemed as if it was the only option.
There was an inviting stretch of bushland on the other side of the pathway that awaited any cat who could figure out the secret of traversing the frightening obstacle. I know I can do it! Bushytail told himself.
Cats weren’t the only creatures that had attempted crossing this pathway. There were a number of kangaroos, koalas and birds lying dead along the causeway, delighting only the crows. Granted, cats may be swift, but the fast-paced machines seemed to come out of nowhere, and any contact with them was deadly. Bushytail wasn’t sure that he wanted to risk himself by relying on his speed to cross. He thought that there must be another solution to get across the pathway, and he’d spent many weeks watching and waiting.
Recently, he had noticed some humans behaving strangely. For a reason he couldn’t comprehend, they were building some kind of structure across the deadly path. It had two tall pillars on either side, connected by a long beam with cages at intervals. Inside the cages were bright things like stars flashing. The structure wasn’t large enough for humans to use as a crossing, and he wondered why they would go to the effort of making it. He had memories of his mother warning him of the dangers humans posed, and he was taking no chances. Seeking an opportunity to examine the structure more closely, he watched and waited, keeping his distance.
After the humans left one evening, he examined the structure carefully. Unfortunately, it was built out of strange materials like the river but much more slippery. Even so, Bushytail still thought it was his best escape route, and he felt confident in his strength and agility to cross to safety.
He had dreamed of escape for weeks, convincing himself that beyond lay salvation: a land that had plentiful prey, even in winter. With an optimism granted only to youth, he imagined himself accomplishing great deeds, fighting great battles and winning great victories. He wasn’t a vain cat, but it was natural for one so young to dream of great things to come. So, with this frame of mind, he decided it was time to attempt the crossing.
Today was the day. No more delays.
Bushytail approached the gantry cautiously, sniffing, but the humans were long gone, and the strange structure gave off no scent. Although it was early morning, the noisy machines that went along the path never stopped. He was determined to try his plan of crossing using the structure the humans had made. Getting up would be easier than getting down. There was an overhanging tree on this side of the road. He climbed up and prepared to spring. The large bushy feature for which he was named swished in anticipation as he attempted to balance and take flight. He landed lightly, but slipped slightly on the cold, unyielding surface. Nevertheless, he managed to keep his footing and focused on the beam in front of him.
He was distracted by the constant thrum that came from the machines and the smell emanating from them. He needed nerves of steel, so pushed any other thoughts aside to focus on the oasis on the other side. Eyes firmly forward, he relied on his natural grace as he walked a straight line no wider than a kit’s head. Although he was a skilled climber, the surface was so unstable that each time he placed his paw, there was no margin for error at all. He didn’t let himself think about the danger if he fell, and instead did what cats did best: he lived in the now. His concentration was bent entirely on the placement of his paws, excluding all else.
He didn’t at first notice the putrid stench that began to overcome him. For some reason, an enormous rumbler, much bigger than the rest, had stopped directly beneath him. On its roof, it had a pipe that spewed forth filth. Bushytail could hardly breathe and dropped to a crouch. It was much more difficult to balance in this position, and with the miasma making him weak, he feared to move forward. Self-doubt assailed him, and he began an internal dialogue of self-beration: Why do I attempt this when all others have failed? What is wrong with where I came from anyway? Bushytail knew that his chance of reaching the other side was greatly diminished without his self-belief, and so he tried to put the negative thoughts aside.
Fortunately, the enormous machine moved away, allowing him some respite, and he was able to refocus. It will pass. Focus. You can do it, he told himself. The noise of the machines that kept moving under him, however, still assailed him. Like all cats, Bushytail was proud of his sensitive hearing, but in this situation, it was extremely difficult for him to think clearly with all the noise.
Regaining his composure, he rose and continued as quickly as prudence would allow. He once again focused only on putting one paw in front of the other until he reached the pillar on the far side. By this time, he was trembling, imagining what might have happened had fate not intervened, and he felt dizzy and nauseous from inhaling the fumes.
Although he wasn’t normally scared by heights alone, in his current condition, the view from his position added to his dizziness. He shut his eyes and focused on centring his balance on the precarious perch, making the most of the brief rest this stance afforded him.
He decided to attempt the descent by dangling his back legs off the edge and trying to wrap all four paws around the pillar to slow himself. Cats usually relied on digging their claws into the surface to climb down a tree, but that wasn’t possible given the impenetrable hardness of the pole. Gracelessly, he landed at the bottom with a thud. His heart raced with elation. I’ve done it! I’m on the other side!
He was exhausted and shaking all over. His limbs felt like jelly, and he desperately needed somewhere to rest. He had no energy to go farther. The strange structure seemed to absorb the heat of the day, and right now he found its warmth comforting. He curled himself in a ball in an indentation at the base of the pillar and fell asleep immediately.
Bushytail awoke hours later to find himself huddled against an icy mass, disoriented and alone. Shaking himself awake, he assessed his situation. He had planned to begin his journey in the glorious warmth of a spring day, enjoying the new scenery stretching before him. Of course, cats often travelled at night, having excellent night vision, but most tended to be crepuscular, that is, most active at dawn and dusk. There was no food to be had in the middle of the night and no way to see what might lie further afield to give him a sign by which he might steer. Nevertheless, Bushytail felt it was best to move away from the machines and set off, trusting to luck.
His encounter over the pathway had unsettled him more than he cared to admit. His great adventure had only just begun, and due to his lack of experience and foresight, he had nearly fallen at the first hurdle. He was flighty, jumping at the small unidentified night noises and the wind whistling in his ears. After a time, his nerves settled and he began to feel reassured by the familiar smells of the bushland, its plants and creatures. The night sky was clear and the air crisp and invigorating. The strength had returned to his muscles, and he revelled in the feel of them moving in unison to propel him.
Shortly, however, his thoughts turned to water, and he realised that he did, in fact, have a raging thirst and a sore throat, probably on account of the foul air he had inhaled. He headed downhill, reasoning that that would be his best chance of finding a water source. It wasn’t long before he could hear the familiar sounds telling him that a watercourse was indeed nearby, but being experienced in such matters, he didn’t rush in to drink without looking, knowing that water attracted all kinds of other creatures.
The moon emerged briefly from a grey coat for just long enough for him to see that he had reached a wide bend in the river, which appeared almost as a lake, surrounded by impressive rotund river gums. The moonlight shimmered on its surface invitingly and he approached carefully, using all of his senses to confirm that the coast was clear. When he was sure that there was no scent of other cats or humans nearby, he crouched and lapped the water greedily.
Sated, he moved soundlessly into the understory and surveyed the scene. As he sat there, he took in the beauty of the country in which he found himself. Beyond the watery vista towered tall mountains, reflected perfectly in the pond’s surface. The plants were all ones he knew, but the trees had become taller, shooting so far into the sky that he couldn’t see their tops. It was a big country and a big sky, and he suddenly felt very small.
He searched for somewhere safe to rest for what was left of the night. Lone toms were vulnerable when sleeping and finding a temporary place to rest for an evening was an undertaking that required careful consideration. Bushytail had unusual colouring, light fur with an orange tinge, which stood out in the mute colours of the bushland, and therefore he had to take care that he was well hidden. Thorn bushes often provided good cover, but a cat had to be careful that they weren’t already occupied.
Being extra cautious, Bushytail opted to climb a tree. This wasn’t the usual preferred sleeping place for a cat, but Bushytail had excellent balance and, as this was unknown territory, considered it the safest option. Being lean, he was able to climb up a good way and still find strong boughs to support him. Although the tree didn’t do much to provide camouflage, from experience he knew that predators rarely looked up: particularly humans.
As the tree branches gently swayed, lulling him towards sleep, he finally had a chance to reflect on his success. He had taken a huge risk today crossing the path of the noisy machines. It was the first time in his short life that he had done anything so daring. In fact, as he was a very young tom, he had really not done much yet other than avoid danger, hunt and find safe places to sleep.
He had been vaguely excited by the idea of what might be awaiting him in the vast bushland, but he hadn’t really given much thought as to what to do once he got here or what possible dangers he might face. He decided that he needed more information and made up his mind to go looking for it tomorrow. Are there cats nearby? Humans? What dangers will I encounter? He was keen to test his strength against another tom in a real fight, but he had no desire to seriously injure any cat in the process. His exhaustion eventually outweighed his curiosity, and he continued his meandering thoughts through the pathways of his dreams, the sensations only serving to heighten his desire.
He woke with a longing to start his adventure.
Chapter Two:
Well Met, Stranger
Dawn was fast approaching, heralded by the onset of the early carollers. With interest, Bushytail observed the world awakening and in particular the many birds seeking the water source. As tempting as it was to make a sudden lunge in an attempt to catch one, he held still, waiting for the right moment, only to find another cat easily as big as himself make the catch gracefully, mid-air, avoiding the treacherous slide into the river. However, Bushytail remained still, hoping to stay unseen to give him time to weigh up his options.
He then decided that attack was the best form of defence and reasoned that catching this unknown cat off-guard while he was absorbed with his prey would give Bushytail the advantage. The other cat was heading his way and would pass directly beneath him. All he had to do was wait for the right moment to strike. He planned to spring onto his opponent’s back, sharp claws digging in, and teeth latched on. He knew that it would be difficult to dislodge him from this position; the effort would be sure to tire his adversary.
Inexplicably, however, he went sailing through the air, missing his target altogether. He landed awkwardly, making an horrendous noise: his presence announced to all and sundry. To his surprise, the cat didn’t press his advantage, instead asking him a question.
‘Who are you?’ the stranger asked him.
Bushytail knew that this could just be a tactic to buy time, but he found himself responding anyway. ‘I’m an outsider. I walk alone.’
‘Stranger, I am no threat to you. Walk on by,’ came the response. There was no sense of fear or anxiety in the voice. The strange cat exuded confidence and calmness.
‘Stranger I may be, but not so green as to turn my back to you,’ replied Bushytail.
‘Then let me,’ said the stranger, and he turned and walked away.
The strange cat could have done nothing that would have surprised him more greatly. Were all the rules changed in this country that toms would simply let one another pass? How did I miss my opponent in the first place? Although he was inexperienced in fighting, he knew his reflexes were good and that his blow should have found its mark. The stranger had not even paused to retrieve the prey he had caught.
Warily, Bushytail eyed the fallen prey. He maintained his crouch for a full five minutes, using all his senses to detect the return of the hunter who had felled the prize, but eventually hunger won out and he devoured the creature rapidly. The feeling of a full belly quickly dispelled the uneasiness he had been experiencing. The sun was warm, but not too hot, and the temptation to bask was great, but he knew that while the sun was high, he needed to find a vantage point from which to get his bearings.
So, he started travelling uphill.
It wasn’t difficult terrain, but being out of his known territory, he flitted from tree to tree and the journey took much longer than it might have ordinarily. By the time he reached the summit, his muscles ached. Licking his paws, he looked out to behold the most amazing sight he had ever seen: a sea of trees as far as the eye could see. He had never imagined such an oasis existed. Surely there would be room in this vast tract of land for him. Bushytail was startled out of his wonder by a familiar voice.
‘Well met, stranger.’
He couldn’t believe his incaution. The tom must have tracked him and now came on him unawares.
‘Why have you followed me?’ demanded Bushytail.
‘Nay, stranger, I did not follow you,’ came the cryptic reply.
To his dismay, Bushytail saw that he was now surrounded by a motley-looking crew of toms. From the wide variety of markings they bore, they didn’t appear to be a clowder. It was very unusual for toms to work together, and he cursed his luck that he had stumbled upon a group that looked to have a unified purpose.
‘It seems that you have, albeit unknowingly, stumbled upon our stronghold. As you know, stray toms are often shunned by clowders, and existing as a loner can be dangerous. We decided our best chance of survival was to band together, and this rocky outcrop is the place we call home. You are in our territory now.’
‘Safety in numbers, you say? I can’t argue with that, given the position I’m in! What do you intend to do?’ Bushytail inquired.
‘That depends on you. The choice is yours: go or stay.’
Bushytail quickly considered his options. He didn’t want to give up his quest so quickly, but he needed knowledge of this new land, and perhaps this strange band of misfits could supply him with that knowledge. ‘Thank you,’ he replied, ‘as strange as your offer is, I believe I could use your help and you mine. I will stay.’
‘Well chosen,’ came the reply.
In turn, the cats introduced themselves. In the manner of their kind, all had names that referred to their physical attributes: Bristle, Claws, Squat and Brokenear. All except one, the smallest tom, who went by the name of Watcher. Although they banded together when necessary, they still preferred solitude, and each had their own den with its own entrance in the pile of rocks and brambles. The plateau provided a natural defence, as it was easy to see anyone or anything approaching. They shared hunting duties in order for someone to always maintain a watch. They even offered to hunt for Bushytail while he made a den for himself. He was glad to accept the offer and have a safe place to sleep for the night, as he had still not fully recovered from the effects of the foul air that he had inhaled on the gantry. He spent the day making a hollow indentation, well protected by rocks and thorn bushes and lined with dry grasses.
When dusk fell, the hunters returned. Birds were abundant in these highlands and there was plenty for all. Bushytail explained to his companions that the small territory from which he had come was getting smaller each day due to the arrival of more humans. They marvelled that he had passed over the noisy machines. One of the reasons they had their outpost here was that it was so close to the concrete pathway that others feared to come near.
They told him that there were two big clowders in this area: River Clowder and Tree Clowder. Last spring had been kind and many kits were born, but with the onset of winter, there were too many mouths to feed, and some of the older toms had to leave. Squat and Claws were from River Clowder, and Watcher was from Tree Clowder. Brokenear was from a place far to the east, filled with humans. Bristle was their leader, as he had arrived first and, as Bushytail had already noted, had an air of confidence that compelled others to do his bidding. Bristle didn’t say from which direction he had travelled.
As the days passed and Bushytail settled into a routine in his new life, he found that he very much enjoyed the companion­ship he was experiencing for the first time. Toms were solitary creatures, but with that also came deprivation and hardship. The mild spring weather combined with the reduced need to hunt resulted in ample leisure time, which was generally spent with his companions, and the young cats, having no responsibilities, frolicked and generally wasted their time — and relished doing so. Never before had Bushytail been carefree, and he was grateful for the humour his new companions provided.
Squat and Claws usually hunted together, as did Brokenear and Watcher, while Bristle kept watch. Brokenear, however, often complained loudly about the ineptitude of his partner, so Bushytail most often joined this pair, as much as to lend support to the little fellow as to help to equal the amount of prey brought in by the other party. During these long periods where they hunted together, Bushytail came to know his companions well.
Brokenear was continually haughty, with an overblown sense of entitlement. Bushytail got the feeling that Brokenear thought the others well beneath him. Brokenear told tales of wonder about the place he had left as a kit. There were thousands of humans, and all the surfaces were hard like the noisy machine path and the strange river. There were houses taller than trees. Brokenear was born on the streets of this place, but he said there were some cats who lived with the humans and let the humans touch them! Bushytail didn’t think that he would like to journey there.
Brokenear didn’t hide his leadership ambitions, telling Bushytail at length about how he was going to find a clowder and challenge for leadership. He plied the toms from River Clowder and Tree Clowder with questions, clearly seeking information that would help him best choose where to make a challenge.
Bushytail’s companions taught him how to hunt cooperatively; a concept with which he was wholly unfamiliar if indeed it had ever been done before in catkind history. With more than one cat hunting the same prey, one or more cats could flush out the prey and direct it into the waiting paws at the designated place. In addition, being clowderless, the toms had no kits or elderly for which to provide, resulting in an abundance of food the likes of which Bushytail had never experienced.
Despite the ease of this lifestyle, Bushytail still felt discontent. He had always imagined that nothing could be more important than a full belly. Indeed, when one was hungry, there was little consideration of anything else, but once this goal had been achieved, the soul still hungered. While he had companionship, it wasn’t the same as having family and clowder. There were no she-cats here and no kits. Nevertheless, he was in no hurry to forgo the convenience of his current situation and pushed down his feelings of unease.
In the evenings, they generally sat together, sharing the day’s hunt and exchanging stories.
Squat and Claws weren’t far from the lands where they had been born and were the least worried about their rogue status in their clowder. It was usual for young toms to go off on their own for a while when they were young and see the world. The pair were fast friends and had a carefree attitude, which made them very good company.
On the occasions when Bushytail did join the pair for hunting, the three companions had great fun with mock battles, delighting in surprising one another or putting obstacles in one another’s paths, and laughing with good humour when one of their pranks resulted in someone losing their balance. Bushytail had parted with his siblings when he was very young and revelled in the frivolity of these young companions.
True to his name, Watcher didn’t contribute overly to the evening’s conversations. He had left Tree Clowder due to his small size, which prevented him from fulfilling hunting duties as well as other cats, and he had no plans to reclaim a clowder for himself. Of all the toms in the company, he was the only member resigned to remaining an ‘outsider’.
As the others circled to converse, Watcher did indeed cut a forlorn figure, and as such, Bushytail was drawn to him. He felt a need to protect him and help him find a way to overcome his difficulties. He spent many hours at his side in silence, comforting merely with his presence. Slowly but surely, a bond grew between them, and the shy little tom looked upon Bushytail with adoring eyes whenever he appeared. Watcher took to following Bushytail around camp, trying to anticipate his needs and bringing him the best cuts of meat: all for a little kindness.
Bristle remained as much of a mystery as ever. He often sat alone at the lookout point, seemingly staring at nothing. He was always courteous but was never warm to his companions. He would give them advice about where to look for prey when the hunting was difficult, or on occasion interject in an argument when tempers became frayed, but he didn’t give much away about himself.
Nevertheless, Bushytail couldn’t help but admire Bristle’s composure. He seemed to have no need for the company or the hunting skills of his companions, as he was a masterful hunter. Indeed, Bushytail wondered why Bristle remained with the rag-tag little company. When Bushytail pressed him for answers, Bristle simply told him that he had a purpose, and he had no choice but to follow the path laid out for him. This answer, however, didn’t satisfy Bushytail at all.
Brokenear, on the other hand, was happy to answer Bushytail’s questions.
‘When do you think you will set out to find a clowder, Brokenear? Surely you are strong enough now to take on any challenger?’ Bushytail questioned.
‘There is more to being a leader than just being strong. I certainly don’t intend to be fighting constant battles to keep my leadership. If we can work together to make our life easier, surely a clowder could also? I think I can use the things we have learnt hunting together to make a clowder stronger.’
Bushytail was intrigued.
By the end of spring, Bushytail was at peak fitness. He was no longer lean, his elongated frame having been built up with muscle. The playfights with Squat and Claws, combined with the daily traversing of the high-country terrain, had ensured that his days of leisure didn’t overly impact his physical abilities in a negative way. His coat was shiny, glossy and well groomed. He felt that there was nothing he couldn’t accomplish. He took to roaming the perimeter of the camp by himself of a morning and evening, gazing at the vista, and wondering what lay beyond. Watcher would sometimes accompany him. The quiet and unobtrusive nature of his companion suited his mood, and Watcher seemed to appreciate Bushytail’s need for companionship.
At times, Bushytail found himself telling Watcher things he had never told any other cat, almost as if he was talking to himself. He told him of his siblings and his mother, and the stress of being hungry and cold. He told him of his longing to find a mate and to be part of a clowder where he would protect elders and kits. He told him of his adventures and hopes and dreams, and in doing so, perhaps began to understand himself a little better, growing in wisdom as well as stature. As time went by, it was rare for the two to be apart, the symbiotic relationship being beneficial to both parties as they gained strength and healed.
On occasions, the pair was joined by Bristle. He too seemed to take comfort in silence as they sat on the peak of the mountain with the late evening sun blanketing them with its soft diffused light and the gentle breeze blowing on their faces. Squat and Claws had told Bushytail that they found the sight of the three statues silhouetted against the sky amusing and that they had no idea what possible solace a cat found in this absurd activity. The only time Squat and Claws would stay still was to stalk prey, and then only for as long as was absolutely necessary.
Nevertheless, Bushytail valued the diversity of his companions and the different aspects of life that his experiences with them offered. They were an odd band, but he was growing fond of them all in different ways. The only one he was still not sure about was Brokenear. There was something about him that was unsettling.
It was the end of yet another day, and the disparate members of the company were enjoying the rewards of a good day’s hunting. They had eaten well and were stretching and grooming themselves as the sun set.
Unusually, it was Watcher who began the conversation this evening. ‘There’s been a strange smell on the air these past few days. It’s like the smell of the noisy machines has become stronger. Have you smelt it?’
‘Don’t be ridiculous!’ mocked Brokenear. ‘You jump at the sight of your own shadow. There are no pathways here large enough for the noisy machines. It is your imagination playing tricks on you, my worthless excuse for a hunting partner.’
Bushytail was naturally protective of his new-found friend. How dare you speak to him like that, he thought, but before he had a chance to leap to Watcher’s defence, Bristle interjected.
‘Nay, Watcher sees what is. It is true. The humans are drawing near. You would do well to heed our observant friend.’
‘I am not scared of humans,’ boasted Brokenear. ‘Many of them passed me every day when I was a kit, without even noticing me. They pose no danger.’
Squat and Claws declared that they had had no interactions with humans, and they weren’t sure who to believe about the possible threat.
‘Tree Clowder is closer to the humans than River Clowder,’ explained Watcher. ‘I know stories about humans that would make even Brokenear’s hair curl.’
‘Pah!’ Brokenear spat. ‘Why should we listen to someone as worthless as you? No one wants you. I suggest you grow a backbone.’
At this point in the conversation, Bushytail had the distinct feeling (and not for the last time) that he didn’t like Brokenear. He motioned to Watcher to leave the group, and they walked away without responding to the taunt.
Rather than dwell on it, Bushytail decided to query Watcher further about the humans.
‘How close are they?’ he asked. ‘Do you think they could come onto our territory?’
‘They can do anything they like,’ replied Watcher with sincerity. ‘They aren’t rational creatures. They don’t seek land or prey; they just rampage at will. Please, Bushytail, take my advice and steer well clear of them.’
‘I will, my friend, I promise. I will.’
By the time they made their way back to camp it was very late, and Bushytail went straight to his den. Watcher, however, sat up a while longer, standing guard not far away from where Bushytail slept.
Many hours later, when the sun began to rise, Bushytail found Watcher still at his post.
‘Have you slept? Is the danger so great that we must post a constant guard?’ Bushytail asked.
‘I slept,’ came the reply. ‘We might not need a constant guard, but we should definitely be on guard.’
They stayed close that day, but when nothing happened, they relaxed and thought that perhaps, after all, they were mistaken.
Chapter Three:
Prudence is the Greater
Part of Valour
Bushytail was in a hunting party with Squat and Claws. He was larger than many cats, but still able to move soundlessly when needed. He had become accustomed to hunting with others. Typically, Squat and Claws would flush out the prey and Bushytail would launch the attack. Food was becoming less easy to find, but today they were lucky. Two rabbits darted out, and as quick as a flash, Bushytail was after one.
Success in catching rabbits lay in the element of surprise, as cats were no match for rabbits in an open race. This one might have got away, except for the help of his companions. Being skittish creatures, the rabbits practically jumped into Bushytail’s paws when the other two cats appeared. As the cats who made the kill, it was acceptable that they ate the choice parts of the rabbits first and then took the rest back for the others. Between the three of them the meat was soon divided into manageable parts that could be carried in their mouths.
Watcher and Brokenear had also had success hunting, bringing a snake back to camp. As the weather was turning colder, the snakes were often found soaking up the sunshine on rocks.
As always when hunting had been good, spirits were high, but there was still an air of discontent in the group. Life had been easy over the summer, and they all felt safe and secure, but the main reason for a tom to grow strong was to fight and win territory. All of them clearly felt the urge to move on and find a mate. Even Watcher was looking fit and rested after the bountiful summer.
Bushytail had silently resolved to travel south in the spring. He intended to find a clowder and hopefully a mate. It was true that he was large and strong, but he had other advantages that he considered more important. There were many large, strong cats who sought to join a clowder, but he had discovered that winning respect and fostering cooperation also went a long way to ensuring success.
That night, each tom eventually made his way to his own den, curling into a tight ball against the oncoming chill of the night. It seemed the milder weather had come to an abrupt end, as sometimes happens in the high country, with no warning as to the gradual changing of the seasons.
And as abruptly as the weather changed, so did the pattern of their reasonably uneventful lives.
Bushytail shivered through the night and woke early, deciding he needed to move to warm up. As he headed to the entrance of his den, he saw the strangest sight. Everything was white, covered by ice falling from the sky. He had never seen anything like it before. Tentatively, he reached out a paw. The white powder coating everything was soft and cold to touch.
As he stepped out, he beheld with wonder the delicate patterns in the powder on his fur. He took a few nervous steps, noticing the tracks he left behind. He would have to be careful with his footing, but the white covering was not deep. With excitement and trepidation, he set out, slipping and sliding as he went, making his way slowly and carefully along the track.
The appearance of the white covering of ice reminded him how little he had seen of the world and the great many things he might yet experience. It was nice to be out in the silence walking alone once again. The surrounding whiteness gave him a sense of isolation, peacefulness and quietness, while at the same time the falling flakes that swirled around heightened his sense of excitement and expectation.
He sniffed the air. The smell of the noisy machines was very strong here.
Drawn to continue, he crawled along until he came to a clearing that was bordered by an enormous rockface on the opposite side. In the clearing sat four humans around a circle of rocks, and from the rocks sprang red tongues leaping higher with every gust of wind. The humans huddled close to the circle. They were making loud noises: talking, laughing and drinking. They seemed to have constructed some shelters nearby, and they had a noisy machine with them, although it wasn’t turned on. Bushytail had had no idea that a noisy machine could leave its pathway, and the thought filled him with fear, but he was still curious to go closer.
Watcher had warned him not to go near the humans, but Brokenear had said that they were not so bad. They certainly didn’t seem threatening; they were obviously having a good time, joking and laughing. He had observed humans from a distance before, when they were making the structure over the noisy machine pathway, but he had never dared to go close to them. In his own mind, he justified his decision to creep further forward by telling himself that he needed to know more about them firsthand instead of relying on the accounts told to him by others. Slowly, he crept from shadow to shadow, until he could smell the food they were eating.
It was exhilarating being so close. He watched them in fascination, drawing ever closer. Then he saw Watcher. He crouched undetected just outside the circle of light that emanated from the gathering. A feeling of dread crept over Bushytail again, but he firmly pushed it down. He was no coward. He resolved not to be scared just by the mere sight of humans. If Watcher could get close enough to watch them, so could he.
He could see Watcher’s eyes fixed on him, urging him to retreat.
No doubt, the little tom had been scouting in order to warn him. Bushytail felt indignant that his friend should consider him so helpless that he needed protection, and he was determined to show his bravery. Watcher again attempted to signal to Bushytail to go away, with wilder and wilder gestures.
Perhaps thinking that Bushytail hadn’t seen him, Watcher let out a wail.
Immediately, all four humans looked directly at Watcher, detecting his presence.
After that, everything happened quickly.
One of the humans picked up a stick and pointed it at Watcher. There was a loud bang and Watcher fell down. In a matter of seconds, he was silent, and a red stain began to spread from his small body, a stark contrast to the ground’s white covering. Watcher had achieved his goal: the wail had focused the attention of all four humans on Watcher, giving Bushytail the opportunity to escape. The humans walked towards Watcher to see what it was they had killed. There were two more loud bangs, and more laughter.

High Clowder Cats
50 ratings","What a lovely young adult novel! This story follows a young kit named Bushytail on his journey from feral city cat to his adventures finding his place in the wilderness. The author did an amazing job creating this realistic-feeling novel from the perspective of a cat. The way the human world was described was quite humorous using terms like, “concrete rivers” and “loud rumblers” being used to name a few. There were also many themes woven into the narrative. Themes following conserving the environment, personal growth, love and loss, and ‘The Golden Rule’. The beginning of the story was mainly about Bushytail and his experiences as a young kit traveling outside the city to find his place. When he meets a small clowder of misfits, he is quickly taught a few lessons about what it means to be a clowder cat. He develops relationships with the cats in this small group, both positive and negative, before the small clowder splits up after a disgraceful run-in with humans. Bushytail ends up taking a long journey with older cat, Bristle, as winter approaches to find a new clowder. Bristle is a Gandalf-like character, guiding and teaching Bushytail the ways of the world and instilling important lessons in him. These lessons help Bushytail overcome the many conflicts he faces on his journey to find a clowder and start a family. Bushytail teaches us many things, such as responsibilities, leadership, and to be encouraging to others, especially during difficult times. I will certainly be recommending this book! I rate this novel five out of five. This was a very well-thought-out novel following many important life themes that are useful to young adults and adults alike. There are multiple character arcs to follow, each teaching important life elements. Each cat had their own “voice,” making the dialogue a joy to read. The novel appeared to be professionally edited, as no spelling or grammatical errors were noted. Give this book a try, I’m looking forward to reading the sequel!"

Chapter 1 Pastor B Meets the Welcoming Committee
Driving home from the get-acquainted interview, Reverend Alan Burke was unsure what to think. Some of the things the welcoming committee members told him were ... well ... let’s say, a bit odd. Other conversations revealed a conflict.
This would be his last assignment before retirement. Coming from a large, successful, suburban mega-church to this declining, old, inner-city parish was, according to his bishop, not so much a rescue assignment as a place to relax and coast to the finish line.
“Those folks are retired and well-heeled. They will treat you right,” promised Bishop Remarque. “We’ve been friends for forty years, Alan. I’ve watched you spend seventy-hour weeks, not taking a vacation in years, and building up that great congregation. But you’re leaving it in good hands—younger hands. Now, you deserve to enjoy yourself. River Heights Church doesn’t expect much. Those people know it is only a matter of time until it closes. All they want you to do is keep it open for their group meetings and funerals,” he chuckled. “Give them a decent fifteen-minute sermon on Sunday mornings, get them out of there in time to beat the traffic for lunch, and they’ll be happy.”
Alan knew better than to put too much stock in first impressions, but some of the bishop’s opinions seemed more than accurate. This congregation was well-heeled and generous, too. His salary would be close to what he had been earning in the much larger church he left behind.
The “East” (East River City) parsonage was a 100-year-old mansion modernized and updated with the latest kitchen. Alan’s wife had swooned over the granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, and the twice-weekly maid service. The two-acre grounds were beautiful and came with a part-time gardener. Alan would have a long drive to the church, but “We cannot have our pastor living in the inner city,” explained Dale Dykstra, the board chairman. In fact, most of the parishioners had also moved to “East town” or out to the suburbs.
Alan’s back had bristled when the committee began reviewing the church’s spooky history, dating back to the 19th century. He was a conservative preacher and prided himself on preaching from the Bible. Privately, he resolved to preach a series on the afterlife. There were plenty of texts he could use to dispel any notions of disturbing sightings and communicating with spirits. He would correct that nonsense soon enough.
“What is your vision for building the church, looking ahead for a year or so?” Alan had asked, attempting to change the subject. People looked away, inspected their nails, or checked their cell phones. Alan gazed around the table at the committee members, trying to catch an eye. “Anyone?” he invited.
“Harrumph,” chairman Dykstra cleared his throat. “Well, Pastor Burke,” he began, “we have done about all we can in this neighborhood. Isn’t that right, Roberta?” he tossed the ball to the church secretary.
“Yes, sir, of course,” she nodded without amplification.
“Um,” Alan smiled encouragingly. “Can you say a little bit more about that?” he gazed directly at Roberta, who looked at Dykstra. Alan turned to the chairman. “Any suggestions?”
“Well, we had a neighborhood barbecue, sent out flyers, that sort of thing.”
“And a bake sale,” added one of the ladies.
“And a craft sale at Christmas,” said another.
“Three years ago,” muttered Clyde Dickens, seated at the far end of the table. Alan glanced up quickly.
“Three years ago, you say?” Alan prompted.
“At least. Maybe four or five. And nothing since. Let’s face it, This church isn’t growing. You all have given up,” Clyde accused. He was the only younger adult seated at the table, tall, good-looking, and dressed casually in jeans and a sweater. He wore a plain, golden wedding ring.
“Now, Clyde,” admonished the older woman sitting beside him. They looked enough alike to be mother and son. She quieted him with a finger to her mouth and a slight shake of her head.
“Well, it’s true,” he lowered his voice, “and you know it.” He frowned at her. “We need more young people with families.”
The chairman picked up a typewritten sheet in front of him. “We gave some thought to appointing a search committee,” he said, looking down.
“Oh, a search committee?” asked Alan.
“Well, before we can build, the first thing is to find a parcel of land in a better location, you know?” said the chairman.
“Out in a more prosperous area,” a new voice agreed.
Alan smiled at the well-dressed older man, who had been quiet until now.
“That way, the church would be closer to us,” added the man. Alan had done his homework. He knew the man was a prosperous builder and owned several downtown office buildings.
Several people leaned forward in their chairs, hoping to see Alan’s reaction. Alan carefully schooled his face in a pleasant expression. His years of experience had taught him how to remain non-committal. After a proper interval, in which the other man said nothing more, Alan returned to the chairman.
“Let’s see here,” said Dale Dykstra as he put on his reading glasses and squinted at the sheet. “I believe the next thing on the agenda is plans for a church-wide reception. Do we have a report on that, please?”
*****
Driving home, Alan thought, That went about as well as expected. Although the older established church members were content with how things were, the younger members were not satisfied with stagnation. I’m going to need to call on that Clyde Dickens right away.
If anyone knew how to build a congregation, it was Alan Burke. But do I want to take this on?
It would be good to talk this over with his wife, Sharon. Perhaps a shared nightcap by the fireplace would restore his spirit. He sighed and turned into his driveway. It was good to be home.

Chapter 2 Pastor B’s First Day
“Good morning, Roberta,” Pastor Alan Burke set two Starbucks coffees down and turned to hang up his suit jacket, revealing a matching vest, trousers, white shirt, and bow tie. Wire-rimmed spectacles framed warm brown eyes that twinkled at Roberta. “How do you take your coffee?” he asked.
The church secretary smiled. “Good morning, Pastor,” she said. “And thank you for the coffee. My goodness that is so nice.”
“Well, I didn't know how you take it, so I brought a variety of additions,” he said, revealing a choice of fancy creamers and sugars.
“Just black is fine, but you can leave those things there. Maybe I'll try something new,” she grinned. Roberta was one of those middle-aged women who defied the years. It was impossible to tell how old she was. Her highlighted brown hair was neatly styled and sprayed in a salon every Saturday morning. Her stylish reading glasses hung around her neck from a delicate silver chain. Most days, she wore a proper pantsuit and comfortable shoes.
Burke pulled out a chair and popped open his coffee, stirring in cream and sugar. “So, what do you have for me this morning?” he inquired genially.
Roberta took a sip of her coffee. “Well, the mail comes in later. But, there are some things on your desk from last week. You may want to go through and discard most of it. Also, there are some call-back messages on your desk.”
“Thanks. Is there a church calendar somewhere?”
“On your desk.”
“Very good, thank you.” He held his coffee and leaned back in his chair. “Have you typed up the minutes of the meeting last night?” he inquired.
“Well, no, not yet, but I will get those to you this morning,” Roberta answered.
“I wonder what you thought of the meeting.”
“What do you mean?” she asked. She wasn't accustomed to offering an opinion or having her opinion asked.
“Oh well, just any impressions, you know. How did it go?” He smiled encouragingly but stayed relaxed.
“Um, well... I guess it went well. What do you think?” She tossed the question back.
“I think I'd better get busy,” he chuckled. “I'll be working here for an hour or so and then going out on calls.”
“Calls?” she echoed, her voice rising.
“Sure, you know, calls on parishioners, neighbors, business people, hospital calls, that sort of thing. Don't all pastors make calls?”
“I guess they do in some churches. I'm just not used to that.”
Alan took his coffee and stood up. “I see. Well, I suppose it isn't everyone's 'thing,' but I enjoy it. I'll be in my office if anyone calls. Excuse me, please.” He strode down the short hall to his office.
*****
At precisely eleven am, Burke rang the doorbell in a nearby apartment. It was a big old house that had been subdivided into four units. A young woman partially opened the door while holding a nine-or-ten-month-old baby on one hip. “Good morning, Mrs. Dickens?” Hat in hand, Alan put on his most charming smile.
Amanda Dickens merely scowled and remained behind the screen.
“Excuse me if I'm interrupting. I'm Alan Burke, the new pastor at River Heights Church.” He extended his hand. “I don't believe we've met.”
“Oh my goodness!” Amanda was astonished. “Pastor Burke!”
“That's me at your service.” He chuckled. “May I come in for a minute?”
“Uh, I'm just feeding my daughter.”
“I won't stay long.” He held out a brochure.
Amanda opened the screen door, took the brochure, and gestured him in. “Please excuse the mess.”
“No excuse necessary, Mrs. Dickens. Thank you for inviting me in.” Alan followed her through the living room and out into the kitchen. Amanda secured the baby into a high chair and took her seat.
“Please sit down, Pastor Burke,” she said.
“Thank you. I'll only stay a minute. But I'd love to watch you feed the baby. Can I help?”
“I'll just give Mandy a pouch.” Amanda picked up a baby-feeding pouch. The little girl stretched out her hand and opened her mouth.
“What is that thing?” asked Alan. “I've never seen that before.”
“Well, this is Mandy's vegetables.” Amanda unscrewed the cap and held it to the baby's mouth. Mandy put both her chubby little hands around her mother's and began sucking.
“Isn't that amazing?” Alan exclaimed. “What an ingenious way to feed babies!”
“I know. It sure makes things easier. No clean-up. Just toss it away in the trash.”
“I should say.” He leaned closer.
“Also, it's a good way to get them to eat their vegetables,” she chuckled. “Clyde told me about the meeting last night. Sorry I couldn't be there.”
“Well, yes. I was hoping to call on Clyde, too. Is he around?”
“No, he's at work. But you might be able to catch him on his lunch hour.” She glanced at her watch.
“Clyde said something about the church needing more young people,” Alan offered.
“Yes, we would like that. Not that all the members aren't nice to us. But, you know....”
“Of course, I understand perfectly. It would be great to have a few other young parents.
“We only attend the church because of Clyde's folks.”
“I see. I think that Clyde's mother was there last night, too.”
“Yes, my mother-in-law has been active in the church all her life. Maybe not so much now.” The baby was finished eating. Amanda rose to throw the spent feeding tube away and grab a cloth from the counter. Expertly, she wiped the baby, unfastened her, and put her into a jumper seat.
Alan watched in fascination. “Well, I must be going, Mrs. Dickens.” He stood. “Maybe I'll stop by and see your husband.”
“I'll see you to the door.”
He stopped and turned toward her. “No, no, I can let myself out. But thank you. It was nice meeting you. Hopefully, I'll see you and your sweet daughter next Sunday.”
“We'll be there. Always,” Amanda added with a slight head shake.
“Oh, one more thing. Is there anyone you would like me to call on?” asked Alan. “Maybe I can invite some of your friends to the church.”
She looked at him in surprise. “Really? You would do that?”
“Of course. Just give me their names and addresses.”
“I'll make you a list.”
“Great! I would like that. Please hand it to me next Sunday. I'll make the calls. Mark any that you would rather I not use your name.”
“I'll do that, Pastor. Thanks for stopping by.”
“My pleasure, Mrs. Dickens. Have a nice day with that little sweetheart of yours. Goodbye.”
“Goodbye, Pastor Burke.”
Alan left quietly, taking care not to let the door slam.

Chapter 3 Pastor B Meets Clyde Dickens
It was precisely twelve noon when Alan Burke entered Zonderhopf's retail store. For a moment, he looked around at the stacks of Christian books for sale before he stepped up to the counter.
“Good afternoon,” he began. He held out his business card. “I'm the new preacher at River Heights Church.”
The clerk took the card and glanced at it. “Welcome to River City, Pastor.” He looked at the card again. “Pastor Burke. It's nice to meet you.”
“Thank you. It's good to be here.”
“How can I be of help? As you can see, we have a vast inventory of Christian books, everything from graduate-level reference books to casual Christian fiction. And if we don't have it here, we can order from anywhere worldwide.” He paused. “Zonderhopf's is the biggest retailer of Christian books and one of the largest publishers.”
“Well, thank you. That is good to know. I'm sure I'll be using you many times in the future. But now I dropped in to see if one of my parishioners is free for lunch.”
“Oh? Well, that's possible. Who are you looking for?”
“Clyde Dickens. Is he around?”
“Yes, he is working out in the back. Can I call him for you?”
“Maybe you can just point me in the right direction.”
“Let me take you part way,” said the clerk helpfully.
“Okay, thank you so much.”
“Follow me, please.”
Alan followed him through the door into a large warehouse.
“Over there in the back, I think.” The clerk gestured.
“Thank you, kindly,” said Alan. He started to shake hands but jerked away when the clerk put two fingers to his mouth and let out an ear-piercing whistle.
A tall, light-haired man poked his head around a pallet of books ready for shipping. “Hello,” he called.
“Hello, Clyde,” Alan Burke raised his arm and waved.
“Pastor Burke,” Clyde's smile was a mile wide. “What a surprise!”
They started walking toward each other.
“Excuse me,” said the clerk, who returned to his workstation.
“What are you doing here?” asked Clyde as he shook Alan's hand.
“I wondered if we could have lunch,” Alan grinned and held up a McDonald's bag.
“Well, shiver my timbers, will you look at that?”
“I hope you like burgers and fries with a chocolate malt.”
“Pastor Burke, are you crazy?”
“I think there is general agreement on that question.” Alan looked around at the warehouse. “Where can we sit?”
“I've got a little place over there in the corner.” Clyde led the way to a cozy setup with a small table, two chairs, a sink, and a little refrigerator. “How's this?”
“Works for me,” said Alan as he set the McDonald's bag on the table and pulled out a chair.
Clyde turned to the sink, opened the faucet, and picked up a soap bar. He scrubbed his hands and arms, dashed some water on his face, slicked back his hair, and dried his hands and face with paper towels.
“Mind if I join you?” asked Alan, gesturing towards the sink.
“Sure, please go ahead.” Clyde pulled out a chair and sat down, reaching for the McDonald's bag.
“Go ahead and set that stuff out, please,” said Alan as he quickly washed and dried his hands. Returning to his seat, he offered to say a prayer. “Lord, we give you thanks for good people like Clyde who are preparing these Christian books for the world. May they bless thousands of people and bring them closer to you. We ask your blessing on this food and on our time here together. Amen.”
“Thank you,” said Clyde.
“You are so welcome, Clyde,” Alan smiled. “What's say we dig in?” He began unwrapping a sandwich.
“Mmm, good,” Clyde remarked. “This sure hits the spot. I was hungry. I didn't have time for breakfast. The baby kept me up last night.”
“I met your little daughter this morning.”
“You did? How did that happen? I didn't know she was going out to the church this morning.”
“No, no. I called at your house, Clyde. Thought I might catch you in. Your wife suggested I might join you here at lunchtime. It worked out.” He shrugged and took a bite.
“Oh, okay.”
“Sweet family you have.”
“Maybe so, but I don't get to see Amanda much anymore.”
“How's that?”
“Well, she's a nurse, you know.”
“I see.”
“And babysitters are so expensive. We must juggle our schedules as much as possible so that one of us is with Mandy.”
“That's tough,” Alan agreed, reaching for a french fry. “Wouldn't it be nice if you could catch a break occasionally?”
“Um-huh.” Clyde nodded and chewed on his sandwich.
“Of course, even if there was help available, it would cost a lot, wouldn't it?” asked Alan.
“Yeah, we are both working, but you saw that dump we're living in. We're trying to save up for another house. Hopefully, one in a good school district.”
“Too bad the church isn't helping you,” Alan mentioned thoughtfully.
“What do you mean?” Clyde perked up. “What can a church possibly do?”
Well, River Heights has a beautiful nursery, don't you think?” Alan raised his eyebrows.
“Yes, I suppose so,” said Clyde as he finished his sandwich and started on the chocolate malted and fries.
“It would have to pass inspection, of course, and employ certified workers,” said Alan. “But even one afternoon or evening a week would be a big help, wouldn't it? Give you and Amanda some private time together. Free to member families, of course.”
Suddenly interested, Clyde asked, “Did you have that in your former church?”
“Well, it was a much bigger congregation, of course. Many churches do a lot of things. Not just nursery services. It's just a thought.” Alan began crumbling up the papers. “I've kept you long enough, Clyde. I want to thank you for your time.”
“The honor was mine, Pastor. Thanks for coming.”
“May I join you for lunch again someday?”
“Oh, yes. Please do. And next time, I'll bring lunch.”
“You're on, son, you're on.” He stood up and started clearing the table.
“No, Pastor. Leave that stuff be. I'll take care of it.”
“You're sure?”
“Yes, I've got a trash can right over there. Easy.” He waded all the paper into a ball and made a perfect 3-point basket.
“So, you play basketball?” Alan surmised.
“All-state point guard,” said Clyde, brightly. “But not anymore.” His voice fell.
“Really? Maybe we could get up a scratch game sometime,” suggested Alan. “The church has that beautiful gym.”
“I wish I had time, Pastor.”
“I hear you. Well... I've got to run along. See ya' later, Clyde. You have a good afternoon.”
“You, too, Pastor Burke.”
Alan whistled as he left.

Chapter 4 Donovan Tower
It was just 12:30 pm when he left Zonderhopf's. Alan had already put in a good day's work, but he was just getting started. He hoped to make the rounds of the entire church board before this week was out. Somewhere in that time, he expected God to give him the topic for his first Sunday sermon at River Heights church.
First up was Bill Donovan, the successful builder Alan had met briefly at the welcoming committee meeting. Alan liked to call on people at their places of work or business if possible. This gave him an insight into the person's life that could not be obtained in any other way. While, according to society's norms, it might be considered rude, Alan liked to arrive unannounced, thus giving the person no time to hide anything they might not want the pastor to see.
Alan pulled into the entrance to the basement parking garage of Donovan Towers and stopped at the guard house. He offered his driver's license to the waiting guard. “Good afternoon. Reverend Alan Burke is calling on Bill Donovan,” he announced.
The guard examined Alan's ID. “Is this your first visit to Donovan Tower, sir?”
“Yes, it is.”
The guard typed on a computer keyboard, causing a printer to clatter in the background. After inserting a printout into a plastic sleeve, the guard said, “Here is your ID, Reverend Burke.” He handed the ID to Alan. “Please wear this around your neck anytime you enter the building.”
Alan put the ID around his neck. “Thank you, sir,” he said.
“Just park in any yellow space and take the express elevator to the top floor. Have a good day, Reverend Burke.”
“You, too, thanks. I'll see you in church,” he smiled, waved, and drove off.
Alan would have liked to walk up the stairs for exercise, but he feared the exertion would leave him a sweaty mess. Instead, he rode up twelve floors, exited the elevator, moved to a polished reception desk, and offered his card. “Good afternoon. I'm Reverend Alan Burke. I'm here to see Bill Donovan.”
An attractive young woman dressed in a power suit and a beautifully coiffed hairdo accepted his card. A large diamond ring sparkled on her third finger, left hand. “Do you have an appointment?” she asked, gazing at the card.
“No, ma'am, I do not. I'm Mr. Donovan's pastor. I only need a minute.”
“Of course. Let me see.” She tapped a perfectly shaped crimson nail on a leather-bound appointment schedule. The diamond flashed. “Can you come back tomorrow at 11:30 or Wednesday at five?”
“No, that won't do. I'll wait, thank you.”
“I'm afraid Mr. Donovan is tied up all day,” she protested politely.
“No problem. I'll sit over here until he has a break. Thank you.” Alan smiled, turned, and approached a sitting area. After perusing the original artwork above the couch, he reached for a magazine off the glass coffee table, sat down, crossed his legs, and leaned back. He opened the magazine with another smile and began leafing through the pages. A man wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase emerged in a few minutes from the adjoining office, followed by Mr. Donovan. The man moved directly to the elevator.
Alan placed the magazine on the table and stood. “Hello, Bill,” he said.
“Well, look who's here!” Bill Donovan exclaimed. “What a surprise!”
Alan extended his hand. “I'm making the rounds. Beautiful building you have here, Bill.”
“Thank you. Pastor.” He took Alan's hand. “God has been good to us.”
After a firm handshake, Alan asked, “How is your day going, Bill?”
“The usual weekday morning, you know, if it isn't one thing, it's another.” He scowled.
“Un-huh.” Alan looked at him with concern. “Any problems?”
Bill blew out his breath. “You don't want to know.”
“Sure, I do.” Alan waited, hoping that Bill would invite him into the office.
Bill seemed to consider it. He hesitated. “Listen, Pastor, I'd invite you in, but I was just leaving to go to one of my building sites. I'm afraid I ...”
“I've got time, Bill. I'd love to ride along.”
“Really? There may be problems.”
“Yes, really. I'd like to see what you are doing. If you don't mind. In fact, I can drive you.”
“I can't promise how long this will take.”
“I've got all afternoon, Bill, and nothing is more important to me. You're my parishioner.”
Bill looked at him with fresh eyes. “Well, okay. Just let me grab my stuff.”
“You do that. I'll get my car and wait for you out in front of the building.”
“Maybe I can return a few calls while you drive.”
“Perfect,” said Alan with a smile. “I'll be your silent chauffeur.”
Alan walked over and punched the elevator button. He turned sidewise just in time to see Bill lean over and speak softly to the beaming receptionist.

Chapter 5 Donovan Subdivision
Alan pulled his car up to the front door of Donovan Tower at the same time as Bill Donovan exited the building. “Perfect timing, Pastor,” Bill smiled as he entered the passenger seat and buckled his seat belt.
“We make a good team,” said Alan. “Can you give me the address, please?” he asked. “I'll program it into my GPS.” Alan deftly inputted the building site's location into his GPS and inserted the earpiece into his ear. Pulling out into traffic, he advised Bill to proceed with his work. “I'll be quiet,” he promised.
At first, Bill Donovan wasn't sure what to make of this pastor. He watched Alan expertly maneuver through the downtown traffic and onto the freeway. After a few minutes, he pulled out his cell phone and began answering the messages, one by one, with curt replies dictated aloud. Sometimes, it was a simple yes or no or a few words, like “I'll get back to you,” “Cancel the order,” “Easy,” or “Next Thursday for sure.” But then he seemed upset, shaking his head and running fingers through his hair. “Now see here, you bitch! Don't you threaten me! Do you want to see me in court? Okay, you're on. Have your lawyer call my lawyer.” He clicked off, clenched his teeth, and made a fist. He blew out his breath and glanced sidewise at Alan. “Sorry, Pastor,” he said.
Alan stared straight ahead and made no acknowledgment. Mentally, he shrugged it off. Their exit was coming up. Alan followed the spoken instructions coming into his earpiece and drove through the countryside to a new subdivision. They entered a stone gate with the sign “Donovan Acres.” Rows of new houses lined the streets, followed by houses in various stages of construction.
“Just pull up here,” said Donovan. “I want to run in and talk to my construction boss. That's his truck.” He pointed.
Alan pulled in behind the truck.
“Do you want to come in?” asked Donovan.
“No, you go ahead, Bill,” said Alan. “You're busy. Maybe another time.” Alan waved him off.
Donovan was gone for ten minutes. Alan occasionally saw him walking through the house with a handsome, dark-skinned man dressed in work clothes and carrying a clipboard. They were engaged in an earnest discussion, with pointing and gestures, but Alan could hear none of their conversation.
When Donovan returned, his face appeared clouded. “Take me up to the sales office,” he said, sinking back in the seat and glaring out the window.
Alan had noticed the reception office near the entrance of one of the homes. This time, Bill wasn't gone long. When he returned, he tossed a handful of glossy brochures into the car before taking his seat, leaned back, sighed, and closed his eyes. “Let's go back,” he said.
They pulled onto the freeway.
“What a mess,” said Bill. His eyes were still closed.
Alan didn't know what to say. “Hmm,” he responded, reaching over to pat Bill's hand.
“It's not easy,” Bill rolled over to his other side.
“No, it's not,” said Alan.
“Sometimes, I wish ...” Bill paused. “Oh, hell, I don't know.” His voice fell off.
“Life,” said Alan.
“You got it. Life.”
“Dear Jesus, please give Bill a brief moment of peace,” said Alan softly.
A fresh rain began to fall. The noise of the car tires humming, the wind rushing, and the rhythmic swish of the wiper blades had a calming effect. Bill sank lower in the seat.
When Alan exited the freeway, Bill began to stir.
“Where to next?” asked Alan.
Bill sat up and rubbed his eyes. “Oh, thanks, Pastor. You can drop me off at my office.”
“Okay,” said Alan.
A few minutes later, Alan pulled up to the front entrance. Bill thanked him profusely and stepped out.
“See you Sunday.” Alan smiled and waved goodbye.

Chapter 6 Office Work
It was almost four o'clock when Alan Burke returned to his office in the church. He hoped to catch Roberta, the church secretary before she left for the day.
“Good afternoon, Roberta,” said Alan, as he hung up his jacket. “How did your day go?”
“Good afternoon, Pastor,” she returned. “I had a busy day, thank you.”
“Oh?”
“Yes, I finished up those minutes for you. They are on your desk with your messages and mail. I didn't open it, but I tried to sort it for you, with the obvious junk mail in one pile, personal letters by themselves, and inter-church business in a pile. I tried to put anything important on top. I send the bills that are addressed to the church to the treasurer. Is that okay?”
“I would like to see those from time to time. Is this the treasurer’s mailbox?” asked Alan.
“Yes, over there with his name on it.”
“I don't want to go through his mailbox. And so, maybe, for a few weeks, you can leave the bills on my desk so I can get familiar with the workings of the church. I will glance through them and return them to your desk for distribution.”
“Okay,” said Roberta as she reached for today's bills and handed the pile to Alan. “There is a new patient in the hospital, Sadie Perkins, one of our Golden Circle members.”
“Oh?”
“She's at Mercy Hospital. I don't know much about it.”
“I'll get up to see her later.”
“I'm sure they will appreciate it, Pastor.”
“Anything else?”
“No, that's all I have for you. I'll be leaving soon unless you need me.”
“Just a couple of questions, Roberta. First, do you work every day here? And when do you do the Sunday bulletin?”
“Wednesday is my day off. And I will do the bulletin on Friday unless you want to change things.”
Alan thought for a minute. “I'll try to have the worship details to you by Friday morning. For now, we'll stick with your usual routine and see how it goes. Let's give ourselves a month and then plan to have a meeting to evaluate. How does that sound?”
“That sounds good.”
“Okay, just whistle when you leave, so I'll know.”
Alan breezed through his mail and returned several phone calls. By six o'clock, he was ready to go to the hospital. He should be home for dinner tonight. It was a good day.
The weary pastor bowed his head in his hands and talked over the day's events with Jesus. The morning calls were on Amanda, her daughter Mandy, and later her husband. Clearly, the two of them were headed toward marital trouble if they didn't get some relief from the constant separation. Would the church be able to start a nursery and daycare one evening a week? And Alan would love to rejuvenate the church's basketball court. And then there was Bill Donovan. Something serious was going on in that man's life. “Jesus, I offer these people to you for your guidance. Lead me in the way you would have me go.” Amen
On the spur of the moment, Alan decided to tour the church building before leaving for the night. Opening his desk drawer, he took out a large key ring loaded with keys. My goodness, this key ring is heavy, Alan thought. He grabbed his jacket and a flashlight on the way out. There wouldn’t be any heat in the rest of the building during the week, and some old offices had no electric lights. Down a long corridor, he walked by one of the old offices. Stopping for a second, he seemed to change his mind and turn around. He fumbled for the key. Dale Dykstra had given Alan a tour of the building, so Alan knew this office belonged to one of the early founding pastors. What was his name? Ebenezer Something-or-other. I must look that up. After trying several keys, Alan got the door open.
Stale air greeted his nose. It reminded him of rancid cigars. He shined the flashlight inside. There was a bookshelf, an old chair, a desk with an oil lamp and ink well, and what appeared to be an old Bible, open to the book of Psalms. Fascinated, Alan picked up the Bible and carefully opened it. Ah, this is so old, I’d better put it down. He laid the Bible on the desk and used the flashlight to check the inside cover and first few pages for marks of any kind. Seeing nothing, he closed the book and left. I’ll come back sometime during the day and look this over more carefully.
Turning left down a half flight of stairs and another corridor to the annex, he unlocked and entered the gym. With his flashlight, he searched for light switches. He found a single switch that turned on one big bank of overhead fluorescent lights, but the main switch box must be elsewhere. Oh, well. This is enough for now, he thought. The place would need some serious cleaning before it could be used. The floors and walls needed refinishing. There was no way to tell the condition of the bench seats. Were they even safe? Alan shuddered to think of the bathrooms. We’d have to find a contractor to give us an estimate. Alan’s thoughts immediately turned to Bill Donovan. The man has troubles. But this place could be great. I wonder if there is a church league. Whoa, slow down Burke. First things first.
Alan locked the door and continued down the corridor and a few steps into the sanctuary, where he paused to listen. It wasn’t necessary to turn on any lights. Enough light from the street filtered through the priceless, old, stained-glass windows. Occasionally, car lights flashed directly through the windows, casting a moving rainbow of colors.
Alan realized the original church, founded in the eighteen-hundreds, was burned to the ground. This building was built on the very site where it was believed several escaped slaves perished in the fire. No records were saved. Alan didn’t believe the tale that their spirits haunted the building, but some of his parishioners loved to tell the story.
Moving from the sanctuary, Alan inspected the church nursery nearby. It was kept up to code, scrupulously clean, and well-equipped. During the church’s heyday, there might be as many as twenty infants and young babies here on Sunday morning. Now, they seldom had more than one or two. Some of the older board members would like to close half of the nursery, but Mandy Dickens’ grandmother wouldn’t hear of it. Alan quickly prayed for wisdom and guidance and hurried back to his office. He would lock the church for the night and proceed to Mercy Hospital to call on Sadie Perkins before going home for some much-needed rest.
Tomorrow would be another interesting day, calling on his board members.

This modern hospital complex had multiple entrances, exits, buildings, annexes, and parking lots. Alan circled the block twice and chose a likely-looking parking area.

Pastor B and the River Heights Church
Pastor B and the Haunted Church
Dorothy May Mercer
Chapter 1 Pastor B Meets the Welcoming Committee
Driving home from the get-acquainted interview, Reverend Alan Burke was unsure what to think. Some of the things the welcoming committee members told him were ... well ... let’s say, a bit odd. Other conversations revealed a conflict.
This would be his last assignment before retirement. Coming from a large, successful, suburban mega-church to this declining, old, inner-city parish was, according to his bishop, not so much a rescue assignment as a place to relax and coast to the finish line.
“Those folks are retired and well-heeled. They will treat you right,” promised Bishop Remarque. “We’ve been friends for forty years, Alan. I’ve watched you spend seventy-hour weeks, not taking a vacation in years, and building up that great congregation. But you’re leaving it in good hands—younger hands. Now, you deserve to enjoy yourself. River Heights Church doesn’t expect much. Those people know it is only a matter of time until it closes. All they want you to do is keep it open for their group meetings and funerals,” he chuckled. “Give them a decent fifteen-minute sermon on Sunday mornings, get them out of there in time to beat the traffic for lunch, and they’ll be happy.”
Alan knew better than to put too much stock in first impressions, but some of the bishop’s opinions seemed more than accurate. This congregation was well-heeled and generous, too. His salary would be close to what he had been earning in the much larger church he left behind.
The “East” (East River City) parsonage was a 100-year-old mansion modernized and updated with the latest kitchen. Alan’s wife had swooned over the granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, and the twice-weekly maid service. The two-acre grounds were beautiful and came with a part-time gardener. Alan would have a long drive to the church, but “We cannot have our pastor living in the inner city,” explained Dale Dykstra, the board chairman. In fact, most of the parishioners had also moved to “East town” or out to the suburbs.
Alan’s back had bristled when the committee began reviewing the church’s spooky history, dating back to the 19th century. He was a conservative preacher and prided himself on preaching from the Bible. Privately, he resolved to preach a series on the afterlife. There were plenty of texts he could use to dispel any notions of disturbing sightings and communicating with spirits. He would correct that nonsense soon enough.
“What is your vision for building the church, looking ahead for a year or so?” Alan had asked, attempting to change the subject. People looked away, inspected their nails, or checked their cell phones. Alan gazed around the table at the committee members, trying to catch an eye. “Anyone?” he invited.
“Harrumph,” chairman Dykstra cleared his throat. “Well, Pastor Burke,” he began, “we have done about all we can in this neighborhood. Isn’t that right, Roberta?” he tossed the ball to the church secretary.
“Yes, sir, of course,” she nodded without amplification.
“Um,” Alan smiled encouragingly. “Can you say a little bit more about that?” he gazed directly at Roberta, who looked at Dykstra. Alan turned to the chairman. “Any suggestions?”
“Well, we had a neighborhood barbecue, sent out flyers, that sort of thing.”
“And a bake sale,” added one of the ladies.
“And a craft sale at Christmas,” said another.
“Three years ago,” muttered Clyde Dickens, seated at the far end of the table. Alan glanced up quickly.
“Three years ago, you say?” Alan prompted.
“At least. Maybe four or five. And nothing since. Let’s face it, This church isn’t growing. You all have given up,” Clyde accused. He was the only younger adult seated at the table, tall, good-looking, and dressed casually in jeans and a sweater. He wore a plain, golden wedding ring.
“Now, Clyde,” admonished the older woman sitting beside him. They looked enough alike to be mother and son. She quieted him with a finger to her mouth and a slight shake of her head.
“Well, it’s true,” he lowered his voice, “and you know it.” He frowned at her. “We need more young people with families.”
The chairman picked up a typewritten sheet in front of him. “We gave some thought to appointing a search committee,” he said, looking down.
“Oh, a search committee?” asked Alan.
“Well, before we can build, the first thing is to find a parcel of land in a better location, you know?” said the chairman.
“Out in a more prosperous area,” a new voice agreed.
Alan smiled at the well-dressed older man, who had been quiet until now.
“That way, the church would be closer to us,” added the man. Alan had done his homework. He knew the man was a prosperous builder and owned several downtown office buildings.
Several people leaned forward in their chairs, hoping to see Alan’s reaction. Alan carefully schooled his face in a pleasant expression. His years of experience had taught him how to remain non-committal. After a proper interval, in which the other man said nothing more, Alan returned to the chairman.
“Let’s see here,” said Dale Dykstra as he put on his reading glasses and squinted at the sheet. “I believe the next thing on the agenda is plans for a church-wide reception. Do we have a report on that, please?”
*****
Driving home, Alan thought, That went about as well as expected. Although the older established church members were content with how things were, the younger members were not satisfied with stagnation. I’m going to need to call on that Clyde Dickens right away.
If anyone knew how to build a congregation, it was Alan Burke. But do I want to take this on?
It would be good to talk this over with his wife, Sharon. Perhaps a shared nightcap by the fireplace would restore his spirit. He sighed and turned into his driveway. It was good to be home.

Chapter 2 Pastor B’s First Day
“Good morning, Roberta,” Pastor Alan Burke set two Starbucks coffees down and turned to hang up his suit jacket, revealing a matching vest, trousers, white shirt, and bow tie. Wire-rimmed spectacles framed warm brown eyes that twinkled at Roberta. “How do you take your coffee?” he asked.
The church secretary smiled. “Good morning, Pastor,” she said. “And thank you for the coffee. My goodness that is so nice.”
“Well, I didn't know how you take it, so I brought a variety of additions,” he said, revealing a choice of fancy creamers and sugars.
“Just black is fine, but you can leave those things there. Maybe I'll try something new,” she grinned. Roberta was one of those middle-aged women who defied the years. It was impossible to tell how old she was. Her highlighted brown hair was neatly styled and sprayed in a salon every Saturday morning. Her stylish reading glasses hung around her neck from a delicate silver chain. Most days, she wore a proper pantsuit and comfortable shoes.
Burke pulled out a chair and popped open his coffee, stirring in cream and sugar. “So, what do you have for me this morning?” he inquired genially.
Roberta took a sip of her coffee. “Well, the mail comes in later. But, there are some things on your desk from last week. You may want to go through and discard most of it. Also, there are some call-back messages on your desk.”
“Thanks. Is there a church calendar somewhere?”
“On your desk.”
“Very good, thank you.” He held his coffee and leaned back in his chair. “Have you typed up the minutes of the meeting last night?” he inquired.
“Well, no, not yet, but I will get those to you this morning,” Roberta answered.
“I wonder what you thought of the meeting.”
“What do you mean?” she asked. She wasn't accustomed to offering an opinion or having her opinion asked.
“Oh well, just any impressions, you know. How did it go?” He smiled encouragingly but stayed relaxed.
“Um, well... I guess it went well. What do you think?” She tossed the question back.
“I think I'd better get busy,” he chuckled. “I'll be working here for an hour or so and then going out on calls.”
“Calls?” she echoed, her voice rising.
“Sure, you know, calls on parishioners, neighbors, business people, hospital calls, that sort of thing. Don't all pastors make calls?”
“I guess they do in some churches. I'm just not used to that.”
Alan took his coffee and stood up. “I see. Well, I suppose it isn't everyone's 'thing,' but I enjoy it. I'll be in my office if anyone calls. Excuse me, please.” He strode down the short hall to his office.
*****
At precisely eleven am, Burke rang the doorbell in a nearby apartment. It was a big old house that had been subdivided into four units. A young woman partially opened the door while holding a nine-or-ten-month-old baby on one hip. “Good morning, Mrs. Dickens?” Hat in hand, Alan put on his most charming smile.
Amanda Dickens merely scowled and remained behind the screen.
“Excuse me if I'm interrupting. I'm Alan Burke, the new pastor at River Heights Church.” He extended his hand. “I don't believe we've met.”
“Oh my goodness!” Amanda was astonished. “Pastor Burke!”
“That's me at your service.” He chuckled. “May I come in for a minute?”
“Uh, I'm just feeding my daughter.”
“I won't stay long.” He held out a brochure.
Amanda opened the screen door, took the brochure, and gestured him in. “Please excuse the mess.”
“No excuse necessary, Mrs. Dickens. Thank you for inviting me in.” Alan followed her through the living room and out into the kitchen. Amanda secured the baby into a high chair and took her seat.
“Please sit down, Pastor Burke,” she said.
“Thank you. I'll only stay a minute. But I'd love to watch you feed the baby. Can I help?”
“I'll just give Mandy a pouch.” Amanda picked up a baby-feeding pouch. The little girl stretched out her hand and opened her mouth.
“What is that thing?” asked Alan. “I've never seen that before.”
“Well, this is Mandy's vegetables.” Amanda unscrewed the cap and held it to the baby's mouth. Mandy put both her chubby little hands around her mother's and began sucking.
“Isn't that amazing?” Alan exclaimed. “What an ingenious way to feed babies!”
“I know. It sure makes things easier. No clean-up. Just toss it away in the trash.”
“I should say.” He leaned closer.
“Also, it's a good way to get them to eat their vegetables,” she chuckled. “Clyde told me about the meeting last night. Sorry I couldn't be there.”
“Well, yes. I was hoping to call on Clyde, too. Is he around?”
“No, he's at work. But you might be able to catch him on his lunch hour.” She glanced at her watch.
“Clyde said something about the church needing more young people,” Alan offered.
“Yes, we would like that. Not that all the members aren't nice to us. But, you know....”
“Of course, I understand perfectly. It would be great to have a few other young parents.
“We only attend the church because of Clyde's folks.”
“I see. I think that Clyde's mother was there last night, too.”
“Yes, my mother-in-law has been active in the church all her life. Maybe not so much now.” The baby was finished eating. Amanda rose to throw the spent feeding tube away and grab a cloth from the counter. Expertly, she wiped the baby, unfastened her, and put her into a jumper seat.
Alan watched in fascination. “Well, I must be going, Mrs. Dickens.” He stood. “Maybe I'll stop by and see your husband.”
“I'll see you to the door.”
He stopped and turned toward her. “No, no, I can let myself out. But thank you. It was nice meeting you. Hopefully, I'll see you and your sweet daughter next Sunday.”
“We'll be there. Always,” Amanda added with a slight head shake.
“Oh, one more thing. Is there anyone you would like me to call on?” asked Alan. “Maybe I can invite some of your friends to the church.”
She looked at him in surprise. “Really? You would do that?”
“Of course. Just give me their names and addresses.”
“I'll make you a list.”
“Great! I would like that. Please hand it to me next Sunday. I'll make the calls. Mark any that you would rather I not use your name.”
“I'll do that, Pastor. Thanks for stopping by.”
“My pleasure, Mrs. Dickens. Have a nice day with that little sweetheart of yours. Goodbye.”
“Goodbye, Pastor Burke.”
Alan left quietly, taking care not to let the door slam.

Chapter 3 Pastor B Meets Clyde Dickens
It was precisely twelve noon when Alan Burke entered Zonderhopf's retail store. For a moment, he looked around at the stacks of Christian books for sale before he stepped up to the counter.
“Good afternoon,” he began. He held out his business card. “I'm the new preacher at River Heights Church.”
The clerk took the card and glanced at it. “Welcome to River City, Pastor.” He looked at the card again. “Pastor Burke. It's nice to meet you.”
“Thank you. It's good to be here.”
“How can I be of help? As you can see, we have a vast inventory of Christian books, everything from graduate-level reference books to casual Christian fiction. And if we don't have it here, we can order from anywhere worldwide.” He paused. “Zonderhopf's is the biggest retailer of Christian books and one of the largest publishers.”
“Well, thank you. That is good to know. I'm sure I'll be using you many times in the future. But now I dropped in to see if one of my parishioners is free for lunch.”
“Oh? Well, that's possible. Who are you looking for?”
“Clyde Dickens. Is he around?”
“Yes, he is working out in the back. Can I call him for you?”
“Maybe you can just point me in the right direction.”
“Let me take you part way,” said the clerk helpfully.
“Okay, thank you so much.”
“Follow me, please.”
Alan followed him through the door into a large warehouse.
“Over there in the back, I think.” The clerk gestured.
“Thank you, kindly,” said Alan. He started to shake hands but jerked away when the clerk put two fingers to his mouth and let out an ear-piercing whistle.
A tall, light-haired man poked his head around a pallet of books ready for shipping. “Hello,” he called.
“Hello, Clyde,” Alan Burke raised his arm and waved.
“Pastor Burke,” Clyde's smile was a mile wide. “What a surprise!”
They started walking toward each other.
“Excuse me,” said the clerk, who returned to his workstation.
“What are you doing here?” asked Clyde as he shook Alan's hand.
“I wondered if we could have lunch,” Alan grinned and held up a McDonald's bag.
“Well, shiver my timbers, will you look at that?”
“I hope you like burgers and fries with a chocolate malt.”
“Pastor Burke, are you crazy?”
“I think there is general agreement on that question.” Alan looked around at the warehouse. “Where can we sit?”
“I've got a little place over there in the corner.” Clyde led the way to a cozy setup with a small table, two chairs, a sink, and a little refrigerator. “How's this?”
“Works for me,” said Alan as he set the McDonald's bag on the table and pulled out a chair.
Clyde turned to the sink, opened the faucet, and picked up a soap bar. He scrubbed his hands and arms, dashed some water on his face, slicked back his hair, and dried his hands and face with paper towels.
“Mind if I join you?” asked Alan, gesturing towards the sink.
“Sure, please go ahead.” Clyde pulled out a chair and sat down, reaching for the McDonald's bag.
“Go ahead and set that stuff out, please,” said Alan as he quickly washed and dried his hands. Returning to his seat, he offered to say a prayer. “Lord, we give you thanks for good people like Clyde who are preparing these Christian books for the world. May they bless thousands of people and bring them closer to you. We ask your blessing on this food and on our time here together. Amen.”
“Thank you,” said Clyde.
“You are so welcome, Clyde,” Alan smiled. “What's say we dig in?” He began unwrapping a sandwich.
“Mmm, good,” Clyde remarked. “This sure hits the spot. I was hungry. I didn't have time for breakfast. The baby kept me up last night.”
“I met your little daughter this morning.”
“You did? How did that happen? I didn't know she was going out to the church this morning.”
“No, no. I called at your house, Clyde. Thought I might catch you in. Your wife suggested I might join you here at lunchtime. It worked out.” He shrugged and took a bite.
“Oh, okay.”
“Sweet family you have.”
“Maybe so, but I don't get to see Amanda much anymore.”
“How's that?”
“Well, she's a nurse, you know.”
“I see.”
“And babysitters are so expensive. We must juggle our schedules as much as possible so that one of us is with Mandy.”
“That's tough,” Alan agreed, reaching for a french fry. “Wouldn't it be nice if you could catch a break occasionally?”
“Um-huh.” Clyde nodded and chewed on his sandwich.
“Of course, even if there was help available, it would cost a lot, wouldn't it?” asked Alan.
“Yeah, we are both working, but you saw that dump we're living in. We're trying to save up for another house. Hopefully, one in a good school district.”
“Too bad the church isn't helping you,” Alan mentioned thoughtfully.
“What do you mean?” Clyde perked up. “What can a church possibly do?”
Well, River Heights has a beautiful nursery, don't you think?” Alan raised his eyebrows.
“Yes, I suppose so,” said Clyde as he finished his sandwich and started on the chocolate malted and fries.
“It would have to pass inspection, of course, and employ certified workers,” said Alan. “But even one afternoon or evening a week would be a big help, wouldn't it? Give you and Amanda some private time together. Free to member families, of course.”
Suddenly interested, Clyde asked, “Did you have that in your former church?”
“Well, it was a much bigger congregation, of course. Many churches do a lot of things. Not just nursery services. It's just a thought.” Alan began crumbling up the papers. “I've kept you long enough, Clyde. I want to thank you for your time.”
“The honor was mine, Pastor. Thanks for coming.”
“May I join you for lunch again someday?”
“Oh, yes. Please do. And next time, I'll bring lunch.”
“You're on, son, you're on.” He stood up and started clearing the table.
“No, Pastor. Leave that stuff be. I'll take care of it.”
“You're sure?”
“Yes, I've got a trash can right over there. Easy.” He waded all the paper into a ball and made a perfect 3-point basket.
“So, you play basketball?” Alan surmised.
“All-state point guard,” said Clyde, brightly. “But not anymore.” His voice fell.
“Really? Maybe we could get up a scratch game sometime,” suggested Alan. “The church has that beautiful gym.”
“I wish I had time, Pastor.”
“I hear you. Well... I've got to run along. See ya' later, Clyde. You have a good afternoon.”
“You, too, Pastor Burke.”
Alan whistled as he left.

Chapter 4 Donovan Tower
It was just 12:30 pm when he left Zonderhopf's. Alan had already put in a good day's work, but he was just getting started. He hoped to make the rounds of the entire church board before this week was out. Somewhere in that time, he expected God to give him the topic for his first Sunday sermon at River Heights church.
First up was Bill Donovan, the successful builder Alan had met briefly at the welcoming committee meeting. Alan liked to call on people at their places of work or business if possible. This gave him an insight into the person's life that could not be obtained in any other way. While, according to society's norms, it might be considered rude, Alan liked to arrive unannounced, thus giving the person no time to hide anything they might not want the pastor to see.
Alan pulled into the entrance to the basement parking garage of Donovan Towers and stopped at the guard house. He offered his driver's license to the waiting guard. “Good afternoon. Reverend Alan Burke is calling on Bill Donovan,” he announced.
The guard examined Alan's ID. “Is this your first visit to Donovan Tower, sir?”
“Yes, it is.”
The guard typed on a computer keyboard, causing a printer to clatter in the background. After inserting a printout into a plastic sleeve, the guard said, “Here is your ID, Reverend Burke.” He handed the ID to Alan. “Please wear this around your neck anytime you enter the building.”
Alan put the ID around his neck. “Thank you, sir,” he said.
“Just park in any yellow space and take the express elevator to the top floor. Have a good day, Reverend Burke.”
“You, too, thanks. I'll see you in church,” he smiled, waved, and drove off.
Alan would have liked to walk up the stairs for exercise, but he feared the exertion would leave him a sweaty mess. Instead, he rode up twelve floors, exited the elevator, moved to a polished reception desk, and offered his card. “Good afternoon. I'm Reverend Alan Burke. I'm here to see Bill Donovan.”
An attractive young woman dressed in a power suit and a beautifully coiffed hairdo accepted his card. A large diamond ring sparkled on her third finger, left hand. “Do you have an appointment?” she asked, gazing at the card.
“No, ma'am, I do not. I'm Mr. Donovan's pastor. I only need a minute.”
“Of course. Let me see.” She tapped a perfectly shaped crimson nail on a leather-bound appointment schedule. The diamond flashed. “Can you come back tomorrow at 11:30 or Wednesday at five?”
“No, that won't do. I'll wait, thank you.”
“I'm afraid Mr. Donovan is tied up all day,” she protested politely.
“No problem. I'll sit over here until he has a break. Thank you.” Alan smiled, turned, and approached a sitting area. After perusing the original artwork above the couch, he reached for a magazine off the glass coffee table, sat down, crossed his legs, and leaned back. He opened the magazine with another smile and began leafing through the pages. A man wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase emerged in a few minutes from the adjoining office, followed by Mr. Donovan. The man moved directly to the elevator.
Alan placed the magazine on the table and stood. “Hello, Bill,” he said.
“Well, look who's here!” Bill Donovan exclaimed. “What a surprise!”
Alan extended his hand. “I'm making the rounds. Beautiful building you have here, Bill.”
“Thank you. Pastor.” He took Alan's hand. “God has been good to us.”
After a firm handshake, Alan asked, “How is your day going, Bill?”
“The usual weekday morning, you know, if it isn't one thing, it's another.” He scowled.
“Un-huh.” Alan looked at him with concern. “Any problems?”
Bill blew out his breath. “You don't want to know.”
“Sure, I do.” Alan waited, hoping that Bill would invite him into the office.
Bill seemed to consider it. He hesitated. “Listen, Pastor, I'd invite you in, but I was just leaving to go to one of my building sites. I'm afraid I ...”
“I've got time, Bill. I'd love to ride along.”
“Really? There may be problems.”
“Yes, really. I'd like to see what you are doing. If you don't mind. In fact, I can drive you.”
“I can't promise how long this will take.”
“I've got all afternoon, Bill, and nothing is more important to me. You're my parishioner.”
Bill looked at him with fresh eyes. “Well, okay. Just let me grab my stuff.”
“You do that. I'll get my car and wait for you out in front of the building.”
“Maybe I can return a few calls while you drive.”
“Perfect,” said Alan with a smile. “I'll be your silent chauffeur.”
Alan walked over and punched the elevator button. He turned sidewise just in time to see Bill lean over and speak softly to the beaming receptionist.

Chapter 5 Donovan Subdivision
Alan pulled his car up to the front door of Donovan Tower at the same time as Bill Donovan exited the building. “Perfect timing, Pastor,” Bill smiled as he entered the passenger seat and buckled his seat belt.
“We make a good team,” said Alan. “Can you give me the address, please?” he asked. “I'll program it into my GPS.” Alan deftly inputted the building site's location into his GPS and inserted the earpiece into his ear. Pulling out into traffic, he advised Bill to proceed with his work. “I'll be quiet,” he promised.
At first, Bill Donovan wasn't sure what to make of this pastor. He watched Alan expertly maneuver through the downtown traffic and onto the freeway. After a few minutes, he pulled out his cell phone and began answering the messages, one by one, with curt replies dictated aloud. Sometimes, it was a simple yes or no or a few words, like “I'll get back to you,” “Cancel the order,” “Easy,” or “Next Thursday for sure.” But then he seemed upset, shaking his head and running fingers through his hair. “Now see here, you bitch! Don't you threaten me! Do you want to see me in court? Okay, you're on. Have your lawyer call my lawyer.” He clicked off, clenched his teeth, and made a fist. He blew out his breath and glanced sidewise at Alan. “Sorry, Pastor,” he said.
Alan stared straight ahead and made no acknowledgment. Mentally, he shrugged it off. Their exit was coming up. Alan followed the spoken instructions coming into his earpiece and drove through the countryside to a new subdivision. They entered a stone gate with the sign “Donovan Acres.” Rows of new houses lined the streets, followed by houses in various stages of construction.
“Just pull up here,” said Donovan. “I want to run in and talk to my construction boss. That's his truck.” He pointed.
Alan pulled in behind the truck.
“Do you want to come in?” asked Donovan.
“No, you go ahead, Bill,” said Alan. “You're busy. Maybe another time.” Alan waved him off.
Donovan was gone for ten minutes. Alan occasionally saw him walking through the house with a handsome, dark-skinned man dressed in work clothes and carrying a clipboard. They were engaged in an earnest discussion, with pointing and gestures, but Alan could hear none of their conversation.
When Donovan returned, his face appeared clouded. “Take me up to the sales office,” he said, sinking back in the seat and glaring out the window.
Alan had noticed the reception office near the entrance of one of the homes. This time, Bill wasn't gone long. When he returned, he tossed a handful of glossy brochures into the car before taking his seat, leaned back, sighed, and closed his eyes. “Let's go back,” he said.
They pulled onto the freeway.
“What a mess,” said Bill. His eyes were still closed.
Alan didn't know what to say. “Hmm,” he responded, reaching over to pat Bill's hand.
“It's not easy,” Bill rolled over to his other side.
“No, it's not,” said Alan.
“Sometimes, I wish ...” Bill paused. “Oh, hell, I don't know.” His voice fell off.
“Life,” said Alan.
“You got it. Life.”
“Dear Jesus, please give Bill a brief moment of peace,” said Alan softly.
A fresh rain began to fall. The noise of the car tires humming, the wind rushing, and the rhythmic swish of the wiper blades had a calming effect. Bill sank lower in the seat.
When Alan exited the freeway, Bill began to stir.
“Where to next?” asked Alan.
Bill sat up and rubbed his eyes. “Oh, thanks, Pastor. You can drop me off at my office.”
“Okay,” said Alan.
A few minutes later, Alan pulled up to the front entrance. Bill thanked him profusely and stepped out.
“See you Sunday.” Alan smiled and waved goodbye.

Chapter 6 Office Work
It was almost four o'clock when Alan Burke returned to his office in the church. He hoped to catch Roberta, the church secretary before she left for the day.
“Good afternoon, Roberta,” said Alan, as he hung up his jacket. “How did your day go?”
“Good afternoon, Pastor,” she returned. “I had a busy day, thank you.”
“Oh?”
“Yes, I finished up those minutes for you. They are on your desk with your messages and mail. I didn't open it, but I tried to sort it for you, with the obvious junk mail in one pile, personal letters by themselves, and inter-church business in a pile. I tried to put anything important on top. I send the bills that are addressed to the church to the treasurer. Is that okay?”
“I would like to see those from time to time. Is this the treasurer’s mailbox?” asked Alan.
“Yes, over there with his name on it.”
“I don't want to go through his mailbox. And so, maybe, for a few weeks, you can leave the bills on my desk so I can get familiar with the workings of the church. I will glance through them and return them to your desk for distribution.”
“Okay,” said Roberta as she reached for today's bills and handed the pile to Alan. “There is a new patient in the hospital, Sadie Perkins, one of our Golden Circle members.”
“Oh?”
“She's at Mercy Hospital. I don't know much about it.”
“I'll get up to see her later.”
“I'm sure they will appreciate it, Pastor.”
“Anything else?”
“No, that's all I have for you. I'll be leaving soon unless you need me.”
“Just a couple of questions, Roberta. First, do you work every day here? And when do you do the Sunday bulletin?”
“Wednesday is my day off. And I will do the bulletin on Friday unless you want to change things.”
Alan thought for a minute. “I'll try to have the worship details to you by Friday morning. For now, we'll stick with your usual routine and see how it goes. Let's give ourselves a month and then plan to have a meeting to evaluate. How does that sound?”
“That sounds good.”
“Okay, just whistle when you leave, so I'll know.”
Alan breezed through his mail and returned several phone calls. By six o'clock, he was ready to go to the hospital. He should be home for dinner tonight. It was a good day.
The weary pastor bowed his head in his hands and talked over the day's events with Jesus. The morning calls were on Amanda, her daughter Mandy, and later her husband. Clearly, the two of them were headed toward marital trouble if they didn't get some relief from the constant separation. Would the church be able to start a nursery and daycare one evening a week? And Alan would love to rejuvenate the church's basketball court. And then there was Bill Donovan. Something serious was going on in that man's life. “Jesus, I offer these people to you for your guidance. Lead me in the way you would have me go.” Amen
On the spur of the moment, Alan decided to tour the church building before leaving for the night. Opening his desk drawer, he took out a large key ring loaded with keys. My goodness, this key ring is heavy, Alan thought. He grabbed his jacket and a flashlight on the way out. There wouldn’t be any heat in the rest of the building during the week, and some old offices had no electric lights. Down a long corridor, he walked by one of the old offices. Stopping for a second, he seemed to change his mind and turn around. He fumbled for the key. Dale Dykstra had given Alan a tour of the building, so Alan knew this office belonged to one of the early founding pastors. What was his name? Ebenezer Something-or-other. I must look that up. After trying several keys, Alan got the door open.
Stale air greeted his nose. It reminded him of rancid cigars. He shined the flashlight inside. There was a bookshelf, an old chair, a desk with an oil lamp and ink well, and what appeared to be an old Bible, open to the book of Psalms. Fascinated, Alan picked up the Bible and carefully opened it. Ah, this is so old, I’d better put it down. He laid the Bible on the desk and used the flashlight to check the inside cover and first few pages for marks of any kind. Seeing nothing, he closed the book and left. I’ll come back sometime during the day and look this over more carefully.
Turning left down a half flight of stairs and another corridor to the annex, he unlocked and entered the gym. With his flashlight, he searched for light switches. He found a single switch that turned on one big bank of overhead fluorescent lights, but the main switch box must be elsewhere. Oh, well. This is enough for now, he thought. The place would need some serious cleaning before it could be used. The floors and walls needed refinishing. There was no way to tell the condition of the bench seats. Were they even safe? Alan shuddered to think of the bathrooms. We’d have to find a contractor to give us an estimate. Alan’s thoughts immediately turned to Bill Donovan. The man has troubles. But this place could be great. I wonder if there is a church league. Whoa, slow down Burke. First things first.
Alan locked the door and continued down the corridor and a few steps into the sanctuary, where he paused to listen. It wasn’t necessary to turn on any lights. Enough light from the street filtered through the priceless, old, stained-glass windows. Occasionally, car lights flashed directly through the windows, casting a moving rainbow of colors.
Alan realized the original church, founded in the eighteen-hundreds, was burned to the ground. This building was built on the very site where it was believed several escaped slaves perished in the fire. No records were saved. Alan didn’t believe the tale that their spirits haunted the building, but some of his parishioners loved to tell the story.
Moving from the sanctuary, Alan inspected the church nursery nearby. It was kept up to code, scrupulously clean, and well-equipped. During the church’s heyday, there might be as many as twenty infants and young babies here on Sunday morning. Now, they seldom had more than one or two. Some of the older board members would like to close half of the nursery, but Mandy Dickens’ grandmother wouldn’t hear of it. Alan quickly prayed for wisdom and guidance and hurried back to his office. He would lock the church for the night and proceed to Mercy Hospital to call on Sadie Perkins before going home for some much-needed rest.
Tomorrow would be another interesting day, calling on his board members.

Chapter 7 Mercy Hospital
This modern hospital complex had multiple entrances, exits, buildings, annexes, and parking lots. Alan circled the block twice and chose a likely-looking parking area.

ESSENTIAL INFORMATION FOR THE READER
Before I wrote Kalayla, I thought writers who said their characters talked to them were exaggerating, hallucinating, or fibbing. I found out they weren’t when it happened to me. Having the characters in my head was aggravating and exhausting. I needed a break, and although I knew I hadn’t resolved all the characters’ issues, I felt as if I’d done my best. I assumed that ending and publishing the book would be acceptable.
I was wrong. I didn’t understand that I had entered into a covenant with the characters. I didn’t realize they would feel abandoned and betrayed because I hadn’t finished telling their stories. I didn’t expect their response to be insistent and demanding.
The fact of the matter was I loved the characters, related to their struggles, and hadn’t meant to disappoint them. So, I recommitted, fully aware that they preferred late-night conversations, and sleepless nights would follow. I listened attentively and researched topics of concern to them. Outspoken characters continued to speak their minds, and to my delight, previously voiceless characters revealed their complicated and tangled backgrounds. 
I concluded I couldn’t simply write a sequel to Kalayla. I had to rewrite the story and incorporate what I learned, which I did in Kalayla Unraveling Tangles. The book was a fascinating and joyous collaboration that showcases the complexity of the characters’ lives. I thank my family and friends, who encouraged me to persevere, and I am grateful the characters are satisfied and comfortingly silent.
Exploring the dynamics in Kalayla’s extended family encouraged me to think about my life’s tangles and pose a question for myself and the readers. How do we unravel our tangles with kindness and help ourselves and others find a constructive way forward?
KALAYLA’S FAMILY TREE
Bold indicates characters who are important in Kalayla’s life.
Notes:
Maureen’s mother (Colleen) and Kalayla’s great grandmother (Mary Margaret) moved from Belfast, Ireland to South Boston, MA after the death of Kalayla’s great grandfather (Colin).
When Colleen married Kevin O’Rourke, she moved from South Boston to Brighton, MA where Maureen was born.
Maureen moved to Cambridge from Brighton, MA when she married Kalayla’s father, Jamal. Kalayla was born in Cambridge, MA.

KALAYLA’S GREAT GRANDPARENTS
PRELUDE
BELFAST, IRELAND, 1960
The girl tucked her chair against the right side of the bed, her ear almost touching the lips of her father’s disfigured face. His voice was hoarse, barely audible, each word a painful effort, “I’m done,” Colin Doyle said, gasping for breath.
His daughter, Colleen, knew he would say more if he could. She waited, as she’d been waiting for six endless days.
Colleen had been afraid long before the lads carried her broken father home. Time and time again, she heard her mother, Mary Margaret, warn him to be cautious and to watch his words. Colleen had experience skirting Belfast’s danger, and she knew her mother was right. They lived among enemies whose smiling faces could turn to snarls with the slightest provocation. Despite her mother’s pleas, the daredevil side of Colin refused to reign in its cockiness.
Colin was a magician with machines, crooning to them softly, fixing any broken or improperly balanced. He believed his talent protected him. The Protestant bosses at the linen factory called Colin the devil Taig—as if his ability had its source in hell. Worse than that, Colin and Mary Margaret were Catholics in a sea of Protestant workers, any one of whom might repeat Colin’s arrogant taunts to the B Specials, the part-time constable police force in Northern Ireland.
Everyone knew Colin Doyle was on the list of suspected IRA members. He was a burly-brash man who danced on the narrowest of ledges as if he considered a Catholic taunting the B Specials a schoolyard game.
“No worries,” he’d tell Mary Margaret, pulling her close. “They’ll not be so foolish as to come after me.”
But one night six days ago, they saw the chance and did. Colin had gone with the neighborhood lads to the Horse Trough Pub, but when the others left, Colin waved them off. He’d won a few pence arm wrestling and would stay on to see if his luck would hold.
In the wee hours, Mary Margaret sent word that her husband hadn’t come home. The lads went searching and brought what was left of Colin back to her and Colleen. “IRA scum” was smeared in the blood on her husband’s chest, his mangled body a showpiece of brutality.
Mary Margaret knew what she had to do. Colleen would be ten soon, the age when children went to work in the linen factory. Mary Margaret’s childless sister and husband lived in South Boston in the United States, and they offered Mary Margaret and Colleen a place to live. Mary Margaret had no other choice. She couldn’t pay the rent, and it would be too dangerous for any friend or relative to take them in. They would stay in Belfast until after Colin had a proper Catholic burial.
Mary Margaret stowed her grief in her apron pocket and went to the linen factory every day from six a.m. to nine p.m. as Colin would expect her to.
While her mother worked, Colleen sat alone beside the body that had been her father. She knew he would expect her to be brave, but every sound was terrifying. When they found out Colin wasn’t dead, would they come to finish their work and they kill her, too? Or would they use her as their whore the way the neighborhood girls said they did if they caught you alone?
Later, when Colleen took her da bread and milk for his noontime meal, he took a ragged breath and said, “No food, no water. Our secret.”
Colleen closed her eyes and dug her nails into her clenched fists. She understood it had to be their secret. Her mother would never allow Colin to starve himself. She’d say it was a mortal sin, and the timing and manner of his death was God’s choice, not his.
Her da would scoff at that idea. Although Colin went with Mary Margaret and Colleen to mass every Sunday and on Holy Days of Obligation, he mocked church teachings with the same regularity. He told his daughter that sins were nothing more than a deck of cards in a game of make-believe. Colleen listened wide-eyed, trusting the handsome man who carried her on his shoulders, taught her to sing, spun bedtime stories of goblins, fairies, and dragons, and knew everything.
The battered body beside her bore no resemblance to that Da, but Colleen heard the echo of his tenor’s lilt in the ragged voice, and that was enough for her. She could do what he wanted. After all, she was nine years old, the miracle child, the one of five who lived. Three sisters died before she was born, and one brother after. Mum said the factory’s damp, foul air and ever-present coughing sickness made her womb unhealthy. Colleen had been strong enough to survive, and she was strong enough to set her father free to sing again.
SOUTH BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS/SOUTHIE
Colleen hated Southie more than she hated Belfast. The landscape in Belfast had been familiar, the tension as commonplace as the insults hurled by Catholic and Protestant kids across divided streets. The girl’s fear was monotonous and ever-present.
The landscape in Southie was unknown, a deafening source of terror. Noise from planes, trains, sirens, horns, and trolleys mingled with shouting adults and crying children. Teenage gangs wandered without defined boundaries. Music blared from their transistor radios and competed with record players from the Project’s open windows. Any step might trigger an invisible booby trap. The girl’s fear was intense and ever-present.
Her aunt’s and her uncle’s flat was in a Catholic enclave in the Old Dominion Housing projects, three-story brick buildings near a traffic circle and park. Neighborhood kids invited Colleen to go adventuring, but what if they were like her da, whose willingness to take risks had gotten him killed? When they grew tired of her excuses and stopped asking, she didn’t care. Colleen stayed observant, alert, and close to home.
Colleen’s mother wasn’t willing to settle for life in a housing project. Her sister was satisfied to be a part-time seamstress and pleased that her husband had a steady job as a postal worker. She didn’t have a daughter to spur her to a better life.
If Colin had listened to Mary Margaret, they would have moved to Cork or Dublin before Colleen turned three. But he didn’t, and she was left to deal with the consequences of his myopic vision. She’d had her fill of factory work and knew she could sell her domestic skills.
City Point was less than a two-mile walk from the Old Dominion projects but light years away in gentility and prosperity, with mansion-like houses beacons beckoning to a better life. With a subtle hint of arrogance, Mary Margaret spun a tale about her previous employment to the mistress of the grandest house, who hired her on the spot. The mistress could casually brag that she’d hired a household staff manager recently employed by the royal family to maintain their Belfast residence.
Mary Margaret told Colleen that night, “I’ll learn all I can about gentry life. God helped us get this far, Colleen. The rest is up to us.”
Colleen didn’t brag or preen in front of the other girls in the ensuing years. She made the honor roll but didn’t brown-nose the teachers. She helped classmates who struggled with math or English. Colleen’s aunt and uncle became surrogate parents. Her aunt enjoyed sewing school clothes for her, and when Colleen was old enough to attend Catholic mixers in Boston, her aunt added flattering tucks, ruffles, and ribbons. Colleen’s uncle was a quiet, unassuming man.
Colleen realized she couldn’t marry anyone mercurial like her da, whose firecracker mouth got him murdered. She needed a steady, solid man to raise a family without fear.
She was nearly eighteen when she met Kevin O’Rourke, an auto mechanic saving to buy a garage or two if things went as he planned. Kevin was down-to-earth and safe. He wanted three or four children and a home to welcome them and their friends. Colleen could build a life with him, and he wouldn’t shatter it.
SUMMER 1999
LENA MANERO BARZETTI
THAT GIRL
I’m not one of those old biddies who minds other people’s business instead of her own. But, there are some people it is impossible to ignore, and that girl, Kalayla, was one of them.
The first time I saw Kalayla was mid-June last year. I was walking back from Mickey’s Market on one of those perfect sunny days that made you believe you could live happily ever after. The National Scoop headline, “Princess Diana’s Death Revealed as Hoax,” made the same promise.
Kalayla was ahead of me, half swaggering, half strutting in a way so familiar I thought I must know her. I ruminated on it until I realized my twins walked like that when they were showing off, which was pretty much from the minute they got up until they went to bed.
How often had I seen those two boys swagger, strut, or taunt each other? Mikie would dare Jimmy, “Bet it takes you more than 20 seconds to shimmy up that streetlight.” Jimmy would dare Mikie, “Bet you can’t get five bucks panhandling between here and home.” Off they’d go, running, laughing, shoving and punching.
The blast from a horn jolted me out of daydreaming, or I’d have bumped right into Kalayla. She was staring into Hanson’s Book Store window, and her saucer-sized green eyes briefly glanced my way.
I pegged Kalayla as a Cambridge street kid scraping her way from one meal to the next, an old hand at trash picking and layering up with everything she found. That day, she wore three layers on top with a mishmash of colors and designs; a rope held up the baggy capri-length pants that would have been shorts on someone taller. A beat-up blue-and-red baseball cap with the brim turned backward squashed down her kinky orange-brown curls. She was an inch or two shorter than my five feet two inches, and I couldn’t tell how old she was. Most teenage girls wanted to show off their bodies, but Kalayla didn’t.
After that, I saw Kalayla everywhere I went. She was always by herself, and I wondered why. The only way my four boys were alone was if they were going to or coming from someplace where other kids were hanging out. Even my boy Mark, who was always getting in fights, had plenty of friends. If I were that girl’s mama, the fact she was alone so much would have worried me.
***
About two weeks later, I was walking back from buying milk and eggs at Mickey’s Market when I saw Kalayla talking to Maureen, the red-headed woman who waited tables at Eddie’s Eatery. Eddie’s was across from my apartment building, and sometimes I stopped by to chat. Maureen was friendly and cheerful but didn’t blab personal stuff like some folks. Eddie told me she was a widow with a daughter.
I watched Maureen kiss her on the forehead and go into Eddie’s. The girl had the same huge green eyes and delicate features Maureen did. Maureen’s skin was ivory, and the girl’s was light chocolate, but she had to be her daughter. She crossed the street and went into my apartment building. I hurried to see where she was going, but she had disappeared when I arrived.
I didn’t just live in the building. I owned it and the building where Eddie’s was located. They were the first properties Joey and I bought after we married, and our families solidified their business partnership by forming Manzetti Properties. Joey didn’t turn out to be much of a husband, but his family knew all the angles when it came to rehab and construction, and my family was skillful and shrewd at buying and marketing real estate.
My job was to locate vacant buildings or properties the owner was interested in offloading quickly. I kept my eye out for local contractors. It was good public relations to involve them in small tear-downs or rehabs and leave the big jobs to Joey’s crews. My office was at our corporate headquarters, and I still worked one or two days a week.
My brother Dominic was a financial wizard who’d been pretending to train his son and daughter to take over for him for the last three years. When I asked Dom if he knew anything about the girl and her mother, he laughed and said, “Have you been walking around with your eyes closed, Lena? Those two moved in across the hall from you.”
Well, I never! When they moved in, I must have been volunteering at Helping Hands Shelter for Women, having supper at Dom’s, or out with my best friend, Carlotta. That girl didn’t come across as if she wanted to keep a low profile, but Voles hunkered down underground would have gotten my attention faster than those two.
A few days later, I saw Kalayla on our landing, staring out the window like a lost soul, and it wrenched my heart. I’d looked out the window many times and wished I’d see Jimmy or Mikie strutting down the street. But no amount of wishing could bring them back from the dead. And no amount of wishing changed the fact that the girl reminded me of them. When we finally did speak, it was no surprise the first thing out of her mouth was a smart-assed comment, like my twins would have made.
When my boys were growing up, Lotta repeatedly told me to wash the twins’ mouths with soap. She never raised kids, or she would have known you can’t stick a bar of soap into a child’s mouth, no matter how tempted you might be.
KALAYLA LEEROYCE
THE OLD LADY
That crabby old lady would swear I never paid attention to a word she said, but she’d be wrong. Her name was Lena Barzetti, and I called her crabby ’cause that’s what she was ninety-five percent of the time. She was seventy-two years old, and boy, did she look it. I was exploring the new neighborhood that summer and got to know her.
It didn’t get dark until late, so I could be out without flipping Mama out. Our building was on a corner with a light, about halfway between Harvard Square and Arlington. Massachusetts Avenue had sidewalks. I could walk on one side of the street until I got bored, then cross the street and walk back on the other.
I liked meeting people who were walking their dogs. Pets weren’t allowed in our building. I told Mama it’d be easy to sneak in a dog or cat, but she lectured me about not doing anything to get us kicked out of the apartment—as if I would!
Second Time Clothes, White’s Fruits and Vegetables, and Mickey’s Market were within a few blocks. You could get your nails or toes done at Tammy’s Tips or your hair straightened at Creative Clips. Magneson’s Flower Shop owners were friendly, but my favorite place was Clean Duds Laundromat.
Regulars there knew better than to go on an errand while their laundry was in the washer or dryer. I earned an easy buck sitting with my feet propped up on the windowsill and reading a book like I owned the place. I kept an eye out for anybody with an empty basket or bag who acted like they were lost while they checked the place out. I’d give them a big smile and say, “You need help?” That cleared out the shifty types pretty fast.
***
One day, when I was standing on the landing between the third and fourth floors of the apartment building, staring out the window and planning my afternoon, I heard slow footsteps coming up the stairs. That was when I met old lady Lena.
The weird thing was she only wore black. Her dress, socks, and shoes were all black like she worked at a funeral home, and that was her uniform. She was dragging a couple of duffle bags. If she collapsed, I’d be stuck dialing 911.
She stopped when she got to the landing, and I saw that the bags were full of black clothes. She must’ve come from Clean Duds. She had to be dumber than dumb to live on the fourth floor of a building with no elevator. Besides, anybody smart would’ve taken small loads instead of everything they owned.
If I felt like starting a conversation—which I didn’t—I might’ve pointed that out.
The old lady said, “Little girl, if you don’t have anything to do, I can give you some work.”
Dumber than dumb, like I thought, right?
“If it looks to you like I’m hanging out here waiting for a job, you need glasses. And I’m not a little girl. I’m twelve years old.”
She stared at me long and hard. “Well, maybe you want to be an architect, and you’re staring at those buildings to get ideas. Good view from up here.”
I gotta say that was worth a laugh. “Nah,” I said, “I’m just planning my day.”
“Then how about helping me carry this laundry?”
“My mama told me not to talk to strangers or carry laundry for them. A good-looking girl like me has to be real careful.”
She stared longer and harder this time. Anybody could see I wouldn’t be crowned queen of the apartment building, even competing against people like her. Maybe her eyesight was lousy.
“Well,” she said, “I’m interested in your muscles, not your looks or mouth. I’ll give you a Coke for pay.”
“I don’t like Coke. I’ll take a root beer.”
“All kids like Coke, and I don’t have root beer. I have lemons, water, and sugar to make lemonade. I can throw in a few cookies. Will that satisfy you?”
“What kind of cookies?”
She rolled her eyes like she couldn’t believe I’d ask that, but I wasn’t lugging laundry for plain old sugar cookies.
“Peanut butter—fresh made.”
“Fine!” I said, heaving one bag over each shoulder.
Her apartment was the same as ours, but it was almost empty. Every wall was white, and there was nothing, not one thing, on them. The window shades and the rug in front of the sofa were white. The couch and chair were white. Everybody knew you’d have to wash or clean all that white every other day. Nobody but a rich person could afford that, and she sure didn’t look rich.
She said, “Don’t stand there gawking. Put the laundry bags in the closet in the spare room.”
That’d be my bedroom at home, but I couldn’t tell what it was for her. The walls, window shades, and rug in the middle of the room were all white. A small wooden table and a straight-back chair were near the window. Maybe she lived someplace else and came here ’cause she liked Clean Duds. I dumped the bags on the floor in the closet but felt like I’d messed things up.
She was in the kitchen mixing the lemonade, and I decided I better find out how crazy she was before I had any. So, I said, “Do you live in a monastery and just keep this place to store stuff?”
She gave me a big-time stare and said, “That smart mouth must get you in trouble at school. What would you know about a monastery?”
“I read a book that said the walls are white, and they give you a chair, a bed, an extra robe, a pair of shoes, and a box to store them.”
“Is that a fact? So, you read books?”
“Yeah. What of it? You never met a kid who reads books?” Why wasn’t she asking me the usual stupid adult questions like how I was doing in school and how many brothers and sisters I had?
“That would be an example of the mouth I was talking about. I’ve got a lot of books you could look at if you wanted to.”
Why’d she think I’d want to read her crummy old books? I thought about leaving until she brought out the peanut butter cookies. I tasted one and decided to stay long enough to eat a few.
“You can call me Lena,” she said. “And I suppose you have a name.”
Did she think my parents named me Girl like some jerks named their dog Dog?
“Sure, I got a name. It’s Kalayla.”
“Ka lay la,” she repeated slowly. “That’s unusual and pretty. Is it a family name?”
“Nah. My mama thought it up. She’s smart about some things.”
I drank a lot of lemonade that summer ’cause the old lady asked me for help every five minutes. Sometimes, she annoyed me so much I wanted to spit, but I wasn’t giving up free lemonade and cookies.
I didn’t mind ’cause Mama wasn’t home much. We got a car last year, and she cleaned houses before her four-nine shift at Eddie’s. Standing on the landing, I could watch her serving customers or clearing tables. Sometimes, I’d go over to hang out and have a snack.
Mama attended classes or did art projects when Daddy was alive instead of working. She didn’t have a studio now. Even if we had room for one, she was too busy working.
***
When summer came, Mama decided we should spend more time together and have Sunday morning talks. We’d sit at the kitchen table while she drank coffee, and I’d fix whatever I felt like eating. Mostly, Mama asked me questions, and I tried not to lie too much. Sometimes, I had to ’cause she was hyper-nervous about what I was doing and where I was going.
This morning, she said, “Are you going to the library today?”
I never told her the library was closed on Sundays during the summer, so I said, “Haven’t made plans yet, Mama. Is there something you want me to do?”
“Well, no, but if you’re going out, you might want to change your clothes.”
Cow turds! Even the old lady didn’t bug me about how I dressed, and she bugged me about plenty of stuff. Someday, I might try going naked to see if Mama liked that better!
Sometimes, Mama got going on how important family was, which was weird ’cause her family died in a gas explosion, so I never met them. Mama seemed nervous when we visited Daddy’s family, so I decided she liked talking about family more than being with it.
After Daddy died, his brother, Clarence, thought he’d do us a big favor and drop by to see us. He bragged about how good he was at getting good car deals and offered to find one for us. Clarence always made her nervous, so when she asked me what I thought, I said, “He’ll get us a car when he gets a real job.”
“Layla, I wish you wouldn’t say things like that about Clarence.”
“It’s the truth, so why shouldn’t I say it?”
“He’s your uncle, and you should be respectful.”
“I am respectful. I never called him a butthole to his face, did I?”
Mama sighed like she wished I’d shut my mouth, but she knew I wouldn’t.
For once, Clarence did what he said. He found a blue Ford with eighty thousand miles and not too many scrapes and dents. He kept bragging about how it had a fine American engine, and he had detailed it himself. I got sick of hearing that, so I said, “Wow! You mean you did something besides sit on your butt?” I took off before he could slap me. Mama started cleaning houses after we got the car.
***
My grandparents lived near Inman Square in Cambridge. After Daddy died, Grandma told everyone that Mama was exhausted and needed to rest, so we stayed with them. That was a bunch of bull. Mama wasn’t exhausted. She had a nervous breakdown. Grandma knew it; I knew it, and so did everybody else.
Staying with them would’ve been okay, except they dragged me to church. I wanted to tell Grandma they should take Clarence instead of me, but she would’ve said I was rude.
When Mama finally got back to normal, she got a job at Eddie’s, and we moved to a smaller apartment. Mama said decorating the apartment would be her art project, but everybody knew fixing up an apartment wasn’t the same as having a studio.
It was kind of funny, but once we moved to the new apartment, the person I saw the most was the old lady. She liked Clean Duds and dropped by every day with her iced coffee. I decided her life had to be pretty boring if all she had to do was take up my valuable time.
She’d pull up a chair and say something like, “Too hot to be out,” when it was just as hot inside as it was out. Clean Duds had a couple of standing fans chained to the wall, but all they did was blow around hot air and make a lot of noise.
Mama told me that black absorbs the most heat of any color. So, on one of those broiling days, I said, “If you’re so hot, why are you wearing black?”
She gave me the icy stare routine. “What color I wear and why I wear it is no business of yours!”
Fine! It would serve her right if she fried!
When the old lady wanted me to do stuff, she’d ask if I wanted to earn a Coke. That turned into a joke, and I’d say, “I’ll have a vanilla Coke float with chocolate ice cream, thanks.”
I got used to the whiteness in her apartment, and in a way, I kind of liked it. It was like a blank page, and you could decorate it any way you wanted. A small bookcase in the corner of the living room had photos of some boys. Mama had pictures of her, me, and Daddy everywhere, but Lena’s place wasn’t normal like ours.
One of the photos was of a beautiful woman standing in water a little above her ankles at the ocean. Her dark-brown hair was blowing around her shoulders, and the wind whipped her dress so you could see her legs. Two little boys were building a sand fort on the shore.
I pointed at the photo and said, “Is that a friend of yours?”
“A friend? That’s me you’re looking at, Kalayla, in my younger days.”
I covered my mouth to keep from snorting. I almost said, “Yeah, a couple hundred years ago,” but I already had her lecture on being polite memorized.
In another photo, the same woman held the two little boys to keep them from squirming away. Two older boys stood straight as statues beside them.
“Are those your kids? How come I never see them here?”
The old lady didn’t say anything for so long that I thought she might’ve gone deaf. Finally, she said, “I had four sons, and those photos were taken when they were little. You better go home, Kalayla. Your mama’s likely waiting.”

THE MAMA
That girl was sticking her nose into places she shouldn’t, like asking me about my boys. What good would come of me telling her two of them were dead, that I didn’t know if the third was living, and the fourth was a big-shot businessman who thought I was as desirable a mother as a field of poison ivy.
I decided I better get to know Kalayla’s mother. The fact I’d done a lousy job raising my boys meant I could give her plenty of good advice on what not to do.
I bagged a batch of Lotta’s cookies the following Sunday afternoon and went to Maureen’s. When she answered my knock, her smile was genuine, “Lena! I’m so glad it’s you! Please come in. Kalayla’s at the library; she’ll be sorry she missed you. I hope you’ll like what I’ve done to the apartment. I’m an artist, well, not a real artist. I mean, I’ve never earned any money with my art. Oh, do come in!” Maureen asked Dom if she could choose wall colors and do the painting herself. Of course, he said yes because he wouldn’t need to pay our painting crew. Dom’s knee-jerk reaction was to pinch every penny, nickel, dime, and quarter any way he could. The joke was that he didn’t know how much Maureen loved color! The entire apartment would have to be repainted when she moved out, and Dom would be on his high horse about that!
The wall colors reminded me of tropical fish with their brilliant colors. Two of the kitchen walls were yellow, and two were orange. The cushions, curtains, and wall decorations were a mixture of stripes, polka dots, and geometric shapes in yellow, orange, green, and white.
“Maureen, I don’t know what to say except what you’ve done is just plain wonderful!”
“Oh! I’m so relieved you like it. When Layla told me your apartment was all white, I was afraid you might ask us to repaint every room.”
“The house I lived in before I moved here was full of color. You should consider being a home decorator instead of waiting on tables and cleaning houses.”
“Oh, I’d love that, but I don’t have any formal training or experience, and I don’t have a college degree. I started on one, but—.”
If Maureen had gone on instead of stopping abruptly, I might have found out more, but instead, she gave me a tour of the apartment. Every room was unique, and her creativity was unmistakable.
When Maureen told me Kalayla was at the library on a Sunday afternoon in July, I knew I’d come just in time. I decided to get to know her before pointing out that her daughter was prone to altering the truth when it suited her.
After we settled in the living room with coffee and Lotta’s cookies, Maureen started talking again.
“I’m so glad you came, Lena. I can’t chat when I’m working. I wouldn’t want Eddie to think I was wasting time.”
“Don’t you worry about Eddie. He’d cut you some slack. Is this your first job?”
“Oh dear, is it that obvious? I didn’t work when Jamal was alive. I enrolled at Rhode Island School of Design as a part-time student, and took one or two classes each semester. It was taking forever, but I loved it. Our apartment was big enough that I had a studio, and after I had Kalayla, I put her crib there and later her pack ’n-play.
“When she started crawling, she was so quiet that I’d lose track of her. One day, I found her in the kitchen with everything from the bottom cupboards strewn on the floor. Jamal put on baby-proof cupboard locks and gates across the doorways. That worked until she figured out how to climb over them.
“When Jamal died, my life changed completely.”
I took a sip of coffee and waited for Maureen to go on, but she’d run out of steam. She fiddled with the handle of her mug until I said, “Your family must have been a big help when your husband died.”
Stricken was the only way to describe Maureen’s expression, and I knew I’d stumbled onto a right big sore spot.
“My family? No, they didn’t help, but my in-laws were good to us. Lucina and Harmon would have helped us move, and Jamal’s brother, Clarence, would have, too, but I wasn’t sure if that would cause problems.”
I didn’t bother asking why Maureen thought having Jamal’s family move them in might be a problem. It was 1999, but the idea of whites and blacks getting together still rubbed some folks the wrong way. It wouldn’t have bothered me, but Maureen might’ve found out the hard way that not everybody felt like I did. You could never tell when bigotry would come around the corner and hit you in the face.
Uncle Clarence must be the black guy I’d seen who stopped in and left about ten minutes later. When it came to helping, you’d think an uncle would do more than a drive-by on the way to somewhere else.
Before I could say anything, Maureen said, “Kalayla told me she sees you at Clean Duds. I’m glad I have the chance to ask you. She’s not getting into any trouble, is she? I mean, like hanging out with the wrong kids?”
Huh! I wished Kalayla had friends, and her mama was afraid she’d find the wrong ones!
“As far as I can tell, she doesn’t hang out with anyone.”
“That’s a relief. Kalayla told me you have four boys. I bet they were a handful! I’m having a hard time with one girl. You must be so glad they’re all grown. How are they doing?”
I admit that stopped me. Everybody knew about my family, and I never had to explain why, when, or how things happened to my boys or my husband.
I could have told Maureen my twins joined the Marines during the anti-war protests. I could have told her my second son, Mark, had disappeared from the face of the earth about fifteen years ago, and I didn’t know if he was alive. I could have told her I worried that my oldest boy, JJ, had become a clone of his dad, which was the worst thing he could have done.
Eventually, I said, “My oldest, JJ, runs the construction side of our family business. My second boy, Mark, moved out West. I’m not sure where he is or what he’s doing. The twins, Jimmy and Mikie, were the youngest. They were killed in Vietnam less than a year after their dad died.”
The color drained from Maureen’s face.
“How awful!” she said. “Now I understand why you wear black. Oh dear, that didn’t come out right. I just meant I’m so sorry.”
Yeah, everybody was sorry, especially me.
LATER IN THE DAY
Talking to Maureen made me think about Joey, how he loved high living and being the top man, how he bragged that his boys were like him, and I hoped they weren’t.
Joey said acting out was healthy for boys because they needed to prove themselves. He said the trouble they got into was good, harmless fun. I believed him until I realized not all the fun was harmless.
I was sure Mark was doing fine in school until I got calls saying he wasn’t.
“Mrs. Barzetti? This is John DiSilva, the principal at Mark’s school. I’m calling about an incident at lunch today. Mark smashed another kid’s piece of pie in his face.”
I knew Mark had a temper, but I’d never seen it get out of hand. Joey told me all boys fight with their brothers and that I should ignore it. So I did, but picking a fight outside the family was different.
“My Mark?” I said. “That doesn’t make sense. You must have him mixed up with some other boy.”
“I don’t think so, Mrs. Barzetti. He’s sitting right here in my office. You can ask him yourself.”
There was no doubt it was Mark’s voice saying: “Yeah, Ma, I ate the lunch you made me. I wasn’t going to eat his pie. But the kid is an asshole and does stuff that aggravates me, like giving me looks. Today, he bragged that he had a steak sandwich and cherry pie. I got sick of it. You should have seen him with cherries dripping down his face. I hope he gets a beating for ruining his shirt.”
“Mark! Shame on you! That’s not …”
“Ma, listen, okay? Dad wouldn’t put up with that, so why should I?”
“Don’t tell me what your dad would do! We’re talking about what you did!”
“Ma, I know. I promise I won’t do it again. Mr. D. wants to talk to you.”
Mark said he wouldn’t do it again, but he made a lot of promises he never kept. Nothing was ever his fault, and fighting over aggravations became the story of his life.
“I’m trying, Ma,” he’d tell me, and maybe he did.
Mark never had anybody watching his back like the twins did for each other. When JJ was four, and Mark was three, Joey told JJ to toughen up his younger brother. JJ used Mark as a punching bag. At first, Mark came to me for protection, but Joey called him a mama’s boy. That was far worse than anything JJ did to him.
JJ and his father were over six feet, and the twins were six feet by the time they turned fourteen. Joey rubbed it in by nicknaming Mark “Shrimp.”
I never got calls about the twins getting into fights, but they found other ways of getting into trouble. On their first day in kindergarten, the principal suspended them from the school bus for three days for teaching the other boys to play poker, which the school considered gambling.
I told Joey we should make them walk to school as a punishment. He laughed, “Why should they walk? They’re chips off the old block. Don’t worry, Lena. I’ll talk to them. The next time, they’ll be smart enough to hide the damn cards and not to admit anything. If you want to keep that fancy car I gave you, you’ll drive them to school until they can ride the bus.”
So I did.
They were eight when I grounded Jimmy for forgetting a chore, and they informed me they now had a punishment sharing agreement. When I told them I’d never heard of such a thing, Mikie said, “Yeah, Ma, that’s because we just invented it.”
“Your turn,” Jimmy would say, and Mikie would take the punishment for something his brother had done. It nearly drove me crazy.
When I tried punishing both for something one of them had done, they cocked their heads, gave me their lopsided grins, and said together, “Ahh, Ma, that’s not fair!” They were constantly whispering, planning, and getting smarter.
The day Mikie brought a brand-new backpack home, I said, “Where’d you get that? You didn’t steal it, did you?”
They laughed hysterically, and Mikie said, “Ma, we’d be lousy thieves, but we’re the best at working angles. Look at all the cool pockets. This one is much better than my old one.”
The twins hid behind a flow of fast talk and excuses, Joey style. Of course, their father backed them up. “If they’re smart enough to get it, they can keep it. Learning to skate on thin ice without falling in is good for them.”
When they reached 7th grade, I stopped telling them to return things like a leather jacket, a signed baseball, or a camera.
Even Joey couldn’t drive a wedge between them. When Mikie wrecked his bike, they made do with one, taking turns riding on the handlebars and giving me heartburn. Joey would have bought Mikie any bike he wanted, but they were happy sharing.
When the twins turned sixteen, Joey said he’d buy each of them a car. Mikie and Jimmy huddled, discussing his offer, and told Joey one car would be enough. They went to every car showroom within biking distance, spent hours studying brochures, and debated the pros and cons of every model.
When Joey offered them his advice, they said, “We got it covered, Dad, thanks anyway.”
They agreed on a Shelby Mustang GT 500, and naturally, Joey got a good deal with extras thrown in. Mikie won the buck up over color, choosing dark moss green, and Jimmy picked the black leather upholstery.
They named the car Miss Clementine, and one or both were always polishing her. When Joey said Clementine was a ridiculous name for a car, they walked out the door and called, “Hey Ma, we’re taking sweet Miss Clementine for a ride.”
They were smart enough never to push Joey too far, and they got around me with smiles, sweet talk, and what I believed were good intentions. They explained their behavior with the most favorable interpretation, and all I could do was hope they were telling the truth.
When they gave me a dozen roses for my birthday, a purple silk scarf for Christmas, or a three-pound box of candy for Mother’s Day, I asked where they got the money.
“We run errands, rake leaves, and shovel snow to help people out, Ma. You ought to be proud of how helpful we are!”
We named our firstborn Joseph John Barzetti, Jr. after Joey. Everybody called him JJ. He worshipped his dad, followed Joey around, and listened to everything his father told him. I never got calls about his behavior.
I was certain Kalayla’s mama did not intend for her to run. I was never a young widow working two jobs and trying to keep track of a twelve-year-old daughter, but I knew that keeping track of kids was like chasing marbles going downhill. They kept on rolling, and you kept on running.
Somebody had to help Maureen. I didn’t see anybody volunteering, which left it up to me.
KALAYLA
HELPING THE OLD LADY
Old lady Lena was always sticking her nose in my business. That made me mad ’cause it reminded me how that jerk, Clarence, tried to butt into my life when Mama and I stayed with Grandma and Grandpa after Daddy died.
It took Grandma about fifteen seconds to enroll me in a school near them. On my second day, I was standing in the hall near my classroom when a fat-assed girl bumped into me.
“Hey, new kid,” she said. “I heard your grandma told you to pass for black so you could get into a fancy private school next year. Right?”
I could’ve slammed my fist into her fat face, but I didn’t. I could’ve asked her if she ate cow turds for breakfast, but I didn’t. The bell rang, and I ducked into class without saying anything. I knew better than to make trouble at school, and I was used to comments from butthole kids.
When Uncle Clarence asked me how I liked the school, I made the mistake of telling him what the kid said.
He cracked up laughing. “If you ever decide to pass, Kalayla, pass for white. You’ll be a beauty like your mama. A passel of dudes would pay plenty to get their hands on her creamy white skin. Your skin isn’t white, but it sure is a sweet chocolate!” He was still laughing when he went out the front door.
Clarence’s mouth was worse than mine, but if I told Mama that, she would’ve said, “Clarence is your only uncle. You should treat him with respect.”
I’d rather have no uncle than a turd like him, but if I said that, Mama would make me sit in the corner facing the wall. I hated that more than I hated shutting my mouth.
I wouldn’t have put up with the old lady, but she was a good cook. The first time she invited me for dinner was after I went to Mickey’s for her. She said, “If you get any skinnier, you might disappear altogether.”
Mama was working an extra shift, so I went. Pretty soon, I was going there all the time. I didn’t bother telling her I learned to cook when I was a kid.
When Mama went to art school, she never cared how late we ate, if we ate the same thing every night, or if we ate at all. Her brain ignored her stomach, and so did Daddy’s, but mine didn’t.
When I complained to Daddy, he laughed and said. “That’s why we have a refrigerator and stove, skinny girl. I better teach you to cook so you don’t starve.”
I decided I ought to get more than food for the work I was doing for the old lady. So, I said, “How come you don’t pay me? Don’t you have any money?”
She gave me one of her looks. “Haven’t you heard of doing a good deed for the sake of helping another person?”
“I probably already earned my way into heaven. But it might be a long time before I get there, and I could use some cash now.”
Lena looked out the window and tried to hide her smile.
“Well then,” she grumbled, “I better put you on retainer.”
“Retainer? What’s that?”
“It means I pay you something now, and if your work is satisfactory, you get more later.”
“Forget about later. What do I get now?”
“Twenty-five bucks.”
She dug around in her purse and handed over the money. I didn’t bother telling her I’d have taken ten.
Whenever I went to her place, I’d sneak a look at that photo on the beach and try to figure out why she looked so different. She reminded me of the silverware from Daddy’s family that Mama made me polish for the holidays. Mama stored it in soft cloth bags, but the silver still turned dull and looked neglected.
That’s how the old lady looked, but nothing would make her bright and shiny again.
LENA
CAMBRIDGE RESOURCES
When I was a kid, we lived in Watertown, and Lotta practically lived at our house. We’d beg my mother to make Dom and his friends take us when they went to Cambridge, and sometimes she did. We’d hang out near Harvard Square and get a Bartley’s burger or Bailey’s ice cream while the boys cruised around looking for somebody who’d buy them a six-pack or three back then.
Nowadays, boys aren’t the only ones looking for trouble. Headstrong girls like Kalayla did whatever they pleased. I wore out my brain trying to think of something that would keep her off the streets and away from that damn Clean Duds. I was afraid some lowlife might see her there and decide she’d be easy pickings.
Classes at the library were free, but Kalayla was too old for Story Time and too young for films or book discussion groups. I made a few calls about the summer crafts and sports programs and discovered most of them had a fee. Maureen didn’t have extra money, but I’d take care of that if Kalayla were willing to do something besides guard laundry.
The day was sunny and seventy-three degrees, so I got my coffee and was at Clean Duds before 10 a.m. Kalayla was reading a book with her feet propped up as usual.
She looked up and said, “Hey Lena, were you giving your legs a rest yesterday?”
“I was minding my own business, which you’d benefit from doing. You’re turning into a couch potato with no couch. Most kids would rather play sports than lounge in a boring place like this.”
Kalayla gave me a dirty look. “Sports? You mean, like, be on a team with a bunch of jerks?”
Wouldn’t you know she ruled out team sports before I could give her my sales pitch? No matter, she wouldn’t derail my train now that I got it going.
“You could play tennis,” I said. “If you were good enough, you could play singles. Singles, as in by yourself against one other person.”
“I know what singles is! Why’d I waste my time chasing a stupid ball around? Why don’t you suggest something interesting? If you had a gun hidden in one of your white rooms, you could teach me how to shoot.”
I took a deep breath, trying to stay calm. That girl had no idea how much she sounded like one of my twins, and she picked one thing I could teach her if I had a mind to, which I sure as hell did not.
Joey loved guns, and the twins begged to see them. A week didn’t go by without Joey unlocking the footlocker, lifting out one of his precious and caressing it like a lover.
He introduced the boys to shooting the day they turned eight, the age limit for the Highland Gun Club. They started with pistols like I did. Benchrest rifles came next, and when they were strong enough, shotguns. I didn’t care for the heavier guns, so I stuck with the pistol.
Joey pushed me to compete. “You can beat the ass off any of the women, Lena. We’d be the first husband and wife champions!”
I gave in, and we won both titles four years in a row. Joey was the only one I wanted to beat, and I never did.
There was no point in wasting more time in the Clean Duds oven. Kalayla vetoed sports and I was not teaching her to shoot.
When I turned and walked toward the door, Kalaya said, “Is it too hot in here today?”
The following day, I saw her across the street talking to one of the locals, Ray Ray Bingha, who was six feet five inches tall and had two hundred and fifty pounds of muscle. His dark-brown hair was in a ponytail that trailed four inches down his back, but nobody teased him about having a girly hairdo or the two gold earrings in his left ear.
You never saw Ray Ray without Thor, his enormous bullmastiff. You didn’t need a Beware of Dog sign to warn you that Thor would rip out your throat if Ray Ray gave the signal.
Ray Ray and I were on good terms, but there was no guarantee his patience would last if Kalayla got her mouth going. I beat it across that street as fast as my legs could.
“Ray Ray!” I called as I stopped at the curb to catch my breath.
“Well, Miss Lena,” he grinned. “I haven’t seen you in quite some time. I thought you might’ve dropped dead and been buried.”
“I’m not in the habit of trolling the streets like you, Ray Ray. Don’t worry. You’ll know when I die. My son, JJ, will hire a band and invite the whole city to celebrate! I came to warn you this girl has allergic fits when she gets close to dogs. You better keep Thor away from her.”
As usual, Kalayla shifted her mouth into high gear without thinking.
“Where’d you get such a dumb idea, Lena? I love dogs!”
“Whatever,” Ray Ray said, laughing. “I just explained to this little girl that Thor isn’t interested in being her friend.”
“I’m not a little girl, and I don’t want Thor for a friend ’cause he’d probably drool all over me!”
I swear I could have slapped that girl’s face!
Contrary to what she said, Kalayla reached out to pet Thor. Ray Ray’s soft “Don’t!” froze her hand mid-air.
“The only way Thor’d find you likable would be as an appetizer for his dinner. Don’t worry, Miss Lena. he won’t bother this funny little thing. She hasn’t got enough meat on her to make it worthwhile.”
With that, Ray Ray and Thor strolled down Mass. Ave.
Kalayla put her hands on her hips and stamped her foot. “Why’d you run over here, Lena? And why’d you tell that guy I’m allergic to dogs?”
“I must have dreamed it,” I said, taking her arm like I needed something to lean on. “I want you to help sort some books in my storage bin.”
I took deep breaths all the way home. That girl had no more sense than a bug, but covering her mouth with duck tape wouldn’t help. Ray Ray likely had more than one gun tucked away, and if Kalayla ran into him again and the subject came up, teaching her to shoot might give him a laugh.
I needed to consult with Lotta, but first, I had research to do.
***
Cambridge was a good-sized city, but it was like a woman’s handbag with different compartments of different sizes. Information about Kalayla’s family was tucked in one of them, and I knew how to find it.
The members of the Ladies Knitting Club were townies who took great pride in sharing their hoard of information. Not all the members were born in Cambridge, but they grew up nearby. They knew more than a person needed to about the rivalries, tragedies, and trivia of every family in town based on a combination of facts and gossip.
The group boasted it was open to new members, which was something of a joke because you had to know somebody who knew somebody to get in. I never was a knitter and didn’t plan on becoming one, but I wasn’t worried about being welcomed. I’d drop a few snippets about the Manero-Barzetti clan, most of which would be pure fabrication.
The ability to tell good tales while keeping family secrets was a highly prized skill in my family. When we were kids, Nana and Mama taught us to play one note and make it sound like the whole orchestra.
While the ladies dug in their knitting, I circled the room and admired their fine handiwork. I eventually remarked that a girl named Kalayla and her mama had moved in across the hall from me, and the ladies fell all over themselves to tell me what they knew.
Maureen’s husband, Jamal LeeRoyce, came from an established black family in a mixed-race Cambridge neighborhood. They were community-minded Protestants, especially Jamal’s mother, Lucinda. She ran a soup kitchen for their church and occasionally took in stray kids. She was active when it came to rights for blacks. In the days of forced busing, she argued it was a lose-lose situation, and if Judge Garrity took the time to visit Roxbury and South Boston, he’d understand that.
The ladies thought the younger son, Clarence, had mental problems as a kid but was an excellent auto mechanic. The older son, Jamal, was intelligent, good in sports, and went to UMass Boston on a scholarship. He’d died while drag-racing a few years ago.
When I said Maureen’s family must have helped her when her husband died, the ladies set me straight. What they told me was close to unbelievable, and I needed time to let it sink in before I went to see Lotta.
LENA
BEST FRIENDS
Carlotta Eccli had been my best friend forever. Her approach to life was straightforward, with no gray areas, and she thought my approach was incomprehensible. Lotta pointed out that I stayed married to a vicious bastard, refused to dye my hair, and insisted on wearing black, like a corpse, in search of a coffin. To top it off, I lived in a fourth-floor walk-up apartment even though I could afford a penthouse at the Ritz.
I could count on Lotta no matter what. In addition, she was a fabulous cook, so I invited myself to dinner that night. Her house was a half-mile walk from the apartment and helped me stay in shape. Even Lotta admitted I hadn’t loaded on fat like so many of our high school classmates.
Lotta’s house was in a Cambridge neighborhood that boasted yards with trees, shrubs, and lawns. Her neighbors were not pleased when she had a five-foot-high chain-link fence installed in her backyard. “Well,” she told them, “would you prefer dogs running free and shitting all over your lawn?” That was the last she heard from them on that subject.
Lotta redecorated on the spur of the moment, but nothing had changed since my previous visit. Her kitchen was black and white, the living room and dining room pale aqua and the furniture was a Scandinavian design from Form in Teak.
We were finishing the Coq au Vin and buttery noodles when I said, “Did I tell you I went to the last meeting of the Ladies Knitting Club?”
Lotta clanked her fork on her plate. “Now, why would you do something so outrageous and act like it’s normal? You do not knit, have never knitted, and will never knit. Besides, all they do is gossip.”
“That’s why I went. I’m trying to help a fatherless child and her hard-working, widowed mother. I needed to find out a few things. What’s for dessert?”
Lotta rolled her eyes. “Mocha squares drizzled with almond sauce. What were you so hot to find out?”
“The mama told me a story that smelled like dead fish, and her daughter is wandering around Cambridge like it’s her playground. You know how dangerous that can be.”
“Mother, daughter, dead fish? Lena, please explain in plain English.”
“Fine! Maureen is the mother, and Kalayla is her daughter. They moved into the apartment across the hall from me. When I asked Maureen about her family, she changed the subject so fast that my head spun. That seemed odd, so I asked the girl about her mama’s family.
“Kalayla told me the entire family died in an explosion at a party in Brighton before she was born. I don’t remember that. Do you?”
“A story like that would have been plastered on every TV station and the front page of The Globe, The Herald, and all the rags. We couldn’t have missed it!”
“We didn’t. Maureen was lying,” I said, taking a bite of mocha square.
“That’s ridiculous! Why would she?”
“I got the whole history. Maureen’s grandmother and mother moved from Belfast, Ireland, to South Boston to be with family when the grandfather died. Maureen’s mother moved to Brighton when she got married and that’s where Maureen grew up.
“Maureen was one of four children, the family star, a straight-A student, popular and beautiful with green eyes, red hair, and a movie actress figure. She was supposed to become a nurse and marry an Irish boy named Paul O’Brien, whose father owned a law business. At least, that was her mother’s plan.”
“Ha! We all know how those plans work out. Did Maureen suck it up and go along like you did?”
I gave her a dirty look. “No, she didn’t. She fell in love with a black boy from a Protestant family and married him!”
“Oh, my God!” Lotta’s mouth dropped open. She stood up, leaned over the table, and repeated, “Oh my God!”
I had to laugh.
“Right!” I said. “Maureen’s mother disowned her and hasn’t met her granddaughter! Can you believe that?”
Lotta flopped down in her chair. Such a thing was as unimaginable to her as it was to me. She and I came from close-knit Italian-Catholic families. No matter what we did, our families would never turn away from us. Lotta was twice divorced, didn’t want children, and had casual relationships with men, but her parents stood by her. She wasn’t the critical pawn in the family’s business as I had been.
“What a vicious woman!” Lotta said. “And the rest of the family went along with her! But why in hell did Maureen lie? You know as well as I do her daughter will find out, and Maureen will have hell to pay! That woman is a loony tune. Do not open the door if she comes knocking, and do not give her or her daughter another thought!”
I took a sip of coffee and set my cup down carefully. “Funny that you would say that. You never once turned your back on an abused or abandoned animal, even when it caused you a boatload of problems.”
Lotta drove her parents crazy, bringing stray or hurt animals home. She now owned the most respected and best-run animal shelter in Cambridge and the surrounding towns.
Lotta sighed. “It is not the same. Animals can’t help themselves. People can. You’ve got a burr in your side over this, and nothing I say will change your mind. How do you plan to help?”
“Maureen works at Eddie’s. When one of his regular girls quit, I asked him to put her on the days and give her a raise so she wouldn’t have to take cleaning jobs. Kalayla is a disaster waiting to happen, and I have no idea what to do.”
We cleared the table and loaded the dishwasher. Finally, Lotta said, “I’ll make fresh coffee. Tell me what you tried that didn’t work.”
Relief flooded me. “Kalayla refuses to play sports and has no interest in art or any crafts. She hangs out at Clean Duds or roams around alone.”
“That’s good, not good at all.”
While Lotta continued puttering, I settled into a living room chair. Lotta always thought about every possibility before she did anything. In the late 1940s, girls didn’t leave their marriage via a back door, but Lotta did. When she caved into family pressure and married, she convinced her boyfriend they should have a civil ceremony at Watertown City Hall. She knew the Catholic Church didn’t recognize marriages performed by a Justice of the Peace.
Her parents were furious and insisted that she and Stan have a proper wedding, but Lotta was already maneuvering out that back door. Stan’s idea of a good time was slapping her around, and she wasn’t about to put up with that. Her younger brother, Mattwo, had a heavyweight influence in her family, and Lotta went to him for help. He convinced Stan that an annulment would be his best option.
Two years later, Lotta married Jeff Procopio in a civil ceremony. In less than a month, she decided Jeff’s romantic gifts and sappy notes were an irritation rather than a blessing. Mattwo again came to her rescue, and Jeff departed. No one in Lotta’s family mentioned marriage to her again.
I heard the soft hum of the dishwasher. Lotta handed me a coffee mug, flopped on the sofa, and curled her legs under her.
“Maybe we’ll get lucky and find out the girl has as much sense as a cat or a dog,” she said.
I laughed, “So, what do you think?”
Lotta stared at me for a full minute before saying, “You won’t like the idea, but I think Matty’s Way is worth a try. Going there worked for your twins; no sane person would have said they were easy to control.”
I came close to spilling my coffee. What was I thinking? Of course, Lotta would suggest Matty’s Way.
Lotta’s father started Matty’s Way as a dojo for judo and karate in the 1920s. When he retired, Lotta’s brother, Mattwo, took over and added aerobic and strength training classes. His son, Lotta’s nephew, Rico, was next in line to run the gym.

ESSENTIAL INFORMATION FOR THE READER
Before I wrote Kalayla, I thought writers who said their characters talked to them were exaggerating, hallucinating, or fibbing. I found out they weren’t when it happened to me. Having the characters in my head was aggravating and exhausting. I needed a break, and although I knew I hadn’t resolved all the characters’ issues, I felt as if I’d done my best. I assumed that ending and publishing the book would be acceptable.
I was wrong. I didn’t understand that I had entered into a covenant with the characters. I didn’t realize they would feel abandoned and betrayed because I hadn’t finished telling their stories. I didn’t expect their response to be insistent and demanding.
The fact of the matter was I loved the characters, related to their struggles, and hadn’t meant to disappoint them. So, I recommitted, fully aware that they preferred late-night conversations, and sleepless nights would follow. I listened attentively and researched topics of concern to them. Outspoken characters continued to speak their minds, and to my delight, previously voiceless characters revealed their complicated and tangled backgrounds. 
I concluded I couldn’t simply write a sequel to Kalayla. I had to rewrite the story and incorporate what I learned, which I did in Kalayla Unraveling Tangles. The book was a fascinating and joyous collaboration that showcases the complexity of the characters’ lives. I thank my family and friends, who encouraged me to persevere, and I am grateful the characters are satisfied and comfortingly silent.
Exploring the dynamics in Kalayla’s extended family encouraged me to think about my life’s tangles and pose a question for myself and the readers. How do we unravel our tangles with kindness and help ourselves and others find a constructive way forward?

UNRAVELING TANGLES
KALAYLA’S GREAT GRANDPARENTS
PRELUDE
BELFAST, IRELAND, 1960
The girl tucked her chair against the right side of the bed, her ear almost touching the lips of her father’s disfigured face. His voice was hoarse, barely audible, each word a painful effort, “I’m done,” Colin Doyle said, gasping for breath.
His daughter, Colleen, knew he would say more if he could. She waited, as she’d been waiting for six endless days.
Colleen had been afraid long before the lads carried her broken father home. Time and time again, she heard her mother, Mary Margaret, warn him to be cautious and to watch his words. Colleen had experience skirting Belfast’s danger, and she knew her mother was right. They lived among enemies whose smiling faces could turn to snarls with the slightest provocation. Despite her mother’s pleas, the daredevil side of Colin refused to reign in its cockiness.
Colin was a magician with machines, crooning to them softly, fixing any broken or improperly balanced. He believed his talent protected him. The Protestant bosses at the linen factory called Colin the devil Taig—as if his ability had its source in hell. Worse than that, Colin and Mary Margaret were Catholics in a sea of Protestant workers, any one of whom might repeat Colin’s arrogant taunts to the B Specials, the part-time constable police force in Northern Ireland.
Everyone knew Colin Doyle was on the list of suspected IRA members. He was a burly-brash man who danced on the narrowest of ledges as if he considered a Catholic taunting the B Specials a schoolyard game.
“No worries,” he’d tell Mary Margaret, pulling her close. “They’ll not be so foolish as to come after me.”
But one night six days ago, they saw the chance and did. Colin had gone with the neighborhood lads to the Horse Trough Pub, but when the others left, Colin waved them off. He’d won a few pence arm wrestling and would stay on to see if his luck would hold.
In the wee hours, Mary Margaret sent word that her husband hadn’t come home. The lads went searching and brought what was left of Colin back to her and Colleen. “IRA scum” was smeared in the blood on her husband’s chest, his mangled body a showpiece of brutality.
Mary Margaret knew what she had to do. Colleen would be ten soon, the age when children went to work in the linen factory. Mary Margaret’s childless sister and husband lived in South Boston in the United States, and they offered Mary Margaret and Colleen a place to live. Mary Margaret had no other choice. She couldn’t pay the rent, and it would be too dangerous for any friend or relative to take them in. They would stay in Belfast until after Colin had a proper Catholic burial.
Mary Margaret stowed her grief in her apron pocket and went to the linen factory every day from six a.m. to nine p.m. as Colin would expect her to.
While her mother worked, Colleen sat alone beside the body that had been her father. She knew he would expect her to be brave, but every sound was terrifying. When they found out Colin wasn’t dead, would they come to finish their work and they kill her, too? Or would they use her as their whore the way the neighborhood girls said they did if they caught you alone?
Later, when Colleen took her da bread and milk for his noontime meal, he took a ragged breath and said, “No food, no water. Our secret.”
Colleen closed her eyes and dug her nails into her clenched fists. She understood it had to be their secret. Her mother would never allow Colin to starve himself. She’d say it was a mortal sin, and the timing and manner of his death was God’s choice, not his.
Her da would scoff at that idea. Although Colin went with Mary Margaret and Colleen to mass every Sunday and on Holy Days of Obligation, he mocked church teachings with the same regularity. He told his daughter that sins were nothing more than a deck of cards in a game of make-believe. Colleen listened wide-eyed, trusting the handsome man who carried her on his shoulders, taught her to sing, spun bedtime stories of goblins, fairies, and dragons, and knew everything.
The battered body beside her bore no resemblance to that Da, but Colleen heard the echo of his tenor’s lilt in the ragged voice, and that was enough for her. She could do what he wanted. After all, she was nine years old, the miracle child, the one of five who lived. Three sisters died before she was born, and one brother after. Mum said the factory’s damp, foul air and ever-present coughing sickness made her womb unhealthy. Colleen had been strong enough to survive, and she was strong enough to set her father free to sing again.
SOUTH BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS/SOUTHIE
Colleen hated Southie more than she hated Belfast. The landscape in Belfast had been familiar, the tension as commonplace as the insults hurled by Catholic and Protestant kids across divided streets. The girl’s fear was monotonous and ever-present.
The landscape in Southie was unknown, a deafening source of terror. Noise from planes, trains, sirens, horns, and trolleys mingled with shouting adults and crying children. Teenage gangs wandered without defined boundaries. Music blared from their transistor radios and competed with record players from the Project’s open windows. Any step might trigger an invisible booby trap. The girl’s fear was intense and ever-present.
Her aunt’s and her uncle’s flat was in a Catholic enclave in the Old Dominion Housing projects, three-story brick buildings near a traffic circle and park. Neighborhood kids invited Colleen to go adventuring, but what if they were like her da, whose willingness to take risks had gotten him killed? When they grew tired of her excuses and stopped asking, she didn’t care. Colleen stayed observant, alert, and close to home.
Colleen’s mother wasn’t willing to settle for life in a housing project. Her sister was satisfied to be a part-time seamstress and pleased that her husband had a steady job as a postal worker. She didn’t have a daughter to spur her to a better life.
If Colin had listened to Mary Margaret, they would have moved to Cork or Dublin before Colleen turned three. But he didn’t, and she was left to deal with the consequences of his myopic vision. She’d had her fill of factory work and knew she could sell her domestic skills.
City Point was less than a two-mile walk from the Old Dominion projects but light years away in gentility and prosperity, with mansion-like houses beacons beckoning to a better life. With a subtle hint of arrogance, Mary Margaret spun a tale about her previous employment to the mistress of the grandest house, who hired her on the spot. The mistress could casually brag that she’d hired a household staff manager recently employed by the royal family to maintain their Belfast residence.
Mary Margaret told Colleen that night, “I’ll learn all I can about gentry life. God helped us get this far, Colleen. The rest is up to us.”
Colleen didn’t brag or preen in front of the other girls in the ensuing years. She made the honor roll but didn’t brown-nose the teachers. She helped classmates who struggled with math or English. Colleen’s aunt and uncle became surrogate parents. Her aunt enjoyed sewing school clothes for her, and when Colleen was old enough to attend Catholic mixers in Boston, her aunt added flattering tucks, ruffles, and ribbons. Colleen’s uncle was a quiet, unassuming man.
Colleen realized she couldn’t marry anyone mercurial like her da, whose firecracker mouth got him murdered. She needed a steady, solid man to raise a family without fear.
She was nearly eighteen when she met Kevin O’Rourke, an auto mechanic saving to buy a garage or two if things went as he planned. Kevin was down-to-earth and safe. He wanted three or four children and a home to welcome them and their friends. Colleen could build a life with him, and he wouldn’t shatter it.
SUMMER 1999
LENA MANERO BARZETTI
THAT GIRL
I’m not one of those old biddies who minds other people’s business instead of her own. But, there are some people it is impossible to ignore, and that girl, Kalayla, was one of them.
The first time I saw Kalayla was mid-June last year. I was walking back from Mickey’s Market on one of those perfect sunny days that made you believe you could live happily ever after. The National Scoop headline, “Princess Diana’s Death Revealed as Hoax,” made the same promise.
Kalayla was ahead of me, half swaggering, half strutting in a way so familiar I thought I must know her. I ruminated on it until I realized my twins walked like that when they were showing off, which was pretty much from the minute they got up until they went to bed.
How often had I seen those two boys swagger, strut, or taunt each other? Mikie would dare Jimmy, “Bet it takes you more than 20 seconds to shimmy up that streetlight.” Jimmy would dare Mikie, “Bet you can’t get five bucks panhandling between here and home.” Off they’d go, running, laughing, shoving and punching.
The blast from a horn jolted me out of daydreaming, or I’d have bumped right into Kalayla. She was staring into Hanson’s Book Store window, and her saucer-sized green eyes briefly glanced my way.
I pegged Kalayla as a Cambridge street kid scraping her way from one meal to the next, an old hand at trash picking and layering up with everything she found. That day, she wore three layers on top with a mishmash of colors and designs; a rope held up the baggy capri-length pants that would have been shorts on someone taller. A beat-up blue-and-red baseball cap with the brim turned backward squashed down her kinky orange-brown curls. She was an inch or two shorter than my five feet two inches, and I couldn’t tell how old she was. Most teenage girls wanted to show off their bodies, but Kalayla didn’t.
After that, I saw Kalayla everywhere I went. She was always by herself, and I wondered why. The only way my four boys were alone was if they were going to or coming from someplace where other kids were hanging out. Even my boy Mark, who was always getting in fights, had plenty of friends. If I were that girl’s mama, the fact she was alone so much would have worried me.
***
About two weeks later, I was walking back from buying milk and eggs at Mickey’s Market when I saw Kalayla talking to Maureen, the red-headed woman who waited tables at Eddie’s Eatery. Eddie’s was across from my apartment building, and sometimes I stopped by to chat. Maureen was friendly and cheerful but didn’t blab personal stuff like some folks. Eddie told me she was a widow with a daughter.
I watched Maureen kiss her on the forehead and go into Eddie’s. The girl had the same huge green eyes and delicate features Maureen did. Maureen’s skin was ivory, and the girl’s was light chocolate, but she had to be her daughter. She crossed the street and went into my apartment building. I hurried to see where she was going, but she had disappeared when I arrived.
I didn’t just live in the building. I owned it and the building where Eddie’s was located. They were the first properties Joey and I bought after we married, and our families solidified their business partnership by forming Manzetti Properties. Joey didn’t turn out to be much of a husband, but his family knew all the angles when it came to rehab and construction, and my family was skillful and shrewd at buying and marketing real estate.
My job was to locate vacant buildings or properties the owner was interested in offloading quickly. I kept my eye out for local contractors. It was good public relations to involve them in small tear-downs or rehabs and leave the big jobs to Joey’s crews. My office was at our corporate headquarters, and I still worked one or two days a week.
My brother Dominic was a financial wizard who’d been pretending to train his son and daughter to take over for him for the last three years. When I asked Dom if he knew anything about the girl and her mother, he laughed and said, “Have you been walking around with your eyes closed, Lena? Those two moved in across the hall from you.”
Well, I never! When they moved in, I must have been volunteering at Helping Hands Shelter for Women, having supper at Dom’s, or out with my best friend, Carlotta. That girl didn’t come across as if she wanted to keep a low profile, but Voles hunkered down underground would have gotten my attention faster than those two.
A few days later, I saw Kalayla on our landing, staring out the window like a lost soul, and it wrenched my heart. I’d looked out the window many times and wished I’d see Jimmy or Mikie strutting down the street. But no amount of wishing could bring them back from the dead. And no amount of wishing changed the fact that the girl reminded me of them. When we finally did speak, it was no surprise the first thing out of her mouth was a smart-assed comment, like my twins would have made.
When my boys were growing up, Lotta repeatedly told me to wash the twins’ mouths with soap. She never raised kids, or she would have known you can’t stick a bar of soap into a child’s mouth, no matter how tempted you might be.
KALAYLA LEEROYCE
THE OLD LADY
That crabby old lady would swear I never paid attention to a word she said, but she’d be wrong. Her name was Lena Barzetti, and I called her crabby ’cause that’s what she was ninety-five percent of the time. She was seventy-two years old, and boy, did she look it. I was exploring the new neighborhood that summer and got to know her.
It didn’t get dark until late, so I could be out without flipping Mama out. Our building was on a corner with a light, about halfway between Harvard Square and Arlington. Massachusetts Avenue had sidewalks. I could walk on one side of the street until I got bored, then cross the street and walk back on the other.
I liked meeting people who were walking their dogs. Pets weren’t allowed in our building. I told Mama it’d be easy to sneak in a dog or cat, but she lectured me about not doing anything to get us kicked out of the apartment—as if I would!
Second Time Clothes, White’s Fruits and Vegetables, and Mickey’s Market were within a few blocks. You could get your nails or toes done at Tammy’s Tips or your hair straightened at Creative Clips. Magneson’s Flower Shop owners were friendly, but my favorite place was Clean Duds Laundromat.
Regulars there knew better than to go on an errand while their laundry was in the washer or dryer. I earned an easy buck sitting with my feet propped up on the windowsill and reading a book like I owned the place. I kept an eye out for anybody with an empty basket or bag who acted like they were lost while they checked the place out. I’d give them a big smile and say, “You need help?” That cleared out the shifty types pretty fast.
***
One day, when I was standing on the landing between the third and fourth floors of the apartment building, staring out the window and planning my afternoon, I heard slow footsteps coming up the stairs. That was when I met old lady Lena.
The weird thing was she only wore black. Her dress, socks, and shoes were all black like she worked at a funeral home, and that was her uniform. She was dragging a couple of duffle bags. If she collapsed, I’d be stuck dialing 911.
She stopped when she got to the landing, and I saw that the bags were full of black clothes. She must’ve come from Clean Duds. She had to be dumber than dumb to live on the fourth floor of a building with no elevator. Besides, anybody smart would’ve taken small loads instead of everything they owned.
If I felt like starting a conversation—which I didn’t—I might’ve pointed that out.
The old lady said, “Little girl, if you don’t have anything to do, I can give you some work.”
Dumber than dumb, like I thought, right?
“If it looks to you like I’m hanging out here waiting for a job, you need glasses. And I’m not a little girl. I’m twelve years old.”
She stared at me long and hard. “Well, maybe you want to be an architect, and you’re staring at those buildings to get ideas. Good view from up here.”
I gotta say that was worth a laugh. “Nah,” I said, “I’m just planning my day.”
“Then how about helping me carry this laundry?”
“My mama told me not to talk to strangers or carry laundry for them. A good-looking girl like me has to be real careful.”
She stared longer and harder this time. Anybody could see I wouldn’t be crowned queen of the apartment building, even competing against people like her. Maybe her eyesight was lousy.
“Well,” she said, “I’m interested in your muscles, not your looks or mouth. I’ll give you a Coke for pay.”
“I don’t like Coke. I’ll take a root beer.”
“All kids like Coke, and I don’t have root beer. I have lemons, water, and sugar to make lemonade. I can throw in a few cookies. Will that satisfy you?”
“What kind of cookies?”
She rolled her eyes like she couldn’t believe I’d ask that, but I wasn’t lugging laundry for plain old sugar cookies.
“Peanut butter—fresh made.”
“Fine!” I said, heaving one bag over each shoulder.
Her apartment was the same as ours, but it was almost empty. Every wall was white, and there was nothing, not one thing, on them. The window shades and the rug in front of the sofa were white. The couch and chair were white. Everybody knew you’d have to wash or clean all that white every other day. Nobody but a rich person could afford that, and she sure didn’t look rich.
She said, “Don’t stand there gawking. Put the laundry bags in the closet in the spare room.”
That’d be my bedroom at home, but I couldn’t tell what it was for her. The walls, window shades, and rug in the middle of the room were all white. A small wooden table and a straight-back chair were near the window. Maybe she lived someplace else and came here ’cause she liked Clean Duds. I dumped the bags on the floor in the closet but felt like I’d messed things up.
She was in the kitchen mixing the lemonade, and I decided I better find out how crazy she was before I had any. So, I said, “Do you live in a monastery and just keep this place to store stuff?”
She gave me a big-time stare and said, “That smart mouth must get you in trouble at school. What would you know about a monastery?”
“I read a book that said the walls are white, and they give you a chair, a bed, an extra robe, a pair of shoes, and a box to store them.”
“Is that a fact? So, you read books?”
“Yeah. What of it? You never met a kid who reads books?” Why wasn’t she asking me the usual stupid adult questions like how I was doing in school and how many brothers and sisters I had?
“That would be an example of the mouth I was talking about. I’ve got a lot of books you could look at if you wanted to.”
Why’d she think I’d want to read her crummy old books? I thought about leaving until she brought out the peanut butter cookies. I tasted one and decided to stay long enough to eat a few.
“You can call me Lena,” she said. “And I suppose you have a name.”
Did she think my parents named me Girl like some jerks named their dog Dog?
“Sure, I got a name. It’s Kalayla.”
“Ka lay la,” she repeated slowly. “That’s unusual and pretty. Is it a family name?”
“Nah. My mama thought it up. She’s smart about some things.”
I drank a lot of lemonade that summer ’cause the old lady asked me for help every five minutes. Sometimes, she annoyed me so much I wanted to spit, but I wasn’t giving up free lemonade and cookies.
I didn’t mind ’cause Mama wasn’t home much. We got a car last year, and she cleaned houses before her four-nine shift at Eddie’s. Standing on the landing, I could watch her serving customers or clearing tables. Sometimes, I’d go over to hang out and have a snack.
Mama attended classes or did art projects when Daddy was alive instead of working. She didn’t have a studio now. Even if we had room for one, she was too busy working.

When summer came, Mama decided we should spend more time together and have Sunday morning talks. We’d sit at the kitchen table while she drank coffee, and I’d fix whatever I felt like eating. Mostly, Mama asked me questions, and I tried not to lie too much. Sometimes, I had to ’cause she was hyper-nervous about what I was doing and where I was going.
This morning, she said, “Are you going to the library today?”
I never told her the library was closed on Sundays during the summer, so I said, “Haven’t made plans yet, Mama. Is there something you want me to do?”
“Well, no, but if you’re going out, you might want to change your clothes.”
Cow turds! Even the old lady didn’t bug me about how I dressed, and she bugged me about plenty of stuff. Someday, I might try going naked to see if Mama liked that better!
Sometimes, Mama got going on how important family was, which was weird ’cause her family died in a gas explosion, so I never met them. Mama seemed nervous when we visited Daddy’s family, so I decided she liked talking about family more than being with it.
After Daddy died, his brother, Clarence, thought he’d do us a big favor and drop by to see us. He bragged about how good he was at getting good car deals and offered to find one for us. Clarence always made her nervous, so when she asked me what I thought, I said, “He’ll get us a car when he gets a real job.”
“Layla, I wish you wouldn’t say things like that about Clarence.”
“It’s the truth, so why shouldn’t I say it?”
“He’s your uncle, and you should be respectful.”
“I am respectful. I never called him a butthole to his face, did I?”
Mama sighed like she wished I’d shut my mouth, but she knew I wouldn’t.
For once, Clarence did what he said. He found a blue Ford with eighty thousand miles and not too many scrapes and dents. He kept bragging about how it had a fine American engine, and he had detailed it himself. I got sick of hearing that, so I said, “Wow! You mean you did something besides sit on your butt?” I took off before he could slap me. Mama started cleaning houses after we got the car.
***
My grandparents lived near Inman Square in Cambridge. After Daddy died, Grandma told everyone that Mama was exhausted and needed to rest, so we stayed with them. That was a bunch of bull. Mama wasn’t exhausted. She had a nervous breakdown. Grandma knew it; I knew it, and so did everybody else.
Staying with them would’ve been okay, except they dragged me to church. I wanted to tell Grandma they should take Clarence instead of me, but she would’ve said I was rude.
When Mama finally got back to normal, she got a job at Eddie’s, and we moved to a smaller apartment. Mama said decorating the apartment would be her art project, but everybody knew fixing up an apartment wasn’t the same as having a studio.
It was kind of funny, but once we moved to the new apartment, the person I saw the most was the old lady. She liked Clean Duds and dropped by every day with her iced coffee. I decided her life had to be pretty boring if all she had to do was take up my valuable time.
She’d pull up a chair and say something like, “Too hot to be out,” when it was just as hot inside as it was out. Clean Duds had a couple of standing fans chained to the wall, but all they did was blow around hot air and make a lot of noise.
Mama told me that black absorbs the most heat of any color. So, on one of those broiling days, I said, “If you’re so hot, why are you wearing black?”
She gave me the icy stare routine. “What color I wear and why I wear it is no business of yours!”
Fine! It would serve her right if she fried!
When the old lady wanted me to do stuff, she’d ask if I wanted to earn a Coke. That turned into a joke, and I’d say, “I’ll have a vanilla Coke float with chocolate ice cream, thanks.”
I got used to the whiteness in her apartment, and in a way, I kind of liked it. It was like a blank page, and you could decorate it any way you wanted. A small bookcase in the corner of the living room had photos of some boys. Mama had pictures of her, me, and Daddy everywhere, but Lena’s place wasn’t normal like ours.
One of the photos was of a beautiful woman standing in water a little above her ankles at the ocean. Her dark-brown hair was blowing around her shoulders, and the wind whipped her dress so you could see her legs. Two little boys were building a sand fort on the shore.
I pointed at the photo and said, “Is that a friend of yours?”
“A friend? That’s me you’re looking at, Kalayla, in my younger days.”
I covered my mouth to keep from snorting. I almost said, “Yeah, a couple hundred years ago,” but I already had her lecture on being polite memorized.
In another photo, the same woman held the two little boys to keep them from squirming away. Two older boys stood straight as statues beside them.
“Are those your kids? How come I never see them here?”
The old lady didn’t say anything for so long that I thought she might’ve gone deaf. Finally, she said, “I had four sons, and those photos were taken when they were little. You better go home, Kalayla. Your mama’s likely waiting.”

THE MAMA
That girl was sticking her nose into places she shouldn’t, like asking me about my boys. What good would come of me telling her two of them were dead, that I didn’t know if the third was living, and the fourth was a big-shot businessman who thought I was as desirable a mother as a field of poison ivy.
I decided I better get to know Kalayla’s mother. The fact I’d done a lousy job raising my boys meant I could give her plenty of good advice on what not to do.
I bagged a batch of Lotta’s cookies the following Sunday afternoon and went to Maureen’s. When she answered my knock, her smile was genuine, “Lena! I’m so glad it’s you! Please come in. Kalayla’s at the library; she’ll be sorry she missed you. I hope you’ll like what I’ve done to the apartment. I’m an artist, well, not a real artist. I mean, I’ve never earned any money with my art. Oh, do come in!” Maureen asked Dom if she could choose wall colors and do the painting herself. Of course, he said yes because he wouldn’t need to pay our painting crew. Dom’s knee-jerk reaction was to pinch every penny, nickel, dime, and quarter any way he could. The joke was that he didn’t know how much Maureen loved color! The entire apartment would have to be repainted when she moved out, and Dom would be on his high horse about that!
The wall colors reminded me of tropical fish with their brilliant colors. Two of the kitchen walls were yellow, and two were orange. The cushions, curtains, and wall decorations were a mixture of stripes, polka dots, and geometric shapes in yellow, orange, green, and white.
“Maureen, I don’t know what to say except what you’ve done is just plain wonderful!”
“Oh! I’m so relieved you like it. When Layla told me your apartment was all white, I was afraid you might ask us to repaint every room.”
“The house I lived in before I moved here was full of color. You should consider being a home decorator instead of waiting on tables and cleaning houses.”
“Oh, I’d love that, but I don’t have any formal training or experience, and I don’t have a college degree. I started on one, but—.”
If Maureen had gone on instead of stopping abruptly, I might have found out more, but instead, she gave me a tour of the apartment. Every room was unique, and her creativity was unmistakable.
When Maureen told me Kalayla was at the library on a Sunday afternoon in July, I knew I’d come just in time. I decided to get to know her before pointing out that her daughter was prone to altering the truth when it suited her.
After we settled in the living room with coffee and Lotta’s cookies, Maureen started talking again.
“I’m so glad you came, Lena. I can’t chat when I’m working. I wouldn’t want Eddie to think I was wasting time.”
“Don’t you worry about Eddie. He’d cut you some slack. Is this your first job?”
“Oh dear, is it that obvious? I didn’t work when Jamal was alive. I enrolled at Rhode Island School of Design as a part-time student, and took one or two classes each semester. It was taking forever, but I loved it. Our apartment was big enough that I had a studio, and after I had Kalayla, I put her crib there and later her pack ’n-play.
“When she started crawling, she was so quiet that I’d lose track of her. One day, I found her in the kitchen with everything from the bottom cupboards strewn on the floor. Jamal put on baby-proof cupboard locks and gates across the doorways. That worked until she figured out how to climb over them.
“When Jamal died, my life changed completely.”
I took a sip of coffee and waited for Maureen to go on, but she’d run out of steam. She fiddled with the handle of her mug until I said, “Your family must have been a big help when your husband died.”
Stricken was the only way to describe Maureen’s expression, and I knew I’d stumbled onto a right big sore spot.
“My family? No, they didn’t help, but my in-laws were good to us. Lucina and Harmon would have helped us move, and Jamal’s brother, Clarence, would have, too, but I wasn’t sure if that would cause problems.”
I didn’t bother asking why Maureen thought having Jamal’s family move them in might be a problem. It was 1999, but the idea of whites and blacks getting together still rubbed some folks the wrong way. It wouldn’t have bothered me, but Maureen might’ve found out the hard way that not everybody felt like I did. You could never tell when bigotry would come around the corner and hit you in the face.
Uncle Clarence must be the black guy I’d seen who stopped in and left about ten minutes later. When it came to helping, you’d think an uncle would do more than a drive-by on the way to somewhere else.
Before I could say anything, Maureen said, “Kalayla told me she sees you at Clean Duds. I’m glad I have the chance to ask you. She’s not getting into any trouble, is she? I mean, like hanging out with the wrong kids?”
Huh! I wished Kalayla had friends, and her mama was afraid she’d find the wrong ones!
“As far as I can tell, she doesn’t hang out with anyone.”
“That’s a relief. Kalayla told me you have four boys. I bet they were a handful! I’m having a hard time with one girl. You must be so glad they’re all grown. How are they doing?”
I admit that stopped me. Everybody knew about my family, and I never had to explain why, when, or how things happened to my boys or my husband.
I could have told Maureen my twins joined the Marines during the anti-war protests. I could have told her my second son, Mark, had disappeared from the face of the earth about fifteen years ago, and I didn’t know if he was alive. I could have told her I worried that my oldest boy, JJ, had become a clone of his dad, which was the worst thing he could have done.
Eventually, I said, “My oldest, JJ, runs the construction side of our family business. My second boy, Mark, moved out West. I’m not sure where he is or what he’s doing. The twins, Jimmy and Mikie, were the youngest. They were killed in Vietnam less than a year after their dad died.”
The color drained from Maureen’s face.
“How awful!” she said. “Now I understand why you wear black. Oh dear, that didn’t come out right. I just meant I’m so sorry.”
Yeah, everybody was sorry, especially me.
LATER IN THE DAY
Talking to Maureen made me think about Joey, how he loved high living and being the top man, how he bragged that his boys were like him, and I hoped they weren’t.
Joey said acting out was healthy for boys because they needed to prove themselves. He said the trouble they got into was good, harmless fun. I believed him until I realized not all the fun was harmless.
I was sure Mark was doing fine in school until I got calls saying he wasn’t.
“Mrs. Barzetti? This is John DiSilva, the principal at Mark’s school. I’m calling about an incident at lunch today. Mark smashed another kid’s piece of pie in his face.”
I knew Mark had a temper, but I’d never seen it get out of hand. Joey told me all boys fight with their brothers and that I should ignore it. So I did, but picking a fight outside the family was different.
“My Mark?” I said. “That doesn’t make sense. You must have him mixed up with some other boy.”
“I don’t think so, Mrs. Barzetti. He’s sitting right here in my office. You can ask him yourself.”
There was no doubt it was Mark’s voice saying: “Yeah, Ma, I ate the lunch you made me. I wasn’t going to eat his pie. But the kid is an asshole and does stuff that aggravates me, like giving me looks. Today, he bragged that he had a steak sandwich and cherry pie. I got sick of it. You should have seen him with cherries dripping down his face. I hope he gets a beating for ruining his shirt.”
“Mark! Shame on you! That’s not …”
“Ma, listen, okay? Dad wouldn’t put up with that, so why should I?”
“Don’t tell me what your dad would do! We’re talking about what you did!”
“Ma, I know. I promise I won’t do it again. Mr. D. wants to talk to you.”
Mark said he wouldn’t do it again, but he made a lot of promises he never kept. Nothing was ever his fault, and fighting over aggravations became the story of his life.
“I’m trying, Ma,” he’d tell me, and maybe he did.
Mark never had anybody watching his back like the twins did for each other. When JJ was four, and Mark was three, Joey told JJ to toughen up his younger brother. JJ used Mark as a punching bag. At first, Mark came to me for protection, but Joey called him a mama’s boy. That was far worse than anything JJ did to him.
JJ and his father were over six feet, and the twins were six feet by the time they turned fourteen. Joey rubbed it in by nicknaming Mark “Shrimp.”
I never got calls about the twins getting into fights, but they found other ways of getting into trouble. On their first day in kindergarten, the principal suspended them from the school bus for three days for teaching the other boys to play poker, which the school considered gambling.
I told Joey we should make them walk to school as a punishment. He laughed, “Why should they walk? They’re chips off the old block. Don’t worry, Lena. I’ll talk to them. The next time, they’ll be smart enough to hide the damn cards and not to admit anything. If you want to keep that fancy car I gave you, you’ll drive them to school until they can ride the bus.”
So I did.
They were eight when I grounded Jimmy for forgetting a chore, and they informed me they now had a punishment sharing agreement. When I told them I’d never heard of such a thing, Mikie said, “Yeah, Ma, that’s because we just invented it.”
“Your turn,” Jimmy would say, and Mikie would take the punishment for something his brother had done. It nearly drove me crazy.
When I tried punishing both for something one of them had done, they cocked their heads, gave me their lopsided grins, and said together, “Ahh, Ma, that’s not fair!” They were constantly whispering, planning, and getting smarter.
The day Mikie brought a brand-new backpack home, I said, “Where’d you get that? You didn’t steal it, did you?”
They laughed hysterically, and Mikie said, “Ma, we’d be lousy thieves, but we’re the best at working angles. Look at all the cool pockets. This one is much better than my old one.”
The twins hid behind a flow of fast talk and excuses, Joey style. Of course, their father backed them up. “If they’re smart enough to get it, they can keep it. Learning to skate on thin ice without falling in is good for them.”
When they reached 7th grade, I stopped telling them to return things like a leather jacket, a signed baseball, or a camera.
Even Joey couldn’t drive a wedge between them. When Mikie wrecked his bike, they made do with one, taking turns riding on the handlebars and giving me heartburn. Joey would have bought Mikie any bike he wanted, but they were happy sharing.
When the twins turned sixteen, Joey said he’d buy each of them a car. Mikie and Jimmy huddled, discussing his offer, and told Joey one car would be enough. They went to every car showroom within biking distance, spent hours studying brochures, and debated the pros and cons of every model.
When Joey offered them his advice, they said, “We got it covered, Dad, thanks anyway.”
They agreed on a Shelby Mustang GT 500, and naturally, Joey got a good deal with extras thrown in. Mikie won the buck up over color, choosing dark moss green, and Jimmy picked the black leather upholstery.
They named the car Miss Clementine, and one or both were always polishing her. When Joey said Clementine was a ridiculous name for a car, they walked out the door and called, “Hey Ma, we’re taking sweet Miss Clementine for a ride.”
They were smart enough never to push Joey too far, and they got around me with smiles, sweet talk, and what I believed were good intentions. They explained their behavior with the most favorable interpretation, and all I could do was hope they were telling the truth.
When they gave me a dozen roses for my birthday, a purple silk scarf for Christmas, or a three-pound box of candy for Mother’s Day, I asked where they got the money.
“We run errands, rake leaves, and shovel snow to help people out, Ma. You ought to be proud of how helpful we are!”
We named our firstborn Joseph John Barzetti, Jr. after Joey. Everybody called him JJ. He worshipped his dad, followed Joey around, and listened to everything his father told him. I never got calls about his behavior.
I was certain Kalayla’s mama did not intend for her to run. I was never a young widow working two jobs and trying to keep track of a twelve-year-old daughter, but I knew that keeping track of kids was like chasing marbles going downhill. They kept on rolling, and you kept on running.
Somebody had to help Maureen. I didn’t see anybody volunteering, which left it up to me.
KALAYLA
HELPING THE OLD LADY
Old lady Lena was always sticking her nose in my business. That made me mad ’cause it reminded me how that jerk, Clarence, tried to butt into my life when Mama and I stayed with Grandma and Grandpa after Daddy died.
It took Grandma about fifteen seconds to enroll me in a school near them. On my second day, I was standing in the hall near my classroom when a fat-assed girl bumped into me.
“Hey, new kid,” she said. “I heard your grandma told you to pass for black so you could get into a fancy private school next year. Right?”
I could’ve slammed my fist into her fat face, but I didn’t. I could’ve asked her if she ate cow turds for breakfast, but I didn’t. The bell rang, and I ducked into class without saying anything. I knew better than to make trouble at school, and I was used to comments from butthole kids.
When Uncle Clarence asked me how I liked the school, I made the mistake of telling him what the kid said.
He cracked up laughing. “If you ever decide to pass, Kalayla, pass for white. You’ll be a beauty like your mama. A passel of dudes would pay plenty to get their hands on her creamy white skin. Your skin isn’t white, but it sure is a sweet chocolate!” He was still laughing when he went out the front door.
Clarence’s mouth was worse than mine, but if I told Mama that, she would’ve said, “Clarence is your only uncle. You should treat him with respect.”
I’d rather have no uncle than a turd like him, but if I said that, Mama would make me sit in the corner facing the wall. I hated that more than I hated shutting my mouth.
I wouldn’t have put up with the old lady, but she was a good cook. The first time she invited me for dinner was after I went to Mickey’s for her. She said, “If you get any skinnier, you might disappear altogether.”
Mama was working an extra shift, so I went. Pretty soon, I was going there all the time. I didn’t bother telling her I learned to cook when I was a kid.
When Mama went to art school, she never cared how late we ate, if we ate the same thing every night, or if we ate at all. Her brain ignored her stomach, and so did Daddy’s, but mine didn’t.
When I complained to Daddy, he laughed and said. “That’s why we have a refrigerator and stove, skinny girl. I better teach you to cook so you don’t starve.”
I decided I ought to get more than food for the work I was doing for the old lady. So, I said, “How come you don’t pay me? Don’t you have any money?”
She gave me one of her looks. “Haven’t you heard of doing a good deed for the sake of helping another person?”
“I probably already earned my way into heaven. But it might be a long time before I get there, and I could use some cash now.”
Lena looked out the window and tried to hide her smile.
“Well then,” she grumbled, “I better put you on retainer.”
“Retainer? What’s that?”
“It means I pay you something now, and if your work is satisfactory, you get more later.”
“Forget about later. What do I get now?”
“Twenty-five bucks.”
She dug around in her purse and handed over the money. I didn’t bother telling her I’d have taken ten.
Whenever I went to her place, I’d sneak a look at that photo on the beach and try to figure out why she looked so different. She reminded me of the silverware from Daddy’s family that Mama made me polish for the holidays. Mama stored it in soft cloth bags, but the silver still turned dull and looked neglected.
That’s how the old lady looked, but nothing would make her bright and shiny again.
LENA
CAMBRIDGE RESOURCES
When I was a kid, we lived in Watertown, and Lotta practically lived at our house. We’d beg my mother to make Dom and his friends take us when they went to Cambridge, and sometimes she did. We’d hang out near Harvard Square and get a Bartley’s burger or Bailey’s ice cream while the boys cruised around looking for somebody who’d buy them a six-pack or three back then.
Nowadays, boys aren’t the only ones looking for trouble. Headstrong girls like Kalayla did whatever they pleased. I wore out my brain trying to think of something that would keep her off the streets and away from that damn Clean Duds. I was afraid some lowlife might see her there and decide she’d be easy pickings.
Classes at the library were free, but Kalayla was too old for Story Time and too young for films or book discussion groups. I made a few calls about the summer crafts and sports programs and discovered most of them had a fee. Maureen didn’t have extra money, but I’d take care of that if Kalayla were willing to do something besides guard laundry.
The day was sunny and seventy-three degrees, so I got my coffee and was at Clean Duds before 10 a.m. Kalayla was reading a book with her feet propped up as usual.
She looked up and said, “Hey Lena, were you giving your legs a rest yesterday?”
“I was minding my own business, which you’d benefit from doing. You’re turning into a couch potato with no couch. Most kids would rather play sports than lounge in a boring place like this.”
Kalayla gave me a dirty look. “Sports? You mean, like, be on a team with a bunch of jerks?”
Wouldn’t you know she ruled out team sports before I could give her my sales pitch? No matter, she wouldn’t derail my train now that I got it going.
“You could play tennis,” I said. “If you were good enough, you could play singles. Singles, as in by yourself against one other person.”
“I know what singles is! Why’d I waste my time chasing a stupid ball around? Why don’t you suggest something interesting? If you had a gun hidden in one of your white rooms, you could teach me how to shoot.”
I took a deep breath, trying to stay calm. That girl had no idea how much she sounded like one of my twins, and she picked one thing I could teach her if I had a mind to, which I sure as hell did not.
Joey loved guns, and the twins begged to see them. A week didn’t go by without Joey unlocking the footlocker, lifting out one of his precious and caressing it like a lover.
He introduced the boys to shooting the day they turned eight, the age limit for the Highland Gun Club. They started with pistols like I did. Benchrest rifles came next, and when they were strong enough, shotguns. I didn’t care for the heavier guns, so I stuck with the pistol.
Joey pushed me to compete. “You can beat the ass off any of the women, Lena. We’d be the first husband and wife champions!”
I gave in, and we won both titles four years in a row. Joey was the only one I wanted to beat, and I never did.
There was no point in wasting more time in the Clean Duds oven. Kalayla vetoed sports and I was not teaching her to shoot.
When I turned and walked toward the door, Kalaya said, “Is it too hot in here today?”
The following day, I saw her across the street talking to one of the locals, Ray Ray Bingha, who was six feet five inches tall and had two hundred and fifty pounds of muscle. His dark-brown hair was in a ponytail that trailed four inches down his back, but nobody teased him about having a girly hairdo or the two gold earrings in his left ear.
You never saw Ray Ray without Thor, his enormous bullmastiff. You didn’t need a Beware of Dog sign to warn you that Thor would rip out your throat if Ray Ray gave the signal.
Ray Ray and I were on good terms, but there was no guarantee his patience would last if Kalayla got her mouth going. I beat it across that street as fast as my legs could.
“Ray Ray!” I called as I stopped at the curb to catch my breath.
“Well, Miss Lena,” he grinned. “I haven’t seen you in quite some time. I thought you might’ve dropped dead and been buried.”
“I’m not in the habit of trolling the streets like you, Ray Ray. Don’t worry. You’ll know when I die. My son, JJ, will hire a band and invite the whole city to celebrate! I came to warn you this girl has allergic fits when she gets close to dogs. You better keep Thor away from her.”
As usual, Kalayla shifted her mouth into high gear without thinking.
“Where’d you get such a dumb idea, Lena? I love dogs!”
“Whatever,” Ray Ray said, laughing. “I just explained to this little girl that Thor isn’t interested in being her friend.”
“I’m not a little girl, and I don’t want Thor for a friend ’cause he’d probably drool all over me!”
I swear I could have slapped that girl’s face!
Contrary to what she said, Kalayla reached out to pet Thor. Ray Ray’s soft “Don’t!” froze her hand mid-air.
“The only way Thor’d find you likable would be as an appetizer for his dinner. Don’t worry, Miss Lena. he won’t bother this funny little thing. She hasn’t got enough meat on her to make it worthwhile.”
With that, Ray Ray and Thor strolled down Mass. Ave.
Kalayla put her hands on her hips and stamped her foot. “Why’d you run over here, Lena? And why’d you tell that guy I’m allergic to dogs?”
“I must have dreamed it,” I said, taking her arm like I needed something to lean on. “I want you to help sort some books in my storage bin.”
I took deep breaths all the way home. That girl had no more sense than a bug, but covering her mouth with duck tape wouldn’t help. Ray Ray likely had more than one gun tucked away, and if Kalayla ran into him again and the subject came up, teaching her to shoot might give him a laugh.
I needed to consult with Lotta, but first, I had research to do.
***
Cambridge was a good-sized city, but it was like a woman’s handbag with different compartments of different sizes. Information about Kalayla’s family was tucked in one of them, and I knew how to find it.
The members of the Ladies Knitting Club were townies who took great pride in sharing their hoard of information. Not all the members were born in Cambridge, but they grew up nearby. They knew more than a person needed to about the rivalries, tragedies, and trivia of every family in town based on a combination of facts and gossip.
The group boasted it was open to new members, which was something of a joke because you had to know somebody who knew somebody to get in. I never was a knitter and didn’t plan on becoming one, but I wasn’t worried about being welcomed. I’d drop a few snippets about the Manero-Barzetti clan, most of which would be pure fabrication.
The ability to tell good tales while keeping family secrets was a highly prized skill in my family. When we were kids, Nana and Mama taught us to play one note and make it sound like the whole orchestra.
While the ladies dug in their knitting, I circled the room and admired their fine handiwork. I eventually remarked that a girl named Kalayla and her mama had moved in across the hall from me, and the ladies fell all over themselves to tell me what they knew.
Maureen’s husband, Jamal LeeRoyce, came from an established black family in a mixed-race Cambridge neighborhood. They were community-minded Protestants, especially Jamal’s mother, Lucinda. She ran a soup kitchen for their church and occasionally took in stray kids. She was active when it came to rights for blacks. In the days of forced busing, she argued it was a lose-lose situation, and if Judge Garrity took the time to visit Roxbury and South Boston, he’d understand that.
The ladies thought the younger son, Clarence, had mental problems as a kid but was an excellent auto mechanic. The older son, Jamal, was intelligent, good in sports, and went to UMass Boston on a scholarship. He’d died while drag-racing a few years ago.
When I said Maureen’s family must have helped her when her husband died, the ladies set me straight. What they told me was close to unbelievable, and I needed time to let it sink in before I went to see Lotta.
LENA
BEST FRIENDS
Carlotta Eccli had been my best friend forever. Her approach to life was straightforward, with no gray areas, and she thought my approach was incomprehensible. Lotta pointed out that I stayed married to a vicious bastard, refused to dye my hair, and insisted on wearing black, like a corpse, in search of a coffin. To top it off, I lived in a fourth-floor walk-up apartment even though I could afford a penthouse at the Ritz.
I could count on Lotta no matter what. In addition, she was a fabulous cook, so I invited myself to dinner that night. Her house was a half-mile walk from the apartment and helped me stay in shape. Even Lotta admitted I hadn’t loaded on fat like so many of our high school classmates.
Lotta’s house was in a Cambridge neighborhood that boasted yards with trees, shrubs, and lawns. Her neighbors were not pleased when she had a five-foot-high chain-link fence installed in her backyard. “Well,” she told them, “would you prefer dogs running free and shitting all over your lawn?” That was the last she heard from them on that subject.
Lotta redecorated on the spur of the moment, but nothing had changed since my previous visit. Her kitchen was black and white, the living room and dining room pale aqua and the furniture was a Scandinavian design from Form in Teak.
We were finishing the Coq au Vin and buttery noodles when I said, “Did I tell you I went to the last meeting of the Ladies Knitting Club?”
Lotta clanked her fork on her plate. “Now, why would you do something so outrageous and act like it’s normal? You do not knit, have never knitted, and will never knit. Besides, all they do is gossip.”
“That’s why I went. I’m trying to help a fatherless child and her hard-working, widowed mother. I needed to find out a few things. What’s for dessert?”
Lotta rolled her eyes. “Mocha squares drizzled with almond sauce. What were you so hot to find out?”
“The mama told me a story that smelled like dead fish, and her daughter is wandering around Cambridge like it’s her playground. You know how dangerous that can be.”
“Mother, daughter, dead fish? Lena, please explain in plain English.”
“Fine! Maureen is the mother, and Kalayla is her daughter. They moved into the apartment across the hall from me. When I asked Maureen about her family, she changed the subject so fast that my head spun. That seemed odd, so I asked the girl about her mama’s family.
“Kalayla told me the entire family died in an explosion at a party in Brighton before she was born. I don’t remember that. Do you?”
“A story like that would have been plastered on every TV station and the front page of The Globe, The Herald, and all the rags. We couldn’t have missed it!”
“We didn’t. Maureen was lying,” I said, taking a bite of mocha square.
“That’s ridiculous! Why would she?”
“I got the whole history. Maureen’s grandmother and mother moved from Belfast, Ireland, to South Boston to be with family when the grandfather died. Maureen’s mother moved to Brighton when she got married and that’s where Maureen grew up.
“Maureen was one of four children, the family star, a straight-A student, popular and beautiful with green eyes, red hair, and a movie actress figure. She was supposed to become a nurse and marry an Irish boy named Paul O’Brien, whose father owned a law business. At least, that was her mother’s plan.”
“Ha! We all know how those plans work out. Did Maureen suck it up and go along like you did?”
I gave her a dirty look. “No, she didn’t. She fell in love with a black boy from a Protestant family and married him!”
“Oh, my God!” Lotta’s mouth dropped open. She stood up, leaned over the table, and repeated, “Oh my God!”
I had to laugh.
“Right!” I said. “Maureen’s mother disowned her and hasn’t met her granddaughter! Can you believe that?”
Lotta flopped down in her chair. Such a thing was as unimaginable to her as it was to me. She and I came from close-knit Italian-Catholic families. No matter what we did, our families would never turn away from us. Lotta was twice divorced, didn’t want children, and had casual relationships with men, but her parents stood by her. She wasn’t the critical pawn in the family’s business as I had been.
“What a vicious woman!” Lotta said. “And the rest of the family went along with her! But why in hell did Maureen lie? You know as well as I do her daughter will find out, and Maureen will have hell to pay! That woman is a loony tune. Do not open the door if she comes knocking, and do not give her or her daughter another thought!”
I took a sip of coffee and set my cup down carefully. “Funny that you would say that. You never once turned your back on an abused or abandoned animal, even when it caused you a boatload of problems.”
Lotta drove her parents crazy, bringing stray or hurt animals home. She now owned the most respected and best-run animal shelter in Cambridge and the surrounding towns.
Lotta sighed. “It is not the same. Animals can’t help themselves. People can. You’ve got a burr in your side over this, and nothing I say will change your mind. How do you plan to help?”
“Maureen works at Eddie’s. When one of his regular girls quit, I asked him to put her on the days and give her a raise so she wouldn’t have to take cleaning jobs. Kalayla is a disaster waiting to happen, and I have no idea what to do.”
We cleared the table and loaded the dishwasher. Finally, Lotta said, “I’ll make fresh coffee. Tell me what you tried that didn’t work.”
Relief flooded me. “Kalayla refuses to play sports and has no interest in art or any crafts. She hangs out at Clean Duds or roams around alone.”
“That’s good, not good at all.”
While Lotta continued puttering, I settled into a living room chair. Lotta always thought about every possibility before she did anything. In the late 1940s, girls didn’t leave their marriage via a back door, but Lotta did. When she caved into family pressure and married, she convinced her boyfriend they should have a civil ceremony at Watertown City Hall. She knew the Catholic Church didn’t recognize marriages performed by a Justice of the Peace.
Her parents were furious and insisted that she and Stan have a proper wedding, but Lotta was already maneuvering out that back door. Stan’s idea of a good time was slapping her around, and she wasn’t about to put up with that. Her younger brother, Mattwo, had a heavyweight influence in her family, and Lotta went to him for help. He convinced Stan that an annulment would be his best option.
Two years later, Lotta married Jeff Procopio in a civil ceremony. In less than a month, she decided Jeff’s romantic gifts and sappy notes were an irritation rather than a blessing. Mattwo again came to her rescue, and Jeff departed. No one in Lotta’s family mentioned marriage to her again.
I heard the soft hum of the dishwasher. Lotta handed me a coffee mug, flopped on the sofa, and curled her legs under her.
“Maybe we’ll get lucky and find out the girl has as much sense as a cat or a dog,” she said.
I laughed, “So, what do you think?”
Lotta stared at me for a full minute before saying, “You won’t like the idea, but I think Matty’s Way is worth a try. Going there worked for your twins; no sane person would have said they were easy to control.”
I came close to spilling my coffee. What was I thinking? Of course, Lotta would suggest Matty’s Way.
Lotta’s father started Matty’s Way as a dojo for judo and karate in the 1920s. When he retired, Lotta’s brother, Mattwo, took over and added aerobic and strength training classes. His son, Lotta’s nephew, Rico, was next in line to run the gym.

ESSENTIAL INFORMATION FOR THE READER
Before I wrote Kalayla, I thought writers who said their characters talked to them were exaggerating, hallucinating, or fibbing. I found out they weren’t when it happened to me. Having the characters in my head was aggravating and exhausting. I needed a break, and although I knew I hadn’t resolved all the characters’ issues, I felt as if I’d done my best. I assumed that ending and publishing the book would be acceptable.
I was wrong. I didn’t understand that I had entered into a covenant with the characters. I didn’t realize they would feel abandoned and betrayed because I hadn’t finished telling their stories. I didn’t expect their response to be insistent and demanding.
The fact of the matter was I loved the characters, related to their struggles, and hadn’t meant to disappoint them. So, I recommitted, fully aware that they preferred late-night conversations, and sleepless nights would follow. I listened attentively and researched topics of concern to them. Outspoken characters continued to speak their minds, and to my delight, previously voiceless characters revealed their complicated and tangled backgrounds. 
I concluded I couldn’t simply write a sequel to Kalayla. I had to rewrite the story and incorporate what I learned, which I did in Kalayla Unraveling Tangles. The book was a fascinating and joyous collaboration that showcases the complexity of the characters’ lives. I thank my family and friends, who encouraged me to persevere, and I am grateful the characters are satisfied and comfortingly silent.
Exploring the dynamics in Kalayla’s extended family encouraged me to think about my life’s tangles and pose a question for myself and the readers. How do we unravel our tangles with kindness and help ourselves and others find a constructive way forward?

UNRAVELING TANGLES
KALAYLA’S GREAT GRANDPARENTS
PRELUDE
BELFAST, IRELAND, 1960
The girl tucked her chair against the right side of the bed, her ear almost touching the lips of her father’s disfigured face. His voice was hoarse, barely audible, each word a painful effort, “I’m done,” Colin Doyle said, gasping for breath.
His daughter, Colleen, knew he would say more if he could. She waited, as she’d been waiting for six endless days.
Colleen had been afraid long before the lads carried her broken father home. Time and time again, she heard her mother, Mary Margaret, warn him to be cautious and to watch his words. Colleen had experience skirting Belfast’s danger, and she knew her mother was right. They lived among enemies whose smiling faces could turn to snarls with the slightest provocation. Despite her mother’s pleas, the daredevil side of Colin refused to reign in its cockiness.
Colin was a magician with machines, crooning to them softly, fixing any broken or improperly balanced. He believed his talent protected him. The Protestant bosses at the linen factory called Colin the devil Taig—as if his ability had its source in hell. Worse than that, Colin and Mary Margaret were Catholics in a sea of Protestant workers, any one of whom might repeat Colin’s arrogant taunts to the B Specials, the part-time constable police force in Northern Ireland.
Everyone knew Colin Doyle was on the list of suspected IRA members. He was a burly-brash man who danced on the narrowest of ledges as if he considered a Catholic taunting the B Specials a schoolyard game.
“No worries,” he’d tell Mary Margaret, pulling her close. “They’ll not be so foolish as to come after me.”
But one night six days ago, they saw the chance and did. Colin had gone with the neighborhood lads to the Horse Trough Pub, but when the others left, Colin waved them off. He’d won a few pence arm wrestling and would stay on to see if his luck would hold.
In the wee hours, Mary Margaret sent word that her husband hadn’t come home. The lads went searching and brought what was left of Colin back to her and Colleen. “IRA scum” was smeared in the blood on her husband’s chest, his mangled body a showpiece of brutality.
Mary Margaret knew what she had to do. Colleen would be ten soon, the age when children went to work in the linen factory. Mary Margaret’s childless sister and husband lived in South Boston in the United States, and they offered Mary Margaret and Colleen a place to live. Mary Margaret had no other choice. She couldn’t pay the rent, and it would be too dangerous for any friend or relative to take them in. They would stay in Belfast until after Colin had a proper Catholic burial.
Mary Margaret stowed her grief in her apron pocket and went to the linen factory every day from six a.m. to nine p.m. as Colin would expect her to.
While her mother worked, Colleen sat alone beside the body that had been her father. She knew he would expect her to be brave, but every sound was terrifying. When they found out Colin wasn’t dead, would they come to finish their work and they kill her, too? Or would they use her as their whore the way the neighborhood girls said they did if they caught you alone?
Later, when Colleen took her da bread and milk for his noontime meal, he took a ragged breath and said, “No food, no water. Our secret.”
Colleen closed her eyes and dug her nails into her clenched fists. She understood it had to be their secret. Her mother would never allow Colin to starve himself. She’d say it was a mortal sin, and the timing and manner of his death was God’s choice, not his.
Her da would scoff at that idea. Although Colin went with Mary Margaret and Colleen to mass every Sunday and on Holy Days of Obligation, he mocked church teachings with the same regularity. He told his daughter that sins were nothing more than a deck of cards in a game of make-believe. Colleen listened wide-eyed, trusting the handsome man who carried her on his shoulders, taught her to sing, spun bedtime stories of goblins, fairies, and dragons, and knew everything.
The battered body beside her bore no resemblance to that Da, but Colleen heard the echo of his tenor’s lilt in the ragged voice, and that was enough for her. She could do what he wanted. After all, she was nine years old, the miracle child, the one of five who lived. Three sisters died before she was born, and one brother after. Mum said the factory’s damp, foul air and ever-present coughing sickness made her womb unhealthy. Colleen had been strong enough to survive, and she was strong enough to set her father free to sing again.
SOUTH BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS/SOUTHIE
Colleen hated Southie more than she hated Belfast. The landscape in Belfast had been familiar, the tension as commonplace as the insults hurled by Catholic and Protestant kids across divided streets. The girl’s fear was monotonous and ever-present.
The landscape in Southie was unknown, a deafening source of terror. Noise from planes, trains, sirens, horns, and trolleys mingled with shouting adults and crying children. Teenage gangs wandered without defined boundaries. Music blared from their transistor radios and competed with record players from the Project’s open windows. Any step might trigger an invisible booby trap. The girl’s fear was intense and ever-present.
Her aunt’s and her uncle’s flat was in a Catholic enclave in the Old Dominion Housing projects, three-story brick buildings near a traffic circle and park. Neighborhood kids invited Colleen to go adventuring, but what if they were like her da, whose willingness to take risks had gotten him killed? When they grew tired of her excuses and stopped asking, she didn’t care. Colleen stayed observant, alert, and close to home.
Colleen’s mother wasn’t willing to settle for life in a housing project. Her sister was satisfied to be a part-time seamstress and pleased that her husband had a steady job as a postal worker. She didn’t have a daughter to spur her to a better life.
If Colin had listened to Mary Margaret, they would have moved to Cork or Dublin before Colleen turned three. But he didn’t, and she was left to deal with the consequences of his myopic vision. She’d had her fill of factory work and knew she could sell her domestic skills.
City Point was less than a two-mile walk from the Old Dominion projects but light years away in gentility and prosperity, with mansion-like houses beacons beckoning to a better life. With a subtle hint of arrogance, Mary Margaret spun a tale about her previous employment to the mistress of the grandest house, who hired her on the spot. The mistress could casually brag that she’d hired a household staff manager recently employed by the royal family to maintain their Belfast residence.
Mary Margaret told Colleen that night, “I’ll learn all I can about gentry life. God helped us get this far, Colleen. The rest is up to us.”
Colleen didn’t brag or preen in front of the other girls in the ensuing years. She made the honor roll but didn’t brown-nose the teachers. She helped classmates who struggled with math or English. Colleen’s aunt and uncle became surrogate parents. Her aunt enjoyed sewing school clothes for her, and when Colleen was old enough to attend Catholic mixers in Boston, her aunt added flattering tucks, ruffles, and ribbons. Colleen’s uncle was a quiet, unassuming man.
Colleen realized she couldn’t marry anyone mercurial like her da, whose firecracker mouth got him murdered. She needed a steady, solid man to raise a family without fear.
She was nearly eighteen when she met Kevin O’Rourke, an auto mechanic saving to buy a garage or two if things went as he planned. Kevin was down-to-earth and safe. He wanted three or four children and a home to welcome them and their friends. Colleen could build a life with him, and he wouldn’t shatter it.
SUMMER 1999
LENA MANERO BARZETTI
THAT GIRL
I’m not one of those old biddies who minds other people’s business instead of her own. But, there are some people it is impossible to ignore, and that girl, Kalayla, was one of them.
The first time I saw Kalayla was mid-June last year. I was walking back from Mickey’s Market on one of those perfect sunny days that made you believe you could live happily ever after. The National Scoop headline, “Princess Diana’s Death Revealed as Hoax,” made the same promise.
Kalayla was ahead of me, half swaggering, half strutting in a way so familiar I thought I must know her. I ruminated on it until I realized my twins walked like that when they were showing off, which was pretty much from the minute they got up until they went to bed.
How often had I seen those two boys swagger, strut, or taunt each other? Mikie would dare Jimmy, “Bet it takes you more than 20 seconds to shimmy up that streetlight.” Jimmy would dare Mikie, “Bet you can’t get five bucks panhandling between here and home.” Off they’d go, running, laughing, shoving and punching.
The blast from a horn jolted me out of daydreaming, or I’d have bumped right into Kalayla. She was staring into Hanson’s Book Store window, and her saucer-sized green eyes briefly glanced my way.
I pegged Kalayla as a Cambridge street kid scraping her way from one meal to the next, an old hand at trash picking and layering up with everything she found. That day, she wore three layers on top with a mishmash of colors and designs; a rope held up the baggy capri-length pants that would have been shorts on someone taller. A beat-up blue-and-red baseball cap with the brim turned backward squashed down her kinky orange-brown curls. She was an inch or two shorter than my five feet two inches, and I couldn’t tell how old she was. Most teenage girls wanted to show off their bodies, but Kalayla didn’t.
After that, I saw Kalayla everywhere I went. She was always by herself, and I wondered why. The only way my four boys were alone was if they were going to or coming from someplace where other kids were hanging out. Even my boy Mark, who was always getting in fights, had plenty of friends. If I were that girl’s mama, the fact she was alone so much would have worried me.
***
About two weeks later, I was walking back from buying milk and eggs at Mickey’s Market when I saw Kalayla talking to Maureen, the red-headed woman who waited tables at Eddie’s Eatery. Eddie’s was across from my apartment building, and sometimes I stopped by to chat. Maureen was friendly and cheerful but didn’t blab personal stuff like some folks. Eddie told me she was a widow with a daughter.
I watched Maureen kiss her on the forehead and go into Eddie’s. The girl had the same huge green eyes and delicate features Maureen did. Maureen’s skin was ivory, and the girl’s was light chocolate, but she had to be her daughter. She crossed the street and went into my apartment building. I hurried to see where she was going, but she had disappeared when I arrived.
I didn’t just live in the building. I owned it and the building where Eddie’s was located. They were the first properties Joey and I bought after we married, and our families solidified their business partnership by forming Manzetti Properties. Joey didn’t turn out to be much of a husband, but his family knew all the angles when it came to rehab and construction, and my family was skillful and shrewd at buying and marketing real estate.
My job was to locate vacant buildings or properties the owner was interested in offloading quickly. I kept my eye out for local contractors. It was good public relations to involve them in small tear-downs or rehabs and leave the big jobs to Joey’s crews. My office was at our corporate headquarters, and I still worked one or two days a week.
My brother Dominic was a financial wizard who’d been pretending to train his son and daughter to take over for him for the last three years. When I asked Dom if he knew anything about the girl and her mother, he laughed and said, “Have you been walking around with your eyes closed, Lena? Those two moved in across the hall from you.”
Well, I never! When they moved in, I must have been volunteering at Helping Hands Shelter for Women, having supper at Dom’s, or out with my best friend, Carlotta. That girl didn’t come across as if she wanted to keep a low profile, but Voles hunkered down underground would have gotten my attention faster than those two.
A few days later, I saw Kalayla on our landing, staring out the window like a lost soul, and it wrenched my heart. I’d looked out the window many times and wished I’d see Jimmy or Mikie strutting down the street. But no amount of wishing could bring them back from the dead. And no amount of wishing changed the fact that the girl reminded me of them. When we finally did speak, it was no surprise the first thing out of her mouth was a smart-assed comment, like my twins would have made.
When my boys were growing up, Lotta repeatedly told me to wash the twins’ mouths with soap. She never raised kids, or she would have known you can’t stick a bar of soap into a child’s mouth, no matter how tempted you might be.
KALAYLA LEEROYCE
THE OLD LADY
That crabby old lady would swear I never paid attention to a word she said, but she’d be wrong. Her name was Lena Barzetti, and I called her crabby ’cause that’s what she was ninety-five percent of the time. She was seventy-two years old, and boy, did she look it. I was exploring the new neighborhood that summer and got to know her.
It didn’t get dark until late, so I could be out without flipping Mama out. Our building was on a corner with a light, about halfway between Harvard Square and Arlington. Massachusetts Avenue had sidewalks. I could walk on one side of the street until I got bored, then cross the street and walk back on the other.
I liked meeting people who were walking their dogs. Pets weren’t allowed in our building. I told Mama it’d be easy to sneak in a dog or cat, but she lectured me about not doing anything to get us kicked out of the apartment—as if I would!
Second Time Clothes, White’s Fruits and Vegetables, and Mickey’s Market were within a few blocks. You could get your nails or toes done at Tammy’s Tips or your hair straightened at Creative Clips. Magneson’s Flower Shop owners were friendly, but my favorite place was Clean Duds Laundromat.
Regulars there knew better than to go on an errand while their laundry was in the washer or dryer. I earned an easy buck sitting with my feet propped up on the windowsill and reading a book like I owned the place. I kept an eye out for anybody with an empty basket or bag who acted like they were lost while they checked the place out. I’d give them a big smile and say, “You need help?” That cleared out the shifty types pretty fast.
***
One day, when I was standing on the landing between the third and fourth floors of the apartment building, staring out the window and planning my afternoon, I heard slow footsteps coming up the stairs. That was when I met old lady Lena.
The weird thing was she only wore black. Her dress, socks, and shoes were all black like she worked at a funeral home, and that was her uniform. She was dragging a couple of duffle bags. If she collapsed, I’d be stuck dialing 911.
She stopped when she got to the landing, and I saw that the bags were full of black clothes. She must’ve come from Clean Duds. She had to be dumber than dumb to live on the fourth floor of a building with no elevator. Besides, anybody smart would’ve taken small loads instead of everything they owned.
If I felt like starting a conversation—which I didn’t—I might’ve pointed that out.
The old lady said, “Little girl, if you don’t have anything to do, I can give you some work.”
Dumber than dumb, like I thought, right?
“If it looks to you like I’m hanging out here waiting for a job, you need glasses. And I’m not a little girl. I’m twelve years old.”
She stared at me long and hard. “Well, maybe you want to be an architect, and you’re staring at those buildings to get ideas. Good view from up here.”
I gotta say that was worth a laugh. “Nah,” I said, “I’m just planning my day.”
“Then how about helping me carry this laundry?”
“My mama told me not to talk to strangers or carry laundry for them. A good-looking girl like me has to be real careful.”
She stared longer and harder this time. Anybody could see I wouldn’t be crowned queen of the apartment building, even competing against people like her. Maybe her eyesight was lousy.
“Well,” she said, “I’m interested in your muscles, not your looks or mouth. I’ll give you a Coke for pay.”
“I don’t like Coke. I’ll take a root beer.”
“All kids like Coke, and I don’t have root beer. I have lemons, water, and sugar to make lemonade. I can throw in a few cookies. Will that satisfy you?”
“What kind of cookies?”
She rolled her eyes like she couldn’t believe I’d ask that, but I wasn’t lugging laundry for plain old sugar cookies.
“Peanut butter—fresh made.”
“Fine!” I said, heaving one bag over each shoulder.
Her apartment was the same as ours, but it was almost empty. Every wall was white, and there was nothing, not one thing, on them. The window shades and the rug in front of the sofa were white. The couch and chair were white. Everybody knew you’d have to wash or clean all that white every other day. Nobody but a rich person could afford that, and she sure didn’t look rich.
She said, “Don’t stand there gawking. Put the laundry bags in the closet in the spare room.”
That’d be my bedroom at home, but I couldn’t tell what it was for her. The walls, window shades, and rug in the middle of the room were all white. A small wooden table and a straight-back chair were near the window. Maybe she lived someplace else and came here ’cause she liked Clean Duds. I dumped the bags on the floor in the closet but felt like I’d messed things up.
She was in the kitchen mixing the lemonade, and I decided I better find out how crazy she was before I had any. So, I said, “Do you live in a monastery and just keep this place to store stuff?”
She gave me a big-time stare and said, “That smart mouth must get you in trouble at school. What would you know about a monastery?”
“I read a book that said the walls are white, and they give you a chair, a bed, an extra robe, a pair of shoes, and a box to store them.”
“Is that a fact? So, you read books?”
“Yeah. What of it? You never met a kid who reads books?” Why wasn’t she asking me the usual stupid adult questions like how I was doing in school and how many brothers and sisters I had?
“That would be an example of the mouth I was talking about. I’ve got a lot of books you could look at if you wanted to.”
Why’d she think I’d want to read her crummy old books? I thought about leaving until she brought out the peanut butter cookies. I tasted one and decided to stay long enough to eat a few.
“You can call me Lena,” she said. “And I suppose you have a name.”
Did she think my parents named me Girl like some jerks named their dog Dog?
“Sure, I got a name. It’s Kalayla.”
“Ka lay la,” she repeated slowly. “That’s unusual and pretty. Is it a family name?”
“Nah. My mama thought it up. She’s smart about some things.”
I drank a lot of lemonade that summer ’cause the old lady asked me for help every five minutes. Sometimes, she annoyed me so much I wanted to spit, but I wasn’t giving up free lemonade and cookies.
I didn’t mind ’cause Mama wasn’t home much. We got a car last year, and she cleaned houses before her four-nine shift at Eddie’s. Standing on the landing, I could watch her serving customers or clearing tables. Sometimes, I’d go over to hang out and have a snack.
Mama attended classes or did art projects when Daddy was alive instead of working. She didn’t have a studio now. Even if we had room for one, she was too busy working.
***
When summer came, Mama decided we should spend more time together and have Sunday morning talks. We’d sit at the kitchen table while she drank coffee, and I’d fix whatever I felt like eating. Mostly, Mama asked me questions, and I tried not to lie too much. Sometimes, I had to ’cause she was hyper-nervous about what I was doing and where I was going.
This morning, she said, “Are you going to the library today?”
I never told her the library was closed on Sundays during the summer, so I said, “Haven’t made plans yet, Mama. Is there something you want me to do?”
“Well, no, but if you’re going out, you might want to change your clothes.”
Cow turds! Even the old lady didn’t bug me about how I dressed, and she bugged me about plenty of stuff. Someday, I might try going naked to see if Mama liked that better!
Sometimes, Mama got going on how important family was, which was weird ’cause her family died in a gas explosion, so I never met them. Mama seemed nervous when we visited Daddy’s family, so I decided she liked talking about family more than being with it.
After Daddy died, his brother, Clarence, thought he’d do us a big favor and drop by to see us. He bragged about how good he was at getting good car deals and offered to find one for us. Clarence always made her nervous, so when she asked me what I thought, I said, “He’ll get us a car when he gets a real job.”
“Layla, I wish you wouldn’t say things like that about Clarence.”
“It’s the truth, so why shouldn’t I say it?”
“He’s your uncle, and you should be respectful.”
“I am respectful. I never called him a butthole to his face, did I?”
Mama sighed like she wished I’d shut my mouth, but she knew I wouldn’t.
For once, Clarence did what he said. He found a blue Ford with eighty thousand miles and not too many scrapes and dents. He kept bragging about how it had a fine American engine, and he had detailed it himself. I got sick of hearing that, so I said, “Wow! You mean you did something besides sit on your butt?” I took off before he could slap me. Mama started cleaning houses after we got the car.
***
My grandparents lived near Inman Square in Cambridge. After Daddy died, Grandma told everyone that Mama was exhausted and needed to rest, so we stayed with them. That was a bunch of bull. Mama wasn’t exhausted. She had a nervous breakdown. Grandma knew it; I knew it, and so did everybody else.
Staying with them would’ve been okay, except they dragged me to church. I wanted to tell Grandma they should take Clarence instead of me, but she would’ve said I was rude.
When Mama finally got back to normal, she got a job at Eddie’s, and we moved to a smaller apartment. Mama said decorating the apartment would be her art project, but everybody knew fixing up an apartment wasn’t the same as having a studio.
It was kind of funny, but once we moved to the new apartment, the person I saw the most was the old lady. She liked Clean Duds and dropped by every day with her iced coffee. I decided her life had to be pretty boring if all she had to do was take up my valuable time.
She’d pull up a chair and say something like, “Too hot to be out,” when it was just as hot inside as it was out. Clean Duds had a couple of standing fans chained to the wall, but all they did was blow around hot air and make a lot of noise.
Mama told me that black absorbs the most heat of any color. So, on one of those broiling days, I said, “If you’re so hot, why are you wearing black?”
She gave me the icy stare routine. “What color I wear and why I wear it is no business of yours!”
Fine! It would serve her right if she fried!
When the old lady wanted me to do stuff, she’d ask if I wanted to earn a Coke. That turned into a joke, and I’d say, “I’ll have a vanilla Coke float with chocolate ice cream, thanks.”
I got used to the whiteness in her apartment, and in a way, I kind of liked it. It was like a blank page, and you could decorate it any way you wanted. A small bookcase in the corner of the living room had photos of some boys. Mama had pictures of her, me, and Daddy everywhere, but Lena’s place wasn’t normal like ours.
One of the photos was of a beautiful woman standing in water a little above her ankles at the ocean. Her dark-brown hair was blowing around her shoulders, and the wind whipped her dress so you could see her legs. Two little boys were building a sand fort on the shore.
I pointed at the photo and said, “Is that a friend of yours?”
“A friend? That’s me you’re looking at, Kalayla, in my younger days.”
I covered my mouth to keep from snorting. I almost said, “Yeah, a couple hundred years ago,” but I already had her lecture on being polite memorized.
In another photo, the same woman held the two little boys to keep them from squirming away. Two older boys stood straight as statues beside them.
“Are those your kids? How come I never see them here?”
The old lady didn’t say anything for so long that I thought she might’ve gone deaf. Finally, she said, “I had four sons, and those photos were taken when they were little. You better go home, Kalayla. Your mama’s likely waiting.”
LENA
THE MAMA
That girl was sticking her nose into places she shouldn’t, like asking me about my boys. What good would come of me telling her two of them were dead, that I didn’t know if the third was living, and the fourth was a big-shot businessman who thought I was as desirable a mother as a field of poison ivy.
I decided I better get to know Kalayla’s mother. The fact I’d done a lousy job raising my boys meant I could give her plenty of good advice on what not to do.
I bagged a batch of Lotta’s cookies the following Sunday afternoon and went to Maureen’s. When she answered my knock, her smile was genuine, “Lena! I’m so glad it’s you! Please come in. Kalayla’s at the library; she’ll be sorry she missed you. I hope you’ll like what I’ve done to the apartment. I’m an artist, well, not a real artist. I mean, I’ve never earned any money with my art. Oh, do come in!” Maureen asked Dom if she could choose wall colors and do the painting herself. Of course, he said yes because he wouldn’t need to pay our painting crew. Dom’s knee-jerk reaction was to pinch every penny, nickel, dime, and quarter any way he could. The joke was that he didn’t know how much Maureen loved color! The entire apartment would have to be repainted when she moved out, and Dom would be on his high horse about that!
The wall colors reminded me of tropical fish with their brilliant colors. Two of the kitchen walls were yellow, and two were orange. The cushions, curtains, and wall decorations were a mixture of stripes, polka dots, and geometric shapes in yellow, orange, green, and white.
“Maureen, I don’t know what to say except what you’ve done is just plain wonderful!”
“Oh! I’m so relieved you like it. When Layla told me your apartment was all white, I was afraid you might ask us to repaint every room.”
“The house I lived in before I moved here was full of color. You should consider being a home decorator instead of waiting on tables and cleaning houses.”
“Oh, I’d love that, but I don’t have any formal training or experience, and I don’t have a college degree. I started on one, but—.”
If Maureen had gone on instead of stopping abruptly, I might have found out more, but instead, she gave me a tour of the apartment. Every room was unique, and her creativity was unmistakable.
When Maureen told me Kalayla was at the library on a Sunday afternoon in July, I knew I’d come just in time. I decided to get to know her before pointing out that her daughter was prone to altering the truth when it suited her.
After we settled in the living room with coffee and Lotta’s cookies, Maureen started talking again.
“I’m so glad you came, Lena. I can’t chat when I’m working. I wouldn’t want Eddie to think I was wasting time.”
“Don’t you worry about Eddie. He’d cut you some slack. Is this your first job?”
“Oh dear, is it that obvious? I didn’t work when Jamal was alive. I enrolled at Rhode Island School of Design as a part-time student, and took one or two classes each semester. It was taking forever, but I loved it. Our apartment was big enough that I had a studio, and after I had Kalayla, I put her crib there and later her pack ’n-play.
“When she started crawling, she was so quiet that I’d lose track of her. One day, I found her in the kitchen with everything from the bottom cupboards strewn on the floor. Jamal put on baby-proof cupboard locks and gates across the doorways. That worked until she figured out how to climb over them.
“When Jamal died, my life changed completely.”
I took a sip of coffee and waited for Maureen to go on, but she’d run out of steam. She fiddled with the handle of her mug until I said, “Your family must have been a big help when your husband died.”
Stricken was the only way to describe Maureen’s expression, and I knew I’d stumbled onto a right big sore spot.
“My family? No, they didn’t help, but my in-laws were good to us. Lucina and Harmon would have helped us move, and Jamal’s brother, Clarence, would have, too, but I wasn’t sure if that would cause problems.”
I didn’t bother asking why Maureen thought having Jamal’s family move them in might be a problem. It was 1999, but the idea of whites and blacks getting together still rubbed some folks the wrong way. It wouldn’t have bothered me, but Maureen might’ve found out the hard way that not everybody felt like I did. You could never tell when bigotry would come around the corner and hit you in the face.
Uncle Clarence must be the black guy I’d seen who stopped in and left about ten minutes later. When it came to helping, you’d think an uncle would do more than a drive-by on the way to somewhere else.
Before I could say anything, Maureen said, “Kalayla told me she sees you at Clean Duds. I’m glad I have the chance to ask you. She’s not getting into any trouble, is she? I mean, like hanging out with the wrong kids?”
Huh! I wished Kalayla had friends, and her mama was afraid she’d find the wrong ones!
“As far as I can tell, she doesn’t hang out with anyone.”
“That’s a relief. Kalayla told me you have four boys. I bet they were a handful! I’m having a hard time with one girl. You must be so glad they’re all grown. How are they doing?”
I admit that stopped me. Everybody knew about my family, and I never had to explain why, when, or how things happened to my boys or my husband.
I could have told Maureen my twins joined the Marines during the anti-war protests. I could have told her my second son, Mark, had disappeared from the face of the earth about fifteen years ago, and I didn’t know if he was alive. I could have told her I worried that my oldest boy, JJ, had become a clone of his dad, which was the worst thing he could have done.
Eventually, I said, “My oldest, JJ, runs the construction side of our family business. My second boy, Mark, moved out West. I’m not sure where he is or what he’s doing. The twins, Jimmy and Mikie, were the youngest. They were killed in Vietnam less than a year after their dad died.”
The color drained from Maureen’s face.
“How awful!” she said. “Now I understand why you wear black. Oh dear, that didn’t come out right. I just meant I’m so sorry.”
Yeah, everybody was sorry, especially me.
LATER IN THE DAY
Talking to Maureen made me think about Joey, how he loved high living and being the top man, how he bragged that his boys were like him, and I hoped they weren’t.
Joey said acting out was healthy for boys because they needed to prove themselves. He said the trouble they got into was good, harmless fun. I believed him until I realized not all the fun was harmless.
I was sure Mark was doing fine in school until I got calls saying he wasn’t.
“Mrs. Barzetti? This is John DiSilva, the principal at Mark’s school. I’m calling about an incident at lunch today. Mark smashed another kid’s piece of pie in his face.”
I knew Mark had a temper, but I’d never seen it get out of hand. Joey told me all boys fight with their brothers and that I should ignore it. So I did, but picking a fight outside the family was different.
“My Mark?” I said. “That doesn’t make sense. You must have him mixed up with some other boy.”
“I don’t think so, Mrs. Barzetti. He’s sitting right here in my office. You can ask him yourself.”
There was no doubt it was Mark’s voice saying: “Yeah, Ma, I ate the lunch you made me. I wasn’t going to eat his pie. But the kid is an asshole and does stuff that aggravates me, like giving me looks. Today, he bragged that he had a steak sandwich and cherry pie. I got sick of it. You should have seen him with cherries dripping down his face. I hope he gets a beating for ruining his shirt.”
“Mark! Shame on you! That’s not …”
“Ma, listen, okay? Dad wouldn’t put up with that, so why should I?”
“Don’t tell me what your dad would do! We’re talking about what you did!”
“Ma, I know. I promise I won’t do it again. Mr. D. wants to talk to you.”
Mark said he wouldn’t do it again, but he made a lot of promises he never kept. Nothing was ever his fault, and fighting over aggravations became the story of his life.
“I’m trying, Ma,” he’d tell me, and maybe he did.
Mark never had anybody watching his back like the twins did for each other. When JJ was four, and Mark was three, Joey told JJ to toughen up his younger brother. JJ used Mark as a punching bag. At first, Mark came to me for protection, but Joey called him a mama’s boy. That was far worse than anything JJ did to him.
JJ and his father were over six feet, and the twins were six feet by the time they turned fourteen. Joey rubbed it in by nicknaming Mark “Shrimp.”
I never got calls about the twins getting into fights, but they found other ways of getting into trouble. On their first day in kindergarten, the principal suspended them from the school bus for three days for teaching the other boys to play poker, which the school considered gambling.
I told Joey we should make them walk to school as a punishment. He laughed, “Why should they walk? They’re chips off the old block. Don’t worry, Lena. I’ll talk to them. The next time, they’ll be smart enough to hide the damn cards and not to admit anything. If you want to keep that fancy car I gave you, you’ll drive them to school until they can ride the bus.”
So I did.
They were eight when I grounded Jimmy for forgetting a chore, and they informed me they now had a punishment sharing agreement. When I told them I’d never heard of such a thing, Mikie said, “Yeah, Ma, that’s because we just invented it.”
“Your turn,” Jimmy would say, and Mikie would take the punishment for something his brother had done. It nearly drove me crazy.
When I tried punishing both for something one of them had done, they cocked their heads, gave me their lopsided grins, and said together, “Ahh, Ma, that’s not fair!” They were constantly whispering, planning, and getting smarter.
The day Mikie brought a brand-new backpack home, I said, “Where’d you get that? You didn’t steal it, did you?”
They laughed hysterically, and Mikie said, “Ma, we’d be lousy thieves, but we’re the best at working angles. Look at all the cool pockets. This one is much better than my old one.”
The twins hid behind a flow of fast talk and excuses, Joey style. Of course, their father backed them up. “If they’re smart enough to get it, they can keep it. Learning to skate on thin ice without falling in is good for them.”
When they reached 7th grade, I stopped telling them to return things like a leather jacket, a signed baseball, or a camera.
Even Joey couldn’t drive a wedge between them. When Mikie wrecked his bike, they made do with one, taking turns riding on the handlebars and giving me heartburn. Joey would have bought Mikie any bike he wanted, but they were happy sharing.
When the twins turned sixteen, Joey said he’d buy each of them a car. Mikie and Jimmy huddled, discussing his offer, and told Joey one car would be enough. They went to every car showroom within biking distance, spent hours studying brochures, and debated the pros and cons of every model.
When Joey offered them his advice, they said, “We got it covered, Dad, thanks anyway.”
They agreed on a Shelby Mustang GT 500, and naturally, Joey got a good deal with extras thrown in. Mikie won the buck up over color, choosing dark moss green, and Jimmy picked the black leather upholstery.
They named the car Miss Clementine, and one or both were always polishing her. When Joey said Clementine was a ridiculous name for a car, they walked out the door and called, “Hey Ma, we’re taking sweet Miss Clementine for a ride.”
They were smart enough never to push Joey too far, and they got around me with smiles, sweet talk, and what I believed were good intentions. They explained their behavior with the most favorable interpretation, and all I could do was hope they were telling the truth.
When they gave me a dozen roses for my birthday, a purple silk scarf for Christmas, or a three-pound box of candy for Mother’s Day, I asked where they got the money.
“We run errands, rake leaves, and shovel snow to help people out, Ma. You ought to be proud of how helpful we are!”
We named our firstborn Joseph John Barzetti, Jr. after Joey. Everybody called him JJ. He worshipped his dad, followed Joey around, and listened to everything his father told him. I never got calls about his behavior.
I was certain Kalayla’s mama did not intend for her to run. I was never a young widow working two jobs and trying to keep track of a twelve-year-old daughter, but I knew that keeping track of kids was like chasing marbles going downhill. They kept on rolling, and you kept on running.
Somebody had to help Maureen. I didn’t see anybody volunteering, which left it up to me.
KALAYLA
HELPING THE OLD LADY
Old lady Lena was always sticking her nose in my business. That made me mad ’cause it reminded me how that jerk, Clarence, tried to butt into my life when Mama and I stayed with Grandma and Grandpa after Daddy died.
It took Grandma about fifteen seconds to enroll me in a school near them. On my second day, I was standing in the hall near my classroom when a fat-assed girl bumped into me.
“Hey, new kid,” she said. “I heard your grandma told you to pass for black so you could get into a fancy private school next year. Right?”
I could’ve slammed my fist into her fat face, but I didn’t. I could’ve asked her if she ate cow turds for breakfast, but I didn’t. The bell rang, and I ducked into class without saying anything. I knew better than to make trouble at school, and I was used to comments from butthole kids.
When Uncle Clarence asked me how I liked the school, I made the mistake of telling him what the kid said.
He cracked up laughing. “If you ever decide to pass, Kalayla, pass for white. You’ll be a beauty like your mama. A passel of dudes would pay plenty to get their hands on her creamy white skin. Your skin isn’t white, but it sure is a sweet chocolate!” He was still laughing when he went out the front door.
Clarence’s mouth was worse than mine, but if I told Mama that, she would’ve said, “Clarence is your only uncle. You should treat him with respect.”
I’d rather have no uncle than a turd like him, but if I said that, Mama would make me sit in the corner facing the wall. I hated that more than I hated shutting my mouth.
I wouldn’t have put up with the old lady, but she was a good cook. The first time she invited me for dinner was after I went to Mickey’s for her. She said, “If you get any skinnier, you might disappear altogether.”
Mama was working an extra shift, so I went. Pretty soon, I was going there all the time. I didn’t bother telling her I learned to cook when I was a kid.
When Mama went to art school, she never cared how late we ate, if we ate the same thing every night, or if we ate at all. Her brain ignored her stomach, and so did Daddy’s, but mine didn’t.
When I complained to Daddy, he laughed and said. “That’s why we have a refrigerator and stove, skinny girl. I better teach you to cook so you don’t starve.”
I decided I ought to get more than food for the work I was doing for the old lady. So, I said, “How come you don’t pay me? Don’t you have any money?”
She gave me one of her looks. “Haven’t you heard of doing a good deed for the sake of helping another person?”
“I probably already earned my way into heaven. But it might be a long time before I get there, and I could use some cash now.”
Lena looked out the window and tried to hide her smile.
“Well then,” she grumbled, “I better put you on retainer.”
“Retainer? What’s that?”
“It means I pay you something now, and if your work is satisfactory, you get more later.”
“Forget about later. What do I get now?”
“Twenty-five bucks.”
She dug around in her purse and handed over the money. I didn’t bother telling her I’d have taken ten.
Whenever I went to her place, I’d sneak a look at that photo on the beach and try to figure out why she looked so different. She reminded me of the silverware from Daddy’s family that Mama made me polish for the holidays. Mama stored it in soft cloth bags, but the silver still turned dull and looked neglected.
That’s how the old lady looked, but nothing would make her bright and shiny again.
LENA
CAMBRIDGE RESOURCES
When I was a kid, we lived in Watertown, and Lotta practically lived at our house. We’d beg my mother to make Dom and his friends take us when they went to Cambridge, and sometimes she did. We’d hang out near Harvard Square and get a Bartley’s burger or Bailey’s ice cream while the boys cruised around looking for somebody who’d buy them a six-pack or three back then.
Nowadays, boys aren’t the only ones looking for trouble. Headstrong girls like Kalayla did whatever they pleased. I wore out my brain trying to think of something that would keep her off the streets and away from that damn Clean Duds. I was afraid some lowlife might see her there and decide she’d be easy pickings.
Classes at the library were free, but Kalayla was too old for Story Time and too young for films or book discussion groups. I made a few calls about the summer crafts and sports programs and discovered most of them had a fee. Maureen didn’t have extra money, but I’d take care of that if Kalayla were willing to do something besides guard laundry.
The day was sunny and seventy-three degrees, so I got my coffee and was at Clean Duds before 10 a.m. Kalayla was reading a book with her feet propped up as usual.
She looked up and said, “Hey Lena, were you giving your legs a rest yesterday?”
“I was minding my own business, which you’d benefit from doing. You’re turning into a couch potato with no couch. Most kids would rather play sports than lounge in a boring place like this.”
Kalayla gave me a dirty look. “Sports? You mean, like, be on a team with a bunch of jerks?”
Wouldn’t you know she ruled out team sports before I could give her my sales pitch? No matter, she wouldn’t derail my train now that I got it going.
“You could play tennis,” I said. “If you were good enough, you could play singles. Singles, as in by yourself against one other person.”
“I know what singles is! Why’d I waste my time chasing a stupid ball around? Why don’t you suggest something interesting? If you had a gun hidden in one of your white rooms, you could teach me how to shoot.”
I took a deep breath, trying to stay calm. That girl had no idea how much she sounded like one of my twins, and she picked one thing I could teach her if I had a mind to, which I sure as hell did not.
Joey loved guns, and the twins begged to see them. A week didn’t go by without Joey unlocking the footlocker, lifting out one of his precious and caressing it like a lover.
He introduced the boys to shooting the day they turned eight, the age limit for the Highland Gun Club. They started with pistols like I did. Benchrest rifles came next, and when they were strong enough, shotguns. I didn’t care for the heavier guns, so I stuck with the pistol.
Joey pushed me to compete. “You can beat the ass off any of the women, Lena. We’d be the first husband and wife champions!”
I gave in, and we won both titles four years in a row. Joey was the only one I wanted to beat, and I never did.
There was no point in wasting more time in the Clean Duds oven. Kalayla vetoed sports and I was not teaching her to shoot.
When I turned and walked toward the door, Kalaya said, “Is it too hot in here today?”
The following day, I saw her across the street talking to one of the locals, Ray Ray Bingha, who was six feet five inches tall and had two hundred and fifty pounds of muscle. His dark-brown hair was in a ponytail that trailed four inches down his back, but nobody teased him about having a girly hairdo or the two gold earrings in his left ear.
You never saw Ray Ray without Thor, his enormous bullmastiff. You didn’t need a Beware of Dog sign to warn you that Thor would rip out your throat if Ray Ray gave the signal.
Ray Ray and I were on good terms, but there was no guarantee his patience would last if Kalayla got her mouth going. I beat it across that street as fast as my legs could.
“Ray Ray!” I called as I stopped at the curb to catch my breath.
“Well, Miss Lena,” he grinned. “I haven’t seen you in quite some time. I thought you might’ve dropped dead and been buried.”
“I’m not in the habit of trolling the streets like you, Ray Ray. Don’t worry. You’ll know when I die. My son, JJ, will hire a band and invite the whole city to celebrate! I came to warn you this girl has allergic fits when she gets close to dogs. You better keep Thor away from her.”
As usual, Kalayla shifted her mouth into high gear without thinking.
“Where’d you get such a dumb idea, Lena? I love dogs!”
“Whatever,” Ray Ray said, laughing. “I just explained to this little girl that Thor isn’t interested in being her friend.”
“I’m not a little girl, and I don’t want Thor for a friend ’cause he’d probably drool all over me!”
I swear I could have slapped that girl’s face!
Contrary to what she said, Kalayla reached out to pet Thor. Ray Ray’s soft “Don’t!” froze her hand mid-air.
“The only way Thor’d find you likable would be as an appetizer for his dinner. Don’t worry, Miss Lena. he won’t bother this funny little thing. She hasn’t got enough meat on her to make it worthwhile.”
With that, Ray Ray and Thor strolled down Mass. Ave.
Kalayla put her hands on her hips and stamped her foot. “Why’d you run over here, Lena? And why’d you tell that guy I’m allergic to dogs?”
“I must have dreamed it,” I said, taking her arm like I needed something to lean on. “I want you to help sort some books in my storage bin.”
I took deep breaths all the way home. That girl had no more sense than a bug, but covering her mouth with duck tape wouldn’t help. Ray Ray likely had more than one gun tucked away, and if Kalayla ran into him again and the subject came up, teaching her to shoot might give him a laugh.
I needed to consult with Lotta, but first, I had research to do.
***
Cambridge was a good-sized city, but it was like a woman’s handbag with different compartments of different sizes. Information about Kalayla’s family was tucked in one of them, and I knew how to find it.
The members of the Ladies Knitting Club were townies who took great pride in sharing their hoard of information. Not all the members were born in Cambridge, but they grew up nearby. They knew more than a person needed to about the rivalries, tragedies, and trivia of every family in town based on a combination of facts and gossip.
The group boasted it was open to new members, which was something of a joke because you had to know somebody who knew somebody to get in. I never was a knitter and didn’t plan on becoming one, but I wasn’t worried about being welcomed. I’d drop a few snippets about the Manero-Barzetti clan, most of which would be pure fabrication.
The ability to tell good tales while keeping family secrets was a highly prized skill in my family. When we were kids, Nana and Mama taught us to play one note and make it sound like the whole orchestra.
While the ladies dug in their knitting, I circled the room and admired their fine handiwork. I eventually remarked that a girl named Kalayla and her mama had moved in across the hall from me, and the ladies fell all over themselves to tell me what they knew.
Maureen’s husband, Jamal LeeRoyce, came from an established black family in a mixed-race Cambridge neighborhood. They were community-minded Protestants, especially Jamal’s mother, Lucinda. She ran a soup kitchen for their church and occasionally took in stray kids. She was active when it came to rights for blacks. In the days of forced busing, she argued it was a lose-lose situation, and if Judge Garrity took the time to visit Roxbury and South Boston, he’d understand that.
The ladies thought the younger son, Clarence, had mental problems as a kid but was an excellent auto mechanic. The older son, Jamal, was intelligent, good in sports, and went to UMass Boston on a scholarship. He’d died while drag-racing a few years ago.
When I said Maureen’s family must have helped her when her husband died, the ladies set me straight. What they told me was close to unbelievable, and I needed time to let it sink in before I went to see Lotta.
LENA
BEST FRIENDS
Carlotta Eccli had been my best friend forever. Her approach to life was straightforward, with no gray areas, and she thought my approach was incomprehensible. Lotta pointed out that I stayed married to a vicious bastard, refused to dye my hair, and insisted on wearing black, like a corpse, in search of a coffin. To top it off, I lived in a fourth-floor walk-up apartment even though I could afford a penthouse at the Ritz.
I could count on Lotta no matter what. In addition, she was a fabulous cook, so I invited myself to dinner that night. Her house was a half-mile walk from the apartment and helped me stay in shape. Even Lotta admitted I hadn’t loaded on fat like so many of our high school classmates.
Lotta’s house was in a Cambridge neighborhood that boasted yards with trees, shrubs, and lawns. Her neighbors were not pleased when she had a five-foot-high chain-link fence installed in her backyard. “Well,” she told them, “would you prefer dogs running free and shitting all over your lawn?” That was the last she heard from them on that subject.
Lotta redecorated on the spur of the moment, but nothing had changed since my previous visit. Her kitchen was black and white, the living room and dining room pale aqua and the furniture was a Scandinavian design from Form in Teak.
We were finishing the Coq au Vin and buttery noodles when I said, “Did I tell you I went to the last meeting of the Ladies Knitting Club?”
Lotta clanked her fork on her plate. “Now, why would you do something so outrageous and act like it’s normal? You do not knit, have never knitted, and will never knit. Besides, all they do is gossip.”
“That’s why I went. I’m trying to help a fatherless child and her hard-working, widowed mother. I needed to find out a few things. What’s for dessert?”
Lotta rolled her eyes. “Mocha squares drizzled with almond sauce. What were you so hot to find out?”
“The mama told me a story that smelled like dead fish, and her daughter is wandering around Cambridge like it’s her playground. You know how dangerous that can be.”
“Mother, daughter, dead fish? Lena, please explain in plain English.”
“Fine! Maureen is the mother, and Kalayla is her daughter. They moved into the apartment across the hall from me. When I asked Maureen about her family, she changed the subject so fast that my head spun. That seemed odd, so I asked the girl about her mama’s family.
“Kalayla told me the entire family died in an explosion at a party in Brighton before she was born. I don’t remember that. Do you?”
“A story like that would have been plastered on every TV station and the front page of The Globe, The Herald, and all the rags. We couldn’t have missed it!”
“We didn’t. Maureen was lying,” I said, taking a bite of mocha square.
“That’s ridiculous! Why would she?”
“I got the whole history. Maureen’s grandmother and mother moved from Belfast, Ireland, to South Boston to be with family when the grandfather died. Maureen’s mother moved to Brighton when she got married and that’s where Maureen grew up.
“Maureen was one of four children, the family star, a straight-A student, popular and beautiful with green eyes, red hair, and a movie actress figure. She was supposed to become a nurse and marry an Irish boy named Paul O’Brien, whose father owned a law business. At least, that was her mother’s plan.”
“Ha! We all know how those plans work out. Did Maureen suck it up and go along like you did?”
I gave her a dirty look. “No, she didn’t. She fell in love with a black boy from a Protestant family and married him!”
“Oh, my God!” Lotta’s mouth dropped open. She stood up, leaned over the table, and repeated, “Oh my God!”
I had to laugh.
“Right!” I said. “Maureen’s mother disowned her and hasn’t met her granddaughter! Can you believe that?”
Lotta flopped down in her chair. Such a thing was as unimaginable to her as it was to me. She and I came from close-knit Italian-Catholic families. No matter what we did, our families would never turn away from us. Lotta was twice divorced, didn’t want children, and had casual relationships with men, but her parents stood by her. She wasn’t the critical pawn in the family’s business as I had been.
“What a vicious woman!” Lotta said. “And the rest of the family went along with her! But why in hell did Maureen lie? You know as well as I do her daughter will find out, and Maureen will have hell to pay! That woman is a loony tune. Do not open the door if she comes knocking, and do not give her or her daughter another thought!”
I took a sip of coffee and set my cup down carefully. “Funny that you would say that. You never once turned your back on an abused or abandoned animal, even when it caused you a boatload of problems.”
Lotta drove her parents crazy, bringing stray or hurt animals home. She now owned the most respected and best-run animal shelter in Cambridge and the surrounding towns.
Lotta sighed. “It is not the same. Animals can’t help themselves. People can. You’ve got a burr in your side over this, and nothing I say will change your mind. How do you plan to help?”
“Maureen works at Eddie’s. When one of his regular girls quit, I asked him to put her on the days and give her a raise so she wouldn’t have to take cleaning jobs. Kalayla is a disaster waiting to happen, and I have no idea what to do.”
We cleared the table and loaded the dishwasher. Finally, Lotta said, “I’ll make fresh coffee. Tell me what you tried that didn’t work.”
Relief flooded me. “Kalayla refuses to play sports and has no interest in art or any crafts. She hangs out at Clean Duds or roams around alone.”
“That’s good, not good at all.”
While Lotta continued puttering, I settled into a living room chair. Lotta always thought about every possibility before she did anything. In the late 1940s, girls didn’t leave their marriage via a back door, but Lotta did. When she caved into family pressure and married, she convinced her boyfriend they should have a civil ceremony at Watertown City Hall. She knew the Catholic Church didn’t recognize marriages performed by a Justice of the Peace.
Her parents were furious and insisted that she and Stan have a proper wedding, but Lotta was already maneuvering out that back door. Stan’s idea of a good time was slapping her around, and she wasn’t about to put up with that. Her younger brother, Mattwo, had a heavyweight influence in her family, and Lotta went to him for help. He convinced Stan that an annulment would be his best option.
Two years later, Lotta married Jeff Procopio in a civil ceremony. In less than a month, she decided Jeff’s romantic gifts and sappy notes were an irritation rather than a blessing. Mattwo again came to her rescue, and Jeff departed. No one in Lotta’s family mentioned marriage to her again.
I heard the soft hum of the dishwasher. Lotta handed me a coffee mug, flopped on the sofa, and curled her legs under her.
“Maybe we’ll get lucky and find out the girl has as much sense as a cat or a dog,” she said.
I laughed, “So, what do you think?”
Lotta stared at me for a full minute before saying, “You won’t like the idea, but I think Matty’s Way is worth a try. Going there worked for your twins; no sane person would have said they were easy to control.”
I came close to spilling my coffee. What was I thinking? Of course, Lotta would suggest Matty’s Way.
Lotta’s father started Matty’s Way as a dojo for judo and karate in the 1920s. When he retired, Lotta’s brother, Mattwo, took over and added aerobic and strength training classes. His son, Lotta’s nephew, Rico, was next in line to run the gym.

AUTHOR’S INTRODUCTION
My prior novel, Surviving Chaos: How I Found Peace at a Beach Bar,” exposed a lot of characters that affected the life of the author. Besides Mom, Aunt Kathy left a lasting imprint. She was the opposite of all things positive. At the end, it was painfully obvious she deserved a book of her very own.
Most of the contents in this story are recreated from real-life experiences of a lost and misguided kid. Some things have been changed for the sake of a better read. Even though a tiny bit is pure bullshit, it’s all inspired by the events lived by a “lonely and determined little boy.”
Yes, you will be shocked and amazed by the darkness and behaviors of a close blood relative. Look at it this way: logic and Aunt Kathy never coexisted, whereas her philosophies and arbitrary enforcements kept the author off-balance for much of his young life. Somehow, he survived the chaos, abuse, and despicable treatment then and found another way. This story definitely pulls back the covers to that sick, twisted, and formative relationship the author had to endure.
GOOD MORNING HAL
Sometimes forever isn’t long enough!
It was a frosty spring morning in Kabul, Afghanistan. This was ground zero for the Taliban, yet I never felt so free. Fear for others, but peace for me. I was alone and in my own headspace. The cars, horns, stench of sewage, and Islamic morning calls to prayer beckon my attention. Well, no longer did I mind, because the rituals were my clock. The chants came day after day, same time, and same place. Meantime, people and goats made their way to fields, markets, and work. Of course, that was as normal as any other dusty day in a war-torn country.
Sad, because the animals had no voice. Life was a flip of the coin for grass, garbage, or grease. Yet, with any luck, they got to pig out with the trash instead of dinner on a skewer. Even the locals walked a fine line but to nobody’s envy. They were determined and driven, with plenty of needs to go around. Their missions rarely changed. It was always constant and consistent as of yesteryear, yesterday, today, and any time going forward. Their struggles were real and imperative to survive. Food on the table wasn’t a given. So, those cadences of hustle, bustle, and all other distractions were chaotic but never a bother. I really didn’t mind. You see, I was still above ground and able for duty.
However, it was a different kind of day. Old-fashioned gospels blared from my Apple device. Wait a minute! Those tunes weren’t my natural flavor. But somehow, someway, spirituals were loaded into my playlist. It had to be an omen, but why? I didn’t remember doing such a thing. Meantime, I turned off the music and crashed into my pillow.
Something abnormal had taken place in my cyberspace! Then suddenly, right on cue, the phone rang. I let out a groan, rolled over, and reached for that cellular. Man, I couldn’t reach the noise while that buzz continued. Desperately, I cleared books, pens, and a clock off the nightstand. I was willing to do anything to kill that ring.
Finally, my I-phone found me and saved destruction to my accommodation. Unfortunately, it was the least of my problems. Someone from Butt-Fuck, Mississippi had my number, and I knew it. Maybe a beggar or scammer had broken through, which made me exposed and on the spot.
Begrudgingly, I took the call and disguised my voice. Being hacked was my assumption, so I readied myself for the challenged.
A gentleman spoke up and proclaimed he was the famous Pastor Keith of Columbus, Mississippi. If true, I needed to stop and give all reverence to the caller. My head was swimming! “Oh wow! Could it possibly be the guy, the man, ‘The Spirit of The South?’”
“Brother Hal, how are you?” That was a familiar tone. Still, I needed to be sure. No one ever called me “Hal” except close boyhood friends. No way anyone else could’ve known that. Plus, I hadn’t spoken to the pastor since I lost my mother three years ago! “Sir, I’m dealing, and things are OK.” Of course, I lied. I wasn’t on solid footing. I was a man without a family living in a war-torn country. Not only did I work in a hellhole, but Afghanistan was also my refuge. I was sustaining…but not living…life.
Still, I needed to be certain, so I threw a curveball to the caller just to be positive. “Sir, who are you and how did you get this number?” I didn’t want to confess to someone who in fact didn’t know me. Lord knows, I was deeply embedded in sin. No way I wanted such details out in the public.
“Brother, brother Hal, I couldn’t locate any other members of your family, so this obligation fell on me.”
That disclosure gave the stranger a unique piece of authenticity. For sure, my two brothers were as irresponsible as stray cats. Their only purpose in life were ganja, grass, and gusto.
Jerry was the oldest amongst us. He purposely took the lion share of all things good while karma graced him with the bad. Booze was his protector and enemy. Yet, he didn’t give a damn to know the difference.
Tommy was the youngest and a brat on the run. First, being poor and spoiled were an oxymoron regardless how you slice it. Second, Tommy wasn’t anyone to count on. His allegiance was in line with the bottle and blow more than anything else.
Sad, but nothing else mattered to my two siblings except a hit and a swallow. Even words of Mom’s death came from a friend and not a family member, so the Caller indeed had tall legs to stand on.
“Okay! Continue Reverend.” I had no choice but to listen to the news.
“Your Aunt Kathy got called home to Glory last night.” For that moment, I said nothing more. I couldn’t; I was just stunned; Aunt Kathy had actually moved on to another dimension! It finally happened! That lady was damn near invincible! She had survived assaults, coronaries, fevers, famines, flus, floods, plagues, pandemics, strokes, and global warming for almost 100 years. I’m willing to bet she outlived the Ice Age, but there’s no way to confirm it. If anyone told the devil “You’re a Lie,” it was Aunt Kathy. She just had a way of coming back and back like a sequel to a never-ending horror story. Whenever she fell ill, she reappeared as a new being more hostile than the previous entity.
Aunt Kathy was the most dedicated Christian I had ever known. She would give God the glory for everything in her day-to-day existence. Yet, it was her connections to society that put my personal faith in troubled waters. I had never been around such a mixed bag of Christianity and evil. Because of my experiences with Aunt Kathy, I didn’t know whether to fear God or fear the Devil. I was always lost and confused. However, I learned for damn sure, Aunt Kathy had to be reckoned with and should never be taken for granted! Fearing Aunt Kathy gave me a fifty percent chance of being right about God and a fifty percent chance of being wrong about the Devil. Not only did she revel in God’s grace, she also frequently spoke of meeting Jesus in the afterlife. To me, Aunt Kathy was bitter to be alive and happy if she died. She accused the family of dragging her down and standing in the way of her blessings. But that wasn’t all! She’d say, “I’ve got to be ready when the Lord calls me home” and “I got to prepare to leave here.” With arrogance and contempt, Aunt Kathy frequently placed the family beneath her and her world. Heaven was just a hole punch away.
The Pastor went on to say, “I know how much your aunt meant to you and the family. She really tried to direct you guys from little grunts to young men. She was determined to make you all a pillar of Columbus and the Southside community. The congregation felt that love delivered by Sister Kathy!”
Instantly, the pendulum had swung! The Pastor was really pouring it on thick and heavy. I wished he hadn’t gone that far. He was suddenly dumpster diving for something I never possessed. So immediately, I assumed it was a prank call! Or even worse, an imposter trying to punk me. Who would do such a thing? No doubt my family, Zion Gate Union Baptist, and the Southside community needed relief from Aunt Kathy’s dastardly ways. But this was a cruel joke to a sordid degree! The praises dealt by the Pastor forced me to stop and abruptly rest my phone on the coffee table. Out of decency, I didn’t want to dry heave in the ear of that Trickster. If he was indeed delivering the solemn news, his invitation should’ve been for a fireworks celebration on the church grounds. A spell had been lifted and joy returned to Columbus.
Yes, I was related to Aunt Kathy, but the rest of the Reverend’s comments had to be for another parishioner. This lady only had love for my brother Jerry, Pastor Keith, and God. Other than God, I wouldn’t know how to rank her order of affections. Aunt Kathy had no children of her own, and it showed. Throughout my life, she never showed love for any other niece, nephew, or her baby sister, which was Mom. As for friends and associates, well, they were all heathens according to my aunt. She lathered them all with pure damnations behind the scenes. So, if the stranger was truly the fabulous Pastor Keith, he read me the wrong script.
Fortunately, my mom preceded Aunt Kathy in death. I couldn’t help but imagine the trauma she would’ve displayed had she been alive. She might have dipped into a schizophrenic rage at the loss of her dear sister. Aunt Kathy was Mom’s only link to the real world. On-the-other-hand, I saw my aunt as a poor bridge to life for anyone. Due to Mom’s condition, she would attack “The Walls” from sun-up to sun-down and day after day due to her mental paranoia. With the death of her sister, no barrier, partition, fence, or any standing surface would’ve been safe. That kind of trauma would’ve created an endless loop of rages such as: “Oh no! Oh no! Not my sister, you Devil Ass Dawg! Oh Jesus, those Dead Dawg have come and taken my sister away! Help me Jesus! Help me get those Dawg out of my house! Lawd, I can’t take these Dawg howling anymore! Lawd Jesus, bring her back! Lawd, bring her back!”
Of course, I would’ve been the lone pigeon left to hear those tirades and shouts for days on end. Sad to say, it’s really best Mom departed this Earthly coil before Aunt Kathy. Otherwise, my mother would have entered a deeper and darker vacuum unlike anything I’d ever witnessed.
After regaining conscious, I grabbed my phone and heard that peculiar guy. “Man, I missed you. I regret you never accepted a position as my Junior Minister. I need your help with the eulogy of Sister Kathy!” With that data revealed, the Reverend erased all doubt! He was most definitely the legendary Minister of Mississippi!
Aunt Kathy touted me as Pastor Keith, heir apparent to Zion Gate Union Baptist church. It was her way of keeping a foot in the door of heaven. She just had to cover all bases. If ever Pastor Keith got overused or jammed by the prayer line, she’d have me to stand in. Either way, somebody could testify to her holiness.
But once, I accepted the Reverend as the real deal Pastor Keith, a door to “The Twilight Zone” flung wide open. Even that eerie theme music suddenly kicked on in my head. Then, right on cue, Pastor Keith proceeded to walk me down memory lane while his gospels seduced my ears in the background. Yes, those spirituals were a reminder that the Minister was never far from the word. He was God-in-a-bottle to the congregation and to me as well. The faithful were mesmerized whenever he appeared. No, he didn’t walk on water, yet I don’t recall him contacting the ground. The Pastor was never seen without his long black robe. That cape extended from his shoulder to the sod of the earth from the lawn to the top of his lapel. No one ever saw his shoes, so he appeared to levitate in our presence. Without question, he was a step or two bigger than life itself.
But I’m sure he purposely used those Spiritual tunes just for me. Regardless, the music did set a tone. If that wasn’t enough, the chords playing in the distance appeared to increase in volume whenever the Pastor went silent. Yes, I attempted to share my consternations. But he kept harmonizing to his own playlist of songs and left no openings for my opinions. I was just blocked out by his sighs and prayers being mumbled to himself. Or maybe, he was responding to a mournful tirade from a third party on the line. Either way, I heard only Pastor Keith. Those moments were oddly strange and kind of insulting, yet outright freakish for sure.
Still, I had to suffer through his pontifications before advancing to details about Aunt Kathy’s memorial. He continued to deliver such prayers and incantations as, “Yes Lord” and “Guide him Father.” He flooded my head before daring to answer any questions! At one point, I couldn’t differentiate between his engaging me or the rhythm of his gospel. It was the most awkward conversation I’ve ever had with a human being. I wasn’t even sure what to do in that interim.
Next, I heard him say, “Let’s pray for him,” in a soft yet compelling voice! “Yes Lord, let your will be done!” Of course, I had nothing. I was too befuddled and just decided to stay mute. Still, I waited for the Reverend to rejoin me in my feeble world. But the clock ticked on while he gave no sign of addressing my concerns. It was all about the Pastor and his Spirit consoling one another.
No doubt, my interactions with the Minister started out as weird and became more offbeat. Amazingly, I became the parrot in the store. For reasons I can’t explain, “Amen” and “In Jesus’ name,” shot out of my mouth in harmony to the notes serenading my holiness! That was astounding! Somehow, I felt the urge to put on my Holy cap! I was back among the Sanctified again…
Just when I least expected it, the Reverend finally spoke up and came across like a Christian rapper. Every word he dropped was timed to the ebbs and flow of melody coming through the phone. Was it rehearsed? I wasn’t sure, but he was delivering verses of his own. It was unbelievable but all in synch. The Pastor had me on a sliding board and he knew it. Still, despite the onslaught and bombardment, I was able to hold out and yield to the notion of eulogizing my aunt. I was entranced, but history had taught me well. I knew to stand firm and stay worlds away from that lifeless body.
THE COVENANT
Pastor Keith and Zion Gate Union Baptist made the members sign an agreement (1) to attend service on a regular basis or do make-ups in the terms of classes, prayer meetings, or crusades; (2) not to visit other places of worship without Pastor Keith’s approval; and (3) all followers shall give or tithe every other week.
However, Aunt Kathy was just as shrewd as being wicked. First, she had Pastor Keith make a pledge to recognize her as the top servant of all parishioners. Second: after her death, Pastor Keith had to deliver her eulogy right beside her deceased body. Third: her Memorial must be held on a Monday. Since most funerals took place on the weekend, Aunt Kathy wanted top billing to other events in the city. Finally: Pastor Keith had to steer her passage toward heaven.
In return she would keep Zion Gate Union Baptist well-funded. Oh, I didn’t mention: Aunt Kathy had MONEY.
